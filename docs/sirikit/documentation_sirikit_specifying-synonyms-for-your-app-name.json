  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen engaging your app’s services through Siri, users must include the name of your app in any spoken requests. To simplify those requests, you can provide Siri with a list of synonyms for your app name.\n\nTo define synonyms for your app name, include the `INAlternativeAppNames` key in the `Info.plist` file of your iOS app or WatchKit extension. (watchOS apps don’t inherit the synonyms of their iOS app, so you must declare them explicitly in both places). Place this key at the top level of your property list, configure it as an array of dictionaries, and add the following additional keys to each dictionary:\n\nTo localize your app name and pronunciation hints, specify variable names (instead of actual values) for the `INAlternativeAppName` and `INAlternativeAppNamePronunciationHint` keys of each entry. In your app’s `InfoPlist.strings` files, include the variable names as localization keys and set their values to appropriately localized strings. For example, you might set the value of the `INAlternativeAppName` key to `APP_NAME_SYNONYM_1` and include an entry in your `InfoPlist.strings` file such as the following:\n\n`APP_NAME_SYNONYM_1 = \"Localized Name 1\"`\n\nIf you use a variable name for a key, you must provide an entry in your app’s base localization at a minimum. If the system can’t find a specific value for the key in the current localization, it uses the base localization as a fallback.\n\nYou may specify no more than three dictionaries in the array associated with the `INAlternativeAppNames` key. This limit is per localization, so each localized version of your `Info.plist` file may have its own set of alternatives.",
