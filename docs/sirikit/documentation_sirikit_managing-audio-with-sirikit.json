Create an App Group for `com.example.apple-samplecode.ControlAudio.Shared` in your developer portal.\n2. Create an App ID for `com.example.apple-samplecode.ControlAudio` in your developer portal and enable it for App Groups, specifying the group you created in the previous step. Additionally, enable SiriKit.\n3. Create a Music ID for `music.com.example.apple-samplecode.ControlAudio` in your developer portal.\n4. Create a Key for the MusicKit service and create a developer token. For more information on this process, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppleMusicAPI\/generating-developer-tokens].\n5. Copy the developer token to the `developerToken` variable in the `AppleMusicAPIController.swift` file.\n6. Create a provisioning profile for `com.example.apple-samplecode.ControlAudio` and `com.example.apple-samplecode.ControlAudio.ControlAudioExtension` in your developer portal.\n7. Associate the provisioning profiles with the project in Xcode signing settings.\n\n## Sample code\n\n- **Adding Shortcuts for Wind Down**: Reveal your app’s shortcuts inside the Health app.\n- **Booking Rides with SiriKit**: Add Intents extensions to your app to handle requests to book rides using Siri and Maps.\n- **Handling Payment Requests with SiriKit**: Add an Intent Extension to your app to handle money transfer requests with Siri.\n- **Handling Workout Requests with SiriKit**: Add an Intent Extension to your app that handles requests to control workouts with Siri.\n- **Integrating Your App with Siri Event Suggestions**: Donate reservations and provide quick access to event details throughout the system.\n- **Providing Hands-Free App Control with Intents**: Resolve, confirm, and handle intents without an extension.\n- **Soup Chef: Accelerating App Interactions with Shortcuts**: Make it easy for people to use Siri with your app by providing shortcuts to your app’s actions.\n- **Soup Chef with App Intents: Migrating custom intents**: Integrating App Intents to provide your appʼs actions to Siri and Shortcuts.\n\n",
