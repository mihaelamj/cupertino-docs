Maps only interacts with your app extension, but as with Siri, only after the user authorizes it to do so. Request authorization from your iOS app, whether you’re handling intents in an app extension or in your app. When the user approves an authorization request from your iOS app, this grants permission for your iOS app, its Intents app extension, and your watchOS app.\n\n### Configure Your App Target\n\nFirst, enable the Siri capability for your iOS app or WatchKit extension for authorization to succeed. For information about how to enable the Siri capability, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SiriKit\/creating-an-intents-app-extension].\n\nNext, configure your `Info.plist` file. Include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSSiriUsageDescription] key in your iOS appʼs `Info.plist` file. The value for this key is a string that describes what information your app shares with SiriKit. For example, a workout app might set the value to the string *Workout information will be sent to Siri*. This key is a requirement.\n\n### Request User Authorization\n\nCall the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPreferences\/requestSiriAuthorization(_:)] class method of [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPreferences] at some point during your iOS app’s execution.\n\nYour app’s authorization status is [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSiriAuthorizationStatus\/notDetermined] until the user authorizes or denies access. When your app requests authorization and its status is undetermined, the system prompts the user to authorize your app. The alert includes the usage description string you provided in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSSiriUsageDescription] key of your app’s `Info.plist` file.\n\nThe user can approve or deny your app’s request for authorization, and can change your app’s authorization status later in the Settings app. The system remembers your app’s authorization status so that subsequent calls to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPreferences\/requestSiriAuthorization(_:)] method don’t prompt the user again.",
