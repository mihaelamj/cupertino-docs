Your Intents app extension facilitates bill payment from the user to any vendors (such as public utilities) that you previously configured in your app. For all payments, your Intents app extension works with your back-end services to initiate the transfers. The user then follows up on the progress of those transactions in your app.\n\n\n\nSiriKit automatically asks the user to unlock their device when processing any payment-related intents. You can provide a custom interface for payment-related intents using an Intents UI app extension.",
