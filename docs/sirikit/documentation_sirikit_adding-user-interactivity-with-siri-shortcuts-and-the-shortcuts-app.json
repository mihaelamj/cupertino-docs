  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYou can offer your app’s unique capabilities throughout the system by designing custom intents. You may also want to create a custom intent that provides the same functionality as a system intent, to offer users more flexibility for incorporating that functionality into a multi-step shortcut.\n\nDefine custom intents and their parameters in an intents definition file. Xcode uses this file to generate an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INIntent] subclass and related data types for each of your intents.\n\nWhen the user invokes your shortcut with their voice, Siri starts a dialog to collect the additional information needed to complete the shortcut. In the Shortcuts app, the user can make changes to what the shortcut will do when it’s invoked. To get an app that integrates custom intents and parameters, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SiriKit\/soup-chef-accelerating-app-interactions-with-shortcuts] and download the Soup Chef sample app.\n\n### Add an Intent Definition File to Your App Target\n\nChoose File > New > File to add a new SiriKit Intent Definition File to your Xcode project. Make sure that you select your app target.\n\n\n\n### Define Your Intents\n\nCreate the new intent and define what the intent does.\n\nThe figure below shows a custom intent named OrderSoup with the category, title, and description set.\n\n\n\n### Define the Intent Parameters\n\nBefore you can use the intent, you need to define the intent’s parameters such as soup, quantity, and so on. Create a new parameter by clicking the plus button in the Parameters field and selecting either a system parameter type or a custom type in the Type field. System types are predefined by the system, and custom types allow you to create your own types. Parameter names must start with a lowercase character while custom type names must start with an uppercase character.\n\nBy default, Xcode selects the User-facing checkbox. This controls whether the parameter is configurable in the Shortcuts app and resolvable at runtime in both Siri and the Shortcuts app.\n\n\n\n### Add Parameter Metadata and Siri Dialog Data\n\nSiri can prompt users to complete shortcuts that require additional input based on the parameter metadata you provide. Set the Input fields for each parameter that you want the user to have control over, such as allowing them to order different quantities of soup through a shortcut.\n\nYou can also customize the Siri dialog for each parameter resolution result. Enter the phrase you want Siri to say to the app user in the Prompt field.\n\n\n\n### Establish Relationships Between Parameters\n\nUse relationships between parameters to determine whether certain parameters should be  prompted by voice in Siri based on their association with their parent parameter. To set the parent parameter:\n\nThe following example shows the `storeLocation` parameter has a child relationship to the `orderType` parent parameter. The `orderType` parameter is an enum with two values, `pickup` and `delivery`. When the user tells Siri they will pick up their order, the `storeLocation` value is automatically used.\n\n\n\n### Define User-Configurable Shortcuts\n\nUser-configurable shortcuts are shortcuts that the user can configure in the Shortcuts app, and use interactively in Siri. To enable a shortcut for user configuration:\n\nThe following example shows a Shortcut that supports the `soup`, `orderType`, and `deliveryLocation` parameters. The summary contains the `soup` and `orderType` parameters with the `deliveryLocation` in the More Options section.\n\n\n\n### Set Intent Responses and Outputs\n\nAn intent response represents the result of the intent’s action, such as ordering soup. Response templates allow Siri to respond with an appropriate dialog when a success or failure occurs. Add properties to allow passing of data into Siri dialogs or into the shortcut output. The output allows the user to use the result of your shortcut with other actions in the Shortcuts editor.\n\nThe voice-only dialog is spoken instead of the printed dialog in circumstances where the user isn’t looking at a screen, such as on HomePod, CarPlay, and AirPods.\n\nThe following example shows the response for a successful order. It provides the total amount, the user’s order, and the estimated wait time.\n\n",

Make sure that you select your app target.\n\n\n\n### Define Your Intents\n\nCreate the new intent and define what the intent does.\n\n1. Select the created `Intents.intentdefiniton` file.\n2. In the Xcode Menu Bar, choose Editor > New Intent.\n3. Name your intent using a VerbNoun convention, like SetAlarm, CheckOrderStatus, and so on.\n4. Make sure the category you select matches your intent’s purpose because the chosen category defines the default Siri dialog, as you will see in a later section.\n5. In the title field, add a human-readable title for the intent.\n6. In the Description field, add a short sentence that describes what the intent does.\n\nThe figure below shows a custom intent named OrderSoup with the category, title, and description set.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Define the Intent Parameters\n\nBefore you can use the intent, you need to define the intent’s parameters such as soup, quantity, and so on.

To set the parent parameter:\n\n1. Expand the Relationship section.\n2. Select the desired parameter from the Parent Parameter drop-down.\n3. Select when to show the parameter from the Show If Parent drop-down.\n4. If the parent has to have an exact value, select the value from the Value drop-down.\n\nThe following example shows the `storeLocation` parameter has a child relationship to the `orderType` parent parameter. The `orderType` parameter is an enum with two values, `pickup` and `delivery`. When the user tells Siri they will pick up their order, the `storeLocation` value is automatically used.\n\n\n\n### Define User-Configurable Shortcuts\n\nUser-configurable shortcuts are shortcuts that the user can configure in the Shortcuts app, and use interactively in Siri. To enable a shortcut for user configuration:\n\n1. Select the Intent is user-configurable checkbox.\n2. Fill in the Summary field.\n\nThe following example shows a Shortcut that supports the `soup`, `orderType`, and `deliveryLocation` parameters. The summary contains the `soup` and `orderType` parameters with the `deliveryLocation` in the More Options section.\n\n\n\n### Set Intent Responses and Outputs\n\nAn intent response represents the result of the intent’s action, such as ordering soup. Response templates allow Siri to respond with an appropriate dialog when a success or failure occurs. Add properties to allow passing of data into Siri dialogs or into the shortcut output.
