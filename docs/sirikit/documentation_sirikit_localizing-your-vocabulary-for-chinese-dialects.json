Use the number 5 for the neutral tone. Place tones at the end of the Pinyin representation of each character. For example, `ping2 guo3`.\n- You can replace the special character `ü` in Pinyin with `yu`. For example, `nü` would become `nyu`.\n- zh_TW: Taiwan Mandarin localization:\n- Tones are represented using the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Use the number 5 for the neutral tone. Place tones at the end of the Pinyin representation of each character. For example, 蘇打綠 becomes `su1 da3 lyu4`.\n- zh_HK: Hong Kong Cantonese localization:\n- Use the Jyutping 粤语拼音 (粤拼) romanization system for Cantonese.\n- Tones are represented using the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
