In your response to that intent, provide one or more [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideOption] objects representing the rides you’re able to offer.

Make the information as accurate as possible, but understand that you can update the information when actually booking the ride. Here are some tips to creating your [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideOption] objects:\n\n- **Give each ride option a unique, localized name.** Ride option names should convey information about the ride type and be unique so that you can identify them later. When the user selects a ride option for booking, SiriKit passes only the option name back to you. So you must be able to identify the ride type from that string.\n- **Configure the party size options when party size determines pricing.** If the number of people receiving a ride determines the price, configure the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideOption\/availablePartySizeOptions] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideOption\/availablePartySizeOptionsSelectionPrompt] properties appropriately. Use your [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRidePartySizeOption] objects to specify the pricing information for parties of different sizes.\n- **Use fare line items to enumerate individual costs.** When the cost of a ride isn’t a single fixed value, provide fare line items so that the user understands how the app computed the fare. Line items can include base charges, per-mile charges, additional fees or tolls, and discounts.\n- **Include an expiration date.** Expiration dates prevent your ride options from becoming stale or outdated. When a ride option expires, SiriKit sends another [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INListRideOptionsIntent] object to your Intents extension.\n- **If your app must complete the booking, provide an appropriate user activity object.** You might complete the booking in your app when special circumstances apply, such as when you need to change the precise pickup or drop-off location. Assigning an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] object to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideOption\/userActivityForBookingInApplication] property of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideOption] tells Maps that it must launch your app to complete the booking.\n\nThe following figure shows how Maps reveals the party size details to the user. When selecting a vehicle, Maps displays the base price range initially. When the user actually requests the vehicle, Maps prompts the user to select the number of passengers.
