  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf your app donated a shortcut containing information that the user has since deleted, your app should delete the donation. For example, let’s say that a user sends a message to a contact using your messaging app. Your app donates the *send message* shortcut that includes information about the contact. Later, the user deletes that contact from the app. The app should delete the donations it made that included the contact information.\n\nWhen a user deletes data from an app, they expect the data to be gone for good. This means removing the data from the app as well as from the system—if the system has knowledge of that data. It’s important for your app to honor this unspoken agreement with the user: to maintain privacy and trust at all times.\n\nThere are other times your app should delete donations; for instance, when your app no longer supports the action. In general, whenever a donation is no longer appropriate for the user, your app should delete the donation.\n\n### Delete Interaction Donations\n\nTo delete donations made with interaction objects, use one of the `delete` class methods on [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction] (see Deleting Interactions from the System). To delete specific donations, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction\/delete(with:completion:)-2d1gs], passing in the list of [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction\/identifier] strings for each interaction to delete. Or use [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction\/delete(with:completion:)-tcq9], passing in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction\/groupIdentifier] string used to group of two or more interactions.\n\nIf you need to delete all interactions that your app donated—for example, when the user signs out of your app—use [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction\/deleteAll(completion:)].\n\n### Delete User Activity Donations\n\nThe method you use to delete a donation made with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] depends on how you set up the user activity.\n\n#### Persisted Activities\n\nIf user activity’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/isEligibleForPrediction] property is set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/persistentIdentifier] property is set to a unique string identifying the activity, then:\n\n#### Spotlight Indexed Activities\n\nIf the user activity is indexed in Spotlight and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreSpotlight\/CSSearchableItemAttributeSet\/relatedUniqueIdentifier] property is set to a unique string identifying the activity, then:\n\nWhen you delete a Spotlight item, the system deletes the related user activity and its donations.\n\nFor more information about Spotlight indexing, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreSpotlight].",
