Your app donates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction] object that contains information about the reservation that can be sent to the user to allow them to confirm a hotel reservation, remind them to check in for a flight, help them return a rental car, and several other options.\n\nApps offering reservations with check-in capabilities can integrate with Shortcuts Suggestions on the Lock Screen and allow users to launch your app to complete checking in for their reservation. Create a new reservation object with an array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INReservationAction] objects that contain a user activity and relevant time frame. Siri provides users with the ability to launch your app with the user activity and time frame information. For instance, a flight reservation app may provide users the ability to check-in for a flight starting 24 hours before the departure time.",
