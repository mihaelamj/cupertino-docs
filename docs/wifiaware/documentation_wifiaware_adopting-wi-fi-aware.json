Your app can use the Wi-Fi Aware framework to securely establish peer-to-peer (P2P) connections between Wi-Fi devices.\n\nIf you intend your app to use Wi-Fi Aware capabilities, you need to add the `com.apple.developer.wifi-aware` entitlement. The value of the entitlement is an array of capability strings, where the strings specify the Wi-Fi Aware operations and API capabilities your app intends to use.\n\n\n\n## Declare services\n\nServices are the specific functionality and protocols that your app can either provide to other devices or consume from other devices. There are two supported service roles in Wi-Fi Aware:\n\n- **Publisher**: Your app hosts the service and acts as a server that allows incoming connections from other paired devices. For example, your app publishes its availability to other devices to print documents.\n- **Subscriber**: Your app uses the service and acts as the client that makes outgoing connections to other paired devices. For example, your app finds friends to connect to in a game.\n\nWi-Fi Aware can support multiple services simultaneously, and can also act as a publisher, subscriber, or both. As such, your app can:\n\n- Publish one or more services.\n- Subscribe to one or more services.\n- Simultaneously publish and subscribe the same services.\n- Publish one set of services, while subscribing to a different set of services.\n\n\n\nDeclare the services you want to use with the WiFiAwareServices key in your app’s Information property list. The key’s value is the dictionary where *keys* are names of services your app uses and *values* are dictionaries of service configuration information, which is in the Info pane of the target editor in Xcode.\n\nEach key under the `WiFiAwareServices` entry is the fully qualified name of a service as it’s sent over the air. It’s populated in the `name` field of the resulting [doc:\/\/com.apple.wifiaware\/documentation\/WiFiAware\/WAPublishableService] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.wifiaware\/documentation\/WiFiAware\/WASubscribableService] structures in the API. For a service name to be valid, it must conform to the rules in [https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/html\/rfc6763#section-4.1.2] and [https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/html\/rfc6335#section-5.1].\n\nThe service string needs to have a unique name that:\n\n- Only uses characters such as `a–z`, `A–Z`, `0–9`, and hyphen (`-`)\n- Uses at least one letter `a–z` or `A–Z`\n- Doesn’t start or end with a hyphen (`-`)\n- Doesn’t exceed 15 characters\n\nThe fully qualified service name string needs to have:\n\n- An underscore (`_`) before the name of the component\n- A dot (`.`) separator\n- A protocol suffix of `_tcp` or `_udp`\n\nThe following examples show service names that follow the naming conventions:\n\n\n\nUse the exact same name in the `Info.plist`. Invalid service names in the `Info.plist` cause your app to crash.\n\n### Configure a service\n\nFor each service name key in the `WiFiAwareServices` dictionary, there’s a corresponding value dictionary. This dictionary contains a set of properties that configure each individual service. The configuration includes whether the service is published, subscribed, or both:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an example of an `Info.plist` that declares a single service `_example-service._tcp` that’s both published and subscribed:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-\/\/Apple\/\/DTD PLIST 1.0\/\/EN\" \"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/DTDs\/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>CFBundleIdentifier<\/key>\n    <string>com.example.MyApp<\/string>\n    <key>WiFiAwareServices<\/key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>_example-service._tcp<\/key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Publishable<\/key>\n            <dict\/>\n            <key>Subscribable<\/key>\n            <dict\/>\n        <\/dict>\n    <\/dict>\n<\/dict>\n<\/plist>\n```\n\n### Access API services\n\nAfter you declare the services your app uses in `Info.plist`, your app can access those services with the Wi-Fi Aware API. For each `Publishable` service, the system creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.wifiaware\/documentation\/WiFiAware\/WAPublishableService] available in [doc:\/\/com.apple.wifiaware\/documentation\/WiFiAware\/WAPublishableService\/allServices].
