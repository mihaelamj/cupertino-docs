Your app can use the Wi-Fi Aware framework to connect with Wi-Fi Aware certified accessories. The framework offers a secure and standardized way to establish peer-to-peer (P2P) connections between Wi-Fi devices, providing networking capabilities such as:\n\n- High-bandwidth and low-latency data transfers\n- Connections to paired devices that are authenticated and encrypted at the Wi-Fi layer\n- Simultaneous connections to multiple Wi-Fi Aware devices\n- Simultaneous use of Wi-Fi Aware devices and a Wi-Fi infrastructure network\n- Fully peer-to-peer topology, allowing peers to come and go without breaking connections to other peers\n\nThe Wi-Fi Aware technology works without the need for Wi-Fi infrastructure networks, cellular links, internet connections, or cloud servers.
