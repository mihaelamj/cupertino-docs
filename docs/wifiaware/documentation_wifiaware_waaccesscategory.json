This allows your app to specify how the Wi-Fi layer transmits the `NetworkConnection`’s data packets, selecting the performance characteristics that are relevant to the data flow.\n\nWi-Fi is a shared medium, so all Wi-Fi devices, networks, apps, and  `NetworkConnection`s share the overall Wi-Fi capacity between them. An app can improve the performance of its data flows, and that of all other nearby devices and Wi-Fi networks, by choosing the lowest QoS category that meets the requirements of each of its flows. When in doubt, use the default `.bestEffort` category.\n\nFor more information, refer to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/network\/nwparameters\/serviceclass-swift.enum] and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/network\/nwparameters].\n\nAccess categories are typically created by the system on behalf of the client, so they usually don’t need to be instantiated directly.",
