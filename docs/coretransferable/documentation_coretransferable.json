Use transferable types for system interactions that move or share data, like the Share button, drag and drop, and copy and paste.\n\nCore Transferable defines a core protocol, [doc:\/\/com.apple.CoreTransferable\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/Transferable], that you adopt in your app’s model types. Provide a transfer representation by composing one or more of the framework’s built-in [doc:\/\/com.apple.CoreTransferable\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/TransferRepresentation] types. Use `Transferable` types together with system frameworks like SwiftUI — that include types such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ShareLink] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PasteButton] — to share and paste transferable data. SwiftUI also includes view modifiers like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/draggable(_:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/dropDestination(for:action:isTargeted:)] that support drag-and-drop interactions using `Transferable`. System types like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/String], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Data], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image] already conform to `Transferable`.\n\nYou can send or receive `Transferable` items within an app, among a collection of your own apps, or between your apps and other apps that share an understanding of how to import or export a known data format. The following shows an example model type, `Note`, that’s extended to conform to `Transferable`:\n\nUse Core Transferable along with the collection of common file and data transfer identifiers from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UniformTypeIdentifiers] framework to take advantage of system interactions that move and share data using standard file types or your own custom-defined file types.",
