For example,  a `Note` type might use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/String] structure’s built-in [doc:\/\/com.apple.CoreTransferable\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/Transferable] conformance — a plain text representation — so it can be pasted into any text editor:\n\n`ProxyRepresentation` makes it easy to provide alternative representations for receivers that don’t support the preferred custom format.\n\nWrite the order of the representations in the `transferRepresentation` property from more preferred to less preferred. In the previous example, if the receiver knows about the custom `com.example.todo` content type, it will receive that custom content type. Using a `ProxyRepresentation` as the alternative lets people paste the to-do item in any text editor that doesn’t support the `com.example.todo` content type but works with text formats.\n\n`ProxyRepresentation` is a convenience, and its evaluation isn’t supposed to be calculation-heavy. Don’t perform long-running work in `exporting` and `importing` closures. They shouldn’t contain network requests, file operations, or other potentially time-consuming tasks as they can cause delays during operations with `Transferable` items.\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/FileRepresentation] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/DataRepresentation] to read and write files or for other lengthy tasks.",
