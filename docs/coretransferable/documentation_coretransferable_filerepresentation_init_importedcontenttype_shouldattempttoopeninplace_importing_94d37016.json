If `false`, the receiver only has access to a copy of the file made by the system.\n- **importing**: A closure that creates the item with given file promise. The file referred to by the `file` property of the `ReceivedTransferredFile` is only guaranteed to exist within the `importing` closure. If you need the file to be around for a longer period, make a copy in the `importing` closure.\n\n## Creating a transfer representation\n\n- **init(contentType:shouldAttemptToOpenInPlace:exporting:importing:)**: Creates a transfer representation for importing and exporting transferable items as files.\n- **init(exportedContentType:shouldAllowToOpenInPlace:exporting:)**: Creates a transfer representation for exporting transferable items as files.\n\n",
