For example, if you are sharing a PDF file, declare a [doc:\/\/com.apple.CoreTransferable\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/FileRepresentation] of a `UTType.pdf` content type, instead of `UTType.fileURL` or `UTType.content` so the data can be dragged, shared, or imported to apps that support that data type:\n\nIt’s efficient to pass data around as a file and the receiver loads it into memory only if it’s required.",
