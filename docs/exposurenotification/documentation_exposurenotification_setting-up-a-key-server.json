  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nApps that use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification] framework rely on a key server to identify potential exposure to individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The key server is responsible for collecting and distributing exposure keys to allow on-device exposure detection. This article describes how to provide the data that allows exposure notification to work, and details the data format the [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification] framework requires.\n\nA key server, at a minimum, must allow exposure notification clients to:\n\nIf providing a client app, a Health Authority can choose how to implement these capabilities as long as the data that passes to and from the exposure notification client conforms to the data formats this article describes. To support Exposure Notifications Express, which allows exposure notifications without an app in iOS 13.7 and above, a key server’s functionality must conform to specific requirements. For more information on how to support Exposure Notifications Express with your key server, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/configuring-a-key-server-for-exposure-notifications-express].\n\nGoogle has created an [https:\/\/github.com\/google\/exposure-notifications-server\/]that you can use as a reference, or as a starting point for creating your own key server.\n\nBefore you begin setting up your key server, [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/contact\/request\/exposure-notification-entitlement]. Once your request is accepted, you’ll be asked to provide information that clients will use to authenticate the data they receive from your server, such as its public key.\n\n### Reject Invalid Temporary Exposure Keys\n\nA key server must reject invalid key files uploaded from a client app. Uploaded key data is considered invalid if:\n\nIf `TEKRollingPeriod` is not included, use a default value of 144. You may optionally want to validate the clock time the device submits.\n\nFor detailed information on implementing key validity checks, see [https:\/\/covid19-static.cdn-apple.com\/applications\/covid19\/current\/static\/contact-tracing\/pdf\/ExposureNotification-CryptographySpecificationv1.2.pdf].\n\n### Take Precautions with Temporary Exposure Keys\n\nTo help ensure that the data sent to client devices canʼt be used to reveal a userʼs identity, your key server:\n\n### Sign Downloads with the Latest Registered Certificate\n\nA key server must always sign files with the private key that corresponds to the latest public key provided to Apple using SHA-256 with ECDSA. Exposure notification clients reject keys retrieved from a server when they can’t verify them against the current public key.\n\n### Package Temporary Exposure Key Data in a Zip Archive\n\nA key server must deliver diagnosis key data to clients as a zip archive that contains two files, both stored at the root level, and both with the same base name, but different extensions. The file that contains the temporary exposure key data must have the extension `.bin` and the file that contains the signature and signature-verification metadata must have the extension `.sig`.\n\nA key server can send multiple zip archives to the same client, but each archive sent at the same time must use different base names for the contained files. For compatibility, send a maximum of 15 key files to a single client in a 24-hour period, because clients running on iOS 13.5 and earlier are limited to 15 key files in this time frame.\n\nFor best results, zip archives should be no larger than 16 MB and contain no more than 750,000 keys.\n\nThe `.bin` file in the zip archive is a binary file that begins with a 16-byte header that contains `​EK Export v1`​  in UTF-8 encoding, right-padded with whitespace characters. This header represents the current version of the exposure-key binary format. The header is followed by a serialized ​protocol buffer​ message named `TemporaryExposureKeyExport`,​ which uses the following protocol buffer definition:\n\nThe `.sig` file in the archive contains the signature and information the client needs to validate the download. The key server generates the signature file by serializing a single `TEKSignatureList` protocol buffer message, which uses the following protocol buffer definition:\n\nTo calculate the `signature` data inside a `TEKSignature` message, start by generating a digest of the data file in the archive using the SHA-256 hash algorithm. Then, sign the digest value using the ECDSA with P-256 algorithm. The private key you use for signing must be the one that corresponds to the public key registered with Appleʼs key server.",
