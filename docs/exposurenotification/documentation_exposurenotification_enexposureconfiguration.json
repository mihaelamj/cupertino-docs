  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe ExposureNotification framework defines an Exposure Risk Value (ERV) to allow Health Authorities to define when to alert a user that they may have been exposed to someone diagnosed with COVID-19. The app uses the ERV to calculate the user’s Meaningful Exposure Minutes (MEMs) value. Health Authorities have flexibility in calculating this value by setting weights and values related to Bluetooth attenuations, infectiousness of the affected individual, and diagnosis report type. They can also determine what threshold will result in a notification.\n\nThe calculation method described in this document is available starting with iOS 14. To adopt this method of risk assessment, set the `ENAPIVersion` key to the integer value 2 in the app’s `Info.plist` file. For more information on the V1 calculation used in earlier versions of iOS, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/exposure-risk-value-calculation-in-exposurenotification-version-1].\n\nThe following diagram shows how to calculate an ERV:\n\n\n\nThe class defines three sets of weights that give priority to the components of the ERV: minutes-at-attenuation, infectiousness, and report type.\n\nThe weighted minutes-at-attenuation assigns priority to the amount of time that the user is near beacons at different Bluetooth attenuations. Assign values between 0–250 percent to weights that represent Immediate, Near, Medium, and Other distances.\n\n\n\nThe infectiousness weight modifies the ERV based on the affected userʼs infectiousness level for the day of exposure relative to the day of symptom onset. To set the infectiousness level for when there is no symptom onset date provided, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENDaysSinceOnsetOfSymptomsUnknown]. A user’s infectiousness level can be [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENInfectiousness\/high], [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENInfectiousness\/standard], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENInfectiousness\/none]. Assign both [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureConfiguration\/infectiousnessHighWeight] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureConfiguration\/infectiousnessStandardWeight] a value between 0 percent and 250 percent.\n\n\n\nThe weighted report type assigns priority to the method of diagnosis. Assign values ranging from 0–250 percent to weights that represent a confirmed test diagnosis, clinical diagnosis, self- reported diagnoisis, and recursive diagnosis.\n\n\n\nIn addition to setting the weights, you can perform additional filtering by setting [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureConfiguration\/daysSinceLastExposureThreshold] to limit the number of days to consider when calculating the risk level.\n\n### Calculating an Example Exposure Risk Value\n\nThe following diagrams illustrate calculating an ERV using a real-world scenario.\n\nThe weighted minutes-at-attenuation shows 5 minutes of immediate exposure with a 150 percent weight, 10 minutes of near exposure with a 100 percent weight, 10 minutes of medium exposure with a 50 percent weight, and 5 minutes of other exposure with a 0 percent weight.\n\n\n\nThe weighted infectiousness indicates days –14 to –6 from the current day with no infectiousness, days –5 to –3 with 100 percent of standard infectiousness, days –2 to +5 with 200 percent high infectiousness, days +6 to +10 with 100 percent standard infectiousness, and days +11 to +14 with no infectiousness.\n\n\n\nHere are the weighted report types for all three tests:\n\n\n\nThe result of the calculation shows an ERV of 45 minutes:\n\n",
