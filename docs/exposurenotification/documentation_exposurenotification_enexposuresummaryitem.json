  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe exposure summary item provides a summary of exposures for a particular day. The framework computes this summary by compiling values for a [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureSummaryItem\/weightedDurationSum], a [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureSummaryItem\/maximumScore] (the maximum of the exposure risk values), and a [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureSummaryItem\/scoreSum]. This summary of exposures can be for a specific report type ([doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureDaySummary\/confirmedTestSummary]) or a combination across all report types ([doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureDaySummary\/daySummary]). An instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.exposurenotification\/documentation\/ExposureNotification\/ENExposureDaySummary] contains the exposure summary item.\n\nTo illustrate how the framework computes this value, assume Alice encounters Bob, Carol, and Dave on a particular day; each person has weights set by their respective Public Health Authority.\n\nBob’s minutes-at-attenuation weight is 50, his infectiousness weight is 100%, and his report type weight is 200% (a confirmed test).
