complications\n\n**API Collection**\n\nAllow people to personalize their devices, view relevant information, and perform interactions with widgets and watch complications.\n\n## Overview\n\nUse WidgetKit to create widgets and watch complications that elevate a small amount of timely, personally relevant information from your app and allow people to perform quick actions without launching your app:\n\n- On iPhone and iPad, people put widgets in Today View, on the Home Screen, and on the Lock Screen.\n- On Mac, people place macOS widgets and widgets from a paired iPhone in locations like the Mac desktop and in Notification Center.\n- On Apple Watch, widgets appear in the Smart Stack and as watch complications.\n- On Apple Vision Pro, widgets become three-dimensional objects that people pin to horizontal and vertical surfaces.\n- In CarPlay, people configure iPhone widgets to appear on the widgets screen.\n\n## Widget creation\n\n- **Creating a widget extension**: Display your app’s content in a convenient, informative widget on various devices.\n- **Developing a WidgetKit strategy**: Explore features, tasks, related frameworks, and constraints as you make a plan to implement widgets, controls, watch complications, and Live Activities.\n- **Emoji Rangers: Supporting Live Activities, interactivity, and animations**: Offer Live Activities, controls, animate data updates, and add interactivity to widgets.\n- **Preparing widgets for additional platforms, contexts, and appearances**: Create widgets that support additional platforms and adapt to their context.\n-

push information about widget refreshes and relevance refreshes.\n- **WidgetPushInfo**: A structure that contains information about the push token for updating widgets and widget relevances.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- **Accessing location information in widgets**: Incorporate location information into your widget presentation to make it more relevant and contextual.\n- **Making network requests in
