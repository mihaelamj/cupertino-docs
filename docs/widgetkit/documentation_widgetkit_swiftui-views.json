Use the views listed below to implement your widget’s view.\n\n\n\n## Displaying text\n\n- **Displaying dynamic dates in widgets**: Show up-to-date, time-based information in your widget even when it isn’t running.\n- **Text**: A view that displays one or more lines of read-only text.\n\n## Showing images\n\n- **Image**: A view that displays an image.\n\n## Adding interaction\n\n- **Adding interactivity to widgets and Live Activities**: Include buttons or toggles in a widget or Live Activity to offer app functionality without launching the app.\n- **Button**: A control that initiates an action.\n- **Toggle**: A control that toggles between on and off states.\n\n## Adding labels and links\n\n- **Label**: A standard label for user interface items, consisting of an icon with a title.\n- **Link**: A control for navigating to a URL.\n\n## Stacking views\n\n- **HStack**: A view that arranges its subviews in a horizontal line.\n- **VStack**: A view that arranges its subviews in a vertical line.\n- **ZStack**: A view that overlays its subviews, aligning them in both axes.\n- **LazyHStack**: A view that arranges its children in a line that grows horizontally, creating items only as needed.\n- **LazyVStack**: A view that arranges its children in a line that grows vertically, creating items only as needed.\n\n## Arranging views in grids\n\n- **LazyHGrid**: A container view that arranges its child views in a grid that grows horizontally, creating items only as needed.\n- **LazyVGrid**: A container view that arranges its child views in a grid that grows vertically, creating items only as needed.\n- **GridItem**: A description of a row or a column in a lazy grid.\n\n## Enumerating lists\n\n- **ForEach**: A structure that computes views on demand from an underlying collection of identified data.\n\n## Grouping views\n\n- **Group**: A type that collects multiple instances of a content type — like views, scenes, or commands — into a single unit.\n- **GroupBox**: A stylized view, with an optional label, that visually collects a logical grouping of content.\n- **Section**: A container view that you can use to add hierarchy within certain views.\n\n## Representing hierarchies\n\n- **OutlineGroup**: A structure that computes views and disclosure groups on demand from an underlying collection of tree-structured, identified data.\n\n## Adding spacers and dividers\n\n- **Spacer**: A flexible space that expands along the major axis of its containing stack layout, or on both axes if not contained in a stack.\n- **Divider**: A visual element that can be used to separate other content.\n\n## Handling conditional views\n\n- **EmptyView**: A view that doesn’t contain any content.\n- **EquatableView**: A view type that compares itself against its previous value and prevents its child updating if its new value is the same as its old value.\n\n## Displaying shapes\n\n- **Rectangle**: A rectangular shape aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n- **RoundedRectangle**: A rectangular shape with rounded corners, aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n- **Circle**: A circle centered on the frame of the view containing it.\n- **Ellipse**: An ellipse aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n- **Capsule**: A capsule shape aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n- **Path**: The outline of a 2D shape.\n\n## Transforming views\n\n- **ScaledShape**: A shape with a scale transform applied to it.\n- **RotatedShape**: A shape with a rotation transform applied to it.\n- **OffsetShape**: A shape with a translation offset transform applied to it.\n- **TransformedShape**: A shape with an affine transform applied to it.\n- **ContainerRelativeShape**: A shape that is replaced by an inset version of the current container shape. If no container shape was defined, is replaced by a rectangle.\n\n## Styling views\n\n- **Color**: A representation of a color that adapts to a given context.\n- **ImagePaint**: A shape style that fills a shape by repeating a region of an image.\n- **Gradient**: A color gradient represented as an array of color stops, each having a parametric location value.\n- **LinearGradient**: A linear gradient.\n- **AngularGradient**: An angular gradient.\n- **RadialGradient**: A radial gradient.\n- **ForegroundStyle**: The foreground style in the current context.\n- **FillStyle**: A style for rasterizing vector shapes.\n- **BackgroundStyle**: The background style in the current context.\n- **SelectionShapeStyle**: A style used to visually indicate selection following platform conventional colors and behaviors.\n- **SeparatorShapeStyle**: A style appropriate for foreground separator or border lines.\n- **StrokeStyle**: The characteristics of a stroke that traces a path.\n\n## Creating 2D graphics\n\n- **Canvas**: A view type that supports immediate mode drawing.\n\n## Managing view geometry\n\n- **GeometryProxy**: A proxy for access to the size and coordinate space (for anchor resolution) of the container view.\n- **GeometryReader**: A container view that defines its content as a function of its own size and coordinate space.\n- **ProjectionTransform**\n\n## Substituting views\n\n- **AnyView**: A type-erased view.\n- **TupleView**: A View created from a swift tuple of View values.\n\n## Presentation\n\n- **Creating views for widgets, Live Activities, and watch complications**: Implement glanceable views with WidgetKit and SwiftUI.\n\n",
