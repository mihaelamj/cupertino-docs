A toggle can turn a light on and off, or open and close a garage door. People place controls in prominent locations to personalize how they use their devices:\n\n- On devices with an Action button, people can place a controls action in the Action button.\n- On iPhone and iPad, people place controls in Control Center and on the Lock Screen.\n- On Mac, people place controls from your macOS app in Control Center or as menu bar items.\n- On Apple Watch, people place controls from your watchOS app or from a paired iPhone in Control Center or the Smart Stack. If you offer watchOS app in addition to an iPhone app and both apps offer controls, people can only place controls from your watchOS app in Control Center or the Smart Stack.\n\nTo offer a control for your app, use WidgetKit API to configure and update the control,  create its layout with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI], and perform its action using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppIntents].
