  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nIn watchOS, the system displays accented widget-based complications on many watch faces. For example, when the user selects a color, the Infograph watch face uses white for the default group, and the user-selected color for the accent. However, these colors can change from face to face. In the X-Large watch face, the system applies the selected color to the default group, and colors the accent group white. Other faces use system-defined colors for both groups; for example, the Solar Dial face defines both an accent and a default color, and changes these colors based on the time of day.\n\nWhen applying the colors, the system treats the widget’s views as if they were template images. It replaces the view’s color — rendering the new colors while preserving the view’s alpha channel.\n\nTo control your view’s appearance, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/widgetAccentable(_:)] modifier to part of your view’s hierarchy. The system adds that view and all of its subviews to the accent group. It puts all other views in the default group.",
