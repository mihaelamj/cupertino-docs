To support StandBy and CarPlay appearances, update your small widget:\n\n- Make the background removable.\n- Focus on showing only glanceable information.\n- Use larger typography, and make it easy to read from a distance.\n\nFor more information about making a background removable and optimizing your widget for additional contexts, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Preparing-widgets-for-additional-contexts-and-appearances#Update-your-small-widget-to-support-StandBy-and-CarPlay].\n\nIf your widget isn’t a good fit for StandBy or CarPlay, consider marking the applicable context as a disfavored location as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Preparing-widgets-for-additional-contexts-and-appearances#Indicate-that-a-widget-might-not-fit-a-specific-context]. Doing so doesn’t exclude your widget from CarPlay or StandBy, but it communicates to people that these locations aren’t the best fit.\n\n### Linking to your app in CarPlay and using buttons or toggles\n\nIn CarPlay, the way your widget links to your app depends on the specific context of using your app in a vehicle:\n\n- If the vehicle  supports touch input and your app supports CarPlay integration, tapping the widget or one of its buttons opens the app’s CarPlay template.\n- If the vehicle supports touch input but your app doesn’t integrate with CarPlay, people can’t open your app from the widget and the system dims it to indicate that a tap doesn’t have an effect.\n- If the vehicle doesn’t support touch input, people can’t open your app from the widget.\n\nFor additional information about linking to your app from your widget, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Linking-to-specific-app-scenes-from-your-widget-or-Live-Activity#Review-linking-behavior-in-CarPlay].\n\n\n\nAdditionally, your widget’s buttons and toggles behave differently to match the CarPlay context:\n\n- If the vehicle supports touch input, people tap a widget’s buttons and toggles to perform their functionality.\n- If the vehicle doesn’t have a touchscreen, widgets and buttons are inactive, and people can’t tap the widget to open your app in CarPlay or on their phone.\n\n\n\n### Test widgets in CarPlay\n\nTo test widgets in CarPlay, preview your widget in Xcode to verify that your widget works in StandBy and the CarPlay Simulator. For more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Previewing-widgets-and-live-activities-in-xcode] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CarPlay\/using-the-carplay-simulator].\n\n## Layout and presentation\n\n- **Supporting additional widget sizes**: Offer widgets in additional contexts by adding support for various widget sizes.\n- **Displaying the right widget background**: Group your widget’s background views and mark them as removable to ensure your widget appears correctly for each context and platform.\n- **Optimizing your widget for accented rendering mode and Liquid Glass**: Make your widget feel at home on Apple platforms and Liquid Glass by using accented rendering mode.\n- **WidgetRenderingMode**: Constants that indicate the rendering mode for a widget.\n- **WidgetAccentedRenderingMode**: Constants that indicate the rendering mode for an `Image` in when displayed in a widget in [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetRenderingMode\/accented] mode.\n- **AccessoryWidgetBackground**: An adaptive background view that provides a standard appearance based on the the widget’s environment.\n- **WidgetLocation**: Values that indicate different widget locations.\n\n",
