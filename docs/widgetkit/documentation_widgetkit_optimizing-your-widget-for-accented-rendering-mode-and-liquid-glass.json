When a person chooses a tinted or clear appearance for their Home Screen, the system:\n\n- Renders your widget in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetRenderingMode\/accented] rendering mode\n- Tints primary and accented content white in iOS and macOS\n- Tints primary content white and accented content in the color of the watch face in watchOS\n- Tints opaque images with a single white color\n- Maintains opacity for transparent content and gradients, and tints them white\n- Removes the background and replaces it with a themed glass or tinted color effect\n\nBy already supporting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetRenderingMode\/accented] rendering mode, some widgets don’t need any further adjustments. However, you might need to update your widget to keep its text readable and make it look at home with Liquid Glass; for example, if your widget includes images, gradients, or transparent content.\n\n### Support Liquid Glass\n\nTo update your widget to support Liquid Glass:\n\n1. Add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/widgetRenderingMode] environment variable and conditionally update your widget layout for each rendering mode as explained in the previous section.\n2. Display full-color images, page, or partially transparent content only for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetRenderingMode\/fullColor] rendering mode.\n3. Adjust your widget’s layout as needed for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetRenderingMode\/accented] rendering mode.\n4. Group your views into a primary and an accent group using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/widgetAccentable(_:)] view modifier. Views you don’t mark as acceptable are part of the primary group.\n5. Configure the rendering of any image using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetAccentedRenderingMode] view modifier.\n\n### Choose rendering modes for images and views\n\nUsing the `WidgetAccentedRenderingMode` view modifier, conditionally render images and views as needed:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about Liquid Glass and how to design and develop interfaces that work well with the material, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/TechnologyOverviews\/liquid-glass] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/TechnologyOverviews\/adopting-liquid-glass].\n\n## Layout and presentation\n\n- **Supporting additional widget sizes**: Offer widgets in additional contexts by adding support for various widget sizes.\n- **Displaying the right widget background**: Group your widget’s background views and mark them as removable to ensure your widget appears correctly for each context and platform.\n- **Adding StandBy and CarPlay support to your widget**: Ensure that your small system family widget works well in StandBy and CarPlay.\n- **WidgetRenderingMode**: Constants that indicate the rendering mode for a widget.\n- **WidgetAccentedRenderingMode**: Constants that indicate the rendering mode for an `Image` in when displayed in a widget in [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetRenderingMode\/accented] mode.\n- **AccessoryWidgetBackground**: An adaptive background view that provides a standard appearance based on the the widget’s environment.\n- **WidgetLocation**: Values that indicate different widget locations.\n\n",
