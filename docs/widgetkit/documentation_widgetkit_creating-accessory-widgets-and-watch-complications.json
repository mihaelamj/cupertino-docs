Accessory widgets also appear as watch complications on Apple Watch. They display your app’s most relevant, glanceable content in highly visible contexts and let people quickly access your app for more details.\n\nWidgets and watch complications use WidgetKit and SwiftUI views, enabling you to:\n\n- Update your existing widgets’ code to support accessory widgets.\n- Offer WidgetKit complications for your watchOS app, replace ClockKit complications, and share more code between your iOS and watchOS apps.\n- Create watch complications and Lock Screen widgets simultaneously.\n- Add support for iOS or watchOS to your app — in addition to platforms you already support — and offer widgets or complications.\n\nYour path to creating accessory widgets and WidgetKit complications depends on your project.

This allows you to create a shared code base and reduces the need for costly code changes later in the app development process.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Open Xcode and create a new project.\n2. Choose the watchOS app template and select Watch App with New Companion iOS App in the “Choose options for your new project” sheet.\n3. Add a new watchOS widget extension target to your project.\n4. Add a new iOS widget extension target to your project.\n5. Add code for your iOS and watchOS apps, and create iOS widgets — including for the Lock Screen — and watchOS complications simultaneously using SwiftUI views and WidgetKit.\n\nTo learn more about creating widgets and building apps with SwiftUI, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Creating-a-Widget-Extension] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI].
