Note the usage of the `#if os(watchOS)` macro to make sure you declare the correct supported widget families for each platform.\n\n```swift\npublic var body: some WidgetConfiguration {\n    makeWidgetConfiguration()\n        .configurationDisplayName(\"Ranger Detail\")\n        .description(\"See your favorite ranger.\")\n#if os(watchOS)\n        .supportedFamilies([.accessoryCircular,\n                            .accessoryRectangular, .accessoryInline])\n#else\n        .supportedFamilies([.accessoryCircular,\n                            .accessoryRectangular, .accessoryInline,\n                            .systemSmall, .systemMedium, .systemLarge])\n#endif\n}\n```\n\n### Update SwiftUI views to support additional sizes\n\nAfter you’ve declared support for additional widget sizes in your [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Widget], update the views of your widget to support the additional family sizes. In your view code:\n\n1. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/widgetFamily] environment variable to detect different widget families.\n2. Construct the view for each size and include code to handle appearances like vibrant and Dark Mode, as applicable.
