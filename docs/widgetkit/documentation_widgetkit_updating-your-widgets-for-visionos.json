  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro, people add widgets from your visionOS or compatible iPhone and iPad app to a room and permanently pin them to horizontal or vertical surfaces.\n\nWidgets in visionOS work like widgets on other platforms, they:\n\nvisionOS supports all system family widget sizes, from [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/systemSmall] to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/systemExtraLarge] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/systemExtraLargePortrait]. However, supporting extra-large widgets in visionOS depends on whether your app is a visionOS app or a compatible iOS or iPadOS app:\n\nIf your iPhone or iPad app already includes widgets and you enable visionOS compatibility mode, they automatically adopt new spatial and visual treatments for visionOS. However, widgets in visionOS are three-dimensional objects, and have additional capabilities that help them feel at home in a person’s surroundings, keeping information from your app ambient, relevant, and close by.\n\nFor design guidance, refer to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/components\/system-experiences\/widgets].\n\n### Support recessed and elevated mounting styles\n\nPeople add widgets to a room and pin them to a surface. By default, widgets in visionOS sit directly on top of horizontal and vertical surfaces, taking on an elevated look. On horizontal surfaces, widgets always appear with this look. Additionally, widgets can appear recessed, directly embedded into a vertical surface like a wall. If one of these styles isn’t a good fit for your widget, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WidgetConfiguration\/supportedMountingStyles(_:)] view modifier to specify the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetMountingStyle] your visionOS or iOS and iPadOS widget supports:\n\nFor example, a widget might use a photo to create the illusion of a window into another part of the world. This widget would rely on a sense of depth and alignment that doesn’t make sense on a horizontal surface, and does not support the `elevated` mounting style as shown in the following example:\n\n### Support visionOS rendering styles and extra large widgets\n\nBy default, widgets in visionOS appear under a glass texture. For widgets that your visionOS app offers, choose between the default glass texture or an alternative paper texture that gives the widget a poster-like look. To specify your widget’s texture, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WidgetConfiguration\/widgetTexture(_:)] view modifier and choose between [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetTexture\/glass] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetTexture\/paper].\n\nEspecially if your widgets uses a poster-like look, consider offering a [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/systemExtraLargePortrait] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/systemExtraLarge] widget by including it in the array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WidgetConfiguration\/supportedFamilies(_:)] as shown in the following example:\n\n### Support full color and accented rendering modes\n\nBy default, widgets in visionOS appear in [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetRenderingMode\/fullColor], but people can also customize their widgets with a color theme that renders them in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetRenderingMode\/accented] mode, removing the background, and replacing it with a solid color that complements the selected color theme. Supporting the accented rendering mode in visionOS works the same as on other platforms. For more information , refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Preparing-widgets-for-additional-contexts-and-appearances] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/optimizing-your-widget-for-accented-rendering-mode-and-liquid-glass].\n\n### Add proximity awareness to your widget\n\nWhile widgets in visionOS share a lot of similarities with widgets on other platforms, a key difference is the distance between a person and the widgets. People might look at your widget from a close distance or from further away. For example, someone might place a small widget on a desk and view it while sitting at the desk or from across the room. Widgets in visionOS behave like physical objects, appearing smaller as the distance between them and the person increases.\n\nTo make sure your widget remains glanceable, respond to a person’s proximity and update its layout accordingly:\n\nWhen a person’s distance to a widget changes to above or below the threshold for a simplified layout, the system animates the layout changes, similar to how it animates data changes between timeline entries.\n\nThis example shows how a view might respond to the level of detail environment variable by adjusting the text size:",

The extra-large widget appears in a portrait orientation, similar to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/systemExtraLargePortrait] widget of a visionOS app.\n\nIf your iPhone or iPad app already includes widgets and you enable visionOS compatibility mode, they automatically adopt new spatial and visual treatments for visionOS.

Widgets in visionOS behave like physical objects, appearing smaller as the distance between them and the person increases.\n\nTo make sure your widget remains glanceable, respond to a person’s proximity and update its layout accordingly:\n\n1. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/levelOfDetail] environment variable to detect a person’s proximity.\n2. Update your views to display a [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/LevelOfDetail\/default] level of detail when a person is close to the widget.\n3. Display a [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/LevelOfDetail\/simplified] layout with fewer, larger elements that ensures the widget remains legible from a distance.\n\nWhen a person’s distance to a widget changes to above or below the threshold for a simplified layout, the system animates the layout changes, similar to how it animates data changes between timeline entries.\n\nThis example shows how a view might respond to the level of detail environment variable by adjusting the text size:\n\n```swift\nstruct TotalCaffeineView: View {\n    @Environment(\\.levelOfDetail) var levelOfDetail\n    \n    \/\/ ...\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Text(\"Total Caffeine\")\n                .font(.caption)\n            Text(totalCaffeine.formatted())\n                .font(caffeineFont)\n       }\n    }\n\n    var caffeineFont: Font {\n        if levelOfDetail == .simplified {\n            .largeTitle\n        } else {\n            .title\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## visionOS widgets\n\n- **widgetTexture(_:)**: Specifies the widget texture for this widget.\n- **WidgetTexture**: Values that define the texture of the widget’s coating layer.\n- **supportedMountingStyles(_:)**: Specifies the mounting style for this widget.\n- **WidgetMountingStyle**: Values that define the widget’s supported mounting style.\n- **LevelOfDetail**: The level of detail the view is recommended to have.\n\n",
