  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWith Xcode previews, you can make changes to your app’s code and see the results quickly in the preview canvas. Using the `#Preview` macros for widgets, you can preview widgets and Live Activities. The macros allow you to provide timeline entries and content states and click through timeline updates and content changes. As a result, Xcode previews help you quickly and iteratively develop, review, and fine-tune functionality and animations.\n\nFor general information about Xcode previews, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/previewing-your-apps-interface-in-xcode].\n\n### Provide timeline entries to widget previews\n\nWith Xcode previews, you can preview each widget for context and appearance to adjust your widget layouts as needed and iteratively refine their appearance. For example, create a preview for you [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/systemSmall] widget and view it on the preview canvas in light mode, dark mode, in StandBy, in NightMode, and on the iPad Lock Screen.\n\nUsing one of the `#Preview` macros, provide Xcode with the widget and its widget families:\n\nNote that you can create a timeline provider to supply the preview with timeline entries, or create a new timeline with entries specific to the widget. For either option, Xcode creates a preview for each timeline entry and shows transitions for each data update when you navigate from entry to entry in the preview canvas. When you provide a `timelineProvider`, you can easily look for issues as your widget updates and identify bugs and things to polish as data changes.\n\nIn some cases, you might need to fix an animation that occurs later in the timeline. Creating a specific timeline is especially useful because it can help you fix the issue faster by focusing on a specific transition between two timeline entries. For example, you might supply the preview with a timeline provider that has 10 entries and identify an optimization for the transition from entry 9 to 10. To focus on optimizing this specific transition without going through entries 1 to 8, you create a preview with a `timeline` specific to this case that only contains entries 9 and 10.\n\nThe following example shows a preview for the medium system family widget of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/emoji-rangers-supporting-live-activities-interactivity-and-animations] sample code project that uses a timeline with two entries.\n\n### Create previews for your Live Activities\n\nPreviewing Live Activities with Xcode works similar to previewing widgets. The only notable difference is that ActivityKit doesn’t use timelines to update your Live Activities. As a result, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Preview(_:as:using:widget:contentStates:)] macro for Live Activities let you provide `contentStates` to preview content updates for your Live Activity previews.",
