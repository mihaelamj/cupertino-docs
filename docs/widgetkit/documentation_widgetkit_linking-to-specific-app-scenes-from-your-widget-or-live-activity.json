  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nPeople interact with a widget or Live Activity to launch a scene in the corresponding app with matching content and functionality. For example, when people click or tap a Stocks widget, the Stocks app opens to a page that displays information about that stock price.\n\nWhen you create widgets and Live Activities, think about how people interact with them. Make sure interactions launch the scene in your app that fits the widget’s content or the Live Activity.\n\n### Launch a specific screen in your app\n\nBy default, tapping or clicking your widget or Live Activity opens its corresponding app. To provide a good experience and not make people navigate to get to the right place in your app, open the app at a scene that matches the content of the widget or Live Activity. To open a specific screen in your app, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/widgetURL(_:)] modifier to a view in the view hierarchy of your widget or Live Activity.\n\nFor example, the following code snippet from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/emoji-rangers-supporting-live-activities-interactivity-and-animations] sample code project shows how the small widget uses `widgetURL(_:)` to allow people to open the app and show a character’s detail information:\n\nFor widgets with enough space for more than one interaction target — [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/accessoryRectangular], [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetFamily\/systemSmall], and larger system family sizes — add one or more [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Link] controls to your view hierarchy. You can use one `widgetURL` and additional `Link` controls. If an interaction targets a `Link` control, the system uses the URL in that control. For interactions anywhere else in the widget, the system uses the URL you specify in the `widgetURL(_:)` view modifier.\n\nFor example, the leaderboard widget of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/emoji-rangers-supporting-live-activities-interactivity-and-animations] app displays a list of characters. Each item in the list uses a `Link` control to launch the scene in the app for the specific character that the item represents.\n\n### Detect the originating widget by accessing the user activity object\n\nIf a widget doesn’t specify a deep link URL with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/widgetURL(_:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Link] and a person interacts with it, the system opens the containing app and passes an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:)], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplicationDelegate\/application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)]. The user activity’s `userInfo` dictionary contains details about the widget the person interacted with. Use the keys in [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/WidgetCenter\/UserInfoKey] to access these values from Swift code. To access the `userInfo` values from Objective-C, use the keys `WGWidgetUserInfoKeyKind` and `WGWidgetUserInfoKeyFamily` instead. Then, update your app’s interface to match the widget so people don’t have to navigate to the right place in your app.\n\n### Review linking behavior in CarPlay\n\nIn CarPlay, linking from your widget to your app works differently to match the specific context of using your app while using your car. For more information about supporting CarPlay, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/adding-standby-and-carplay-support-to-your-widget].",
