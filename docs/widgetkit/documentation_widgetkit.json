  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUsing WidgetKit, you can make your app’s content available in contexts outside the app and extend its reach by building an ecosystem of glanceable, up-to-date experiences.\n\n\n\nThe ecosystem that WidgetKit enables consists of:\n\n### Develop glanceable features iteratively\n\nWidgetKit enables features across iPad, iPhone, the Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro, but only in a way that best fits a person’s device and personal needs. For example, WidgetKit powers widgets on all platforms in various sizes. It also powers Live Activities and controls, features that aren’t available on Apple Vision Pro.\n\nEven though not every feature that WidgetKit powers is available on every platform or device, widgets, Live Activities, controls, and watch complications share technology and design similarities. This makes it easy to develop features in tandem and to expand usage across contexts.\n\nUse an iterative approach and start with support for one feature or select sizes of widgets — for example, start with a small widget as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Creating-a-Widget-Extension], but plan and design additional sizes and features across platforms from the beginning. Then allow people to view your content in as many contexts as possible.\n\nFor more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Developing-a-WidgetKit-strategy].\n\n### Understand interactivity and personalization\n\nThe WidgetKit ecosystem enables people to view your app content in new contexts and offers specific interactions with your app when and where they need it:\n\nIn addition to offering relevant information and specific interactivity at a glance, people use widgets, watch complications, Live Activities, and controls to personalize their devices:\n\n### Update content with timelines and push notifications\n\nWidgets and watch complications use a special mechanism to update their content: You create a timeline of data updates and hand it to WidgetKit. WidgetKit then makes sure the widget or complication updates its content in an energy-efficient way. For more information on timelines, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Keeping-a-Widget-Up-To-Date]. Additionally, widgets can receive updates by using the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and remote push notifications.\n\nLive Activities don’t use timelines to update their content. Instead, they use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ActivityKit] and ActivityKit push notifications you send with APNs. For more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ActivityKit].\n\nControls don’t use timelines to update their content. Instead, your controls update their content when someone uses them, the app reloads them, or the system receives a remote push notification from APNs.\n\n### Create a focused, glanceable design\n\nWidgets, watch complications, Live Activities, and controls are small and require a focused, glanceable design. For design guidance, refer to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/components\/system-experiences\/widgets], [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/components\/system-experiences\/complications], [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/components\/system-experiences\/live-activities], and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/controls].",

Then allow people to view your content in as many contexts as possible.\n\nFor more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Developing-a-WidgetKit-strategy].\n\n### Understand interactivity and personalization\n\nThe WidgetKit ecosystem enables people to view your app content in new contexts and offers specific interactions with your app when and where they need it:\n\n- People tap a widget, watch complication, or Live Activity to launch the corresponding app or the app’s scene with matching information or functionality. For example, tapping an Emoji Ranger widget or watch complication launches the scene in the app that matches the displayed hero. For more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Linking-to-specific-app-scenes-from-your-widget-or-Live-Activity].\n- People use buttons and toggles in widgets, controls, and Live Activities to interact with your app without launching it. For example, the large widget of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/emoji-rangers-supporting-live-activities-interactivity-and-animations] sample code project includes a button that people tap to give the healing capability of their hero a temporary boost.\n\nIn addition to offering relevant information and specific interactivity at a glance, people use widgets, watch complications, Live Activities, and controls to personalize their devices:\n\n- People configure widgets and watch complications to display details specific to their needs. For example, a widget of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/emoji-rangers-supporting-live-activities-interactivity-and-animations] sample code project allows people to configure the hero that appears on the widget.\n- People arrange widgets and watch complications in the way that works best for them. When they stack widgets and enable Smart Rotate on iPhone or iPad, WidgetKit automatically rotates the most relevant widget to the top, making sure people see the most important details at the right time. On Apple Watch, the Smart Stack displays widgets based on contextual relevance, and people pin a favorite widget to a fixed position in the Smart Stack.\n\n### Update content with timelines and push notifications\n\nWidgets and watch complications use a special mechanism to update their content: You create a timeline of data updates and hand it to WidgetKit. WidgetKit then makes sure the widget or complication updates its content in an energy-efficient way. For more information on timelines, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.WidgetKit\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Keeping-a-Widget-Up-To-Date]. Additionally, widgets can receive updates by using the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and remote push notifications.\n\nLive Activities don’t use timelines to update their content.

For more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ActivityKit].\n\nControls don’t use timelines to update their content. Instead, your controls update their content when someone uses them, the app reloads them, or the system receives a remote push notification from APNs.\n\n### Create a focused, glanceable design\n\nWidgets, watch complications, Live Activities, and controls are small and require a focused, glanceable design.
