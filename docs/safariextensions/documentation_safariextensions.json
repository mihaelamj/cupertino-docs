These capabilities enhance the tools you use, the tasks you can accomplish, and the data you can access in your browser. A Safari app extension is uniquely useful because it can communicate with a native app. Sharing data between an app and Safari lets you integrate app content into Safari or send web data back to the app, enabling a unified experience for a web version and a native version of an app.\n\n\n\n\n\nSafari app extensions use a combination of JavaScript, CSS, and native code written in Objective-C or Swift. Because you build Safari app extensions on the standard app extension model, you get many native app benefits:\n\n- You bundle Safari app extensions inside your app and distribute them through the App Store. You can distribute a Safari app extension with a Mac app or a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/mac-catalyst] app.\n- Because you distribute your app and your Safari app extension together, you minimize the chances of installing mismatched versions.\n- Your Safari app extension can securely communicate with your app using shared resources.\n\nTo become familiar with app extension concepts, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-extensions\/]. If you’re interested in deploying an extension you build for Chrome, Firefox, or Edge in Safari, or creating an extension that works in Safari and other browsers, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/safari-web-extensions].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Building a Safari app extension**: Add, build, and enable a Safari app extension.\n- **Converting a legacy Safari extension to a Safari app extension**: Convert a legacy Safari extension to a Safari app extension, automatically with keys or manually.\n- **Troubleshooting your Safari app extension**: Debug your Safari app extension with these techniques.\n\n## Injected style sheets and scripts\n\n- **Using injected style sheets and scripts**: Learn how you can affect the appearance or behavior of a webpage by using injected style sheets and scripts.\n- **Injecting a script into a webpage**: Inject a script that you write for a Safari app extension into a webpage.\n- **Injecting CSS style sheets into a webpage**: Add to or override styles by injecting CSS style sheets into webpages.\n- **Passing messages between Safari app extensions and injected scripts**: Communicate between your Safari app extension and injected scripts.\n- **SFSafariExtensionHandler**: A base class that you subclass to handle events in your Safari app extension.\n- **SFSafariExtensionManager**: A class that your app uses to find out the current state of a Safari app extension.\n- **SFSafariExtensionState**: The state of a Safari app extension.\n- **SFSafariPageProperties**: An object that captures information about a webpage.\n- **SFSafariExtensionHandling**: A protocol for implementing event handling in a Safari app extension.\n- **SFExtensionProfileKey**: A string the system uses as a key in a user info dictionary to identify a profile identifier.\n\n## Information property list keys\n\n- **Safari app extension information property list keys**: Specify keys in your information property list file that provide information about your Safari app extension, UI, and permissions to the operating system.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Safari Extensions JS**: Communicate with your native extension from your Safari app extension, and support delivery of push notifications in Safari.\n- **Safari web extensions**: Create web extensions that work in Safari and other browsers.\n\n## Safari app extensions\n\n- **SFSafariExtension**: A proxy for the Safari extension.\n- **SFSafariApplication**: A proxy for the Safari app.\n- **SFSafariWindow**: A proxy for a Safari window.\n- **SFSafariPage**: A proxy for a Safari webpage.\n- **SFSafariTab**: A proxy for a tab in a Safari window.\n\n",
