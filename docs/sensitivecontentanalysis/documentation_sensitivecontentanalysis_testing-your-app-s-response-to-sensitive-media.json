  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYou can test your app’s response to nudity in media by analyzing a special QR code. When SensitiveContentAnalysis encounters media that contains the code, the framework flags the media as sensitive. Testing with the QR code enables you to experience your app’s intervention workflow without storing or displaying content that contains nudity. You can use this testing process in an open development environment, or while demonstrating the app to an audience. To enable the framework to recognize the test QR code as sensitive, download and install a special profile on the development device.\n\n### Download the QR code\n\nAlthough the following image contains no nudity, the framework recognizes it as sensitive content. By returning [doc:\/\/com.apple.SensitiveContentAnalysis\/documentation\/SensitiveContentAnalysis\/SCSensitivityAnalysis\/isSensitive] = `true`, the analyzer ([doc:\/\/com.apple.SensitiveContentAnalysis\/documentation\/SensitiveContentAnalysis\/SCSensitivityAnalyzer]) returns a false positive for this QR code for the special purpose of testing.\n\n\n\nClick or tap to download [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/sample-code\/web\/qr-sca.jpg]. Use [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/sample-code\/web\/qr-sca.mov] to generate a false positive with video.\n\n### Install the test profile\n\nThe framework considers the test QR code sensitive only if the development device contains a special profile. Apple provides a special profile specifically for this purpose:\n\n### Embed the test QR code in another image or video\n\nYou can include the QR code in other images or videos, and SensitiveContentAnalysis recognizes the host media as sensitive.

In a video file, position the QR code in the first frame.\n\n### Test the media and generate a false positive\n\nIn your app, check the test media by calling one of the `analyze` functions. For example, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.SensitiveContentAnalysis\/documentation\/SensitiveContentAnalysis\/SCSensitivityAnalyzer\/analyzeImage(_:completionHandler:)] and pass in the image as an argument. Or, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.SensitiveContentAnalysis\/documentation\/SensitiveContentAnalysis\/SCSensitivityAnalyzer\/analyzeVideoFile:completionHandler:] and pass in the test video as an argument.
