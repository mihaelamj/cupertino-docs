In iOS and macOS, the Sensitive Content Warning user preference or Communication Safety parental control in Screen Time offer people the option to indicate their desire to guard against unexpected or unwanted exposure to images that contain nudity. Provide people with the experience they request in these settings by using SensitiveContentAnalysis to check for sensitive content before displaying it.\n\nConsider situations in which your app acquires externally-sourced images or video, and use this framework to check if the media is sensitive. For example, a messaging app checks each image it receives from a contact. A classroom app evaluates uploads from personal devices to a shared location for classwork submission or other classroom activities. A video-conferencing app analyzes the video streams of all perticipants, live on a call.\n\n\n\n### Intervene when content is sensitive\n\nIf the framework determines that some media contains sensitive content, call the user’s attention to the issue and avoid displaying the media until the user decides what to do.
