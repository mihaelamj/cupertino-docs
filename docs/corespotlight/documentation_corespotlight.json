Learn more about [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/AppSearch\/Activities.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40016308-CH6-SW1].\n- Use web markup to index content on your web server in Apple’s server-side index, which makes the data available to all iOS users in Spotlight and Safari search results. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/AppSearch\/WebContent.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40016308-CH8-SW1] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/AppSearch\/index.html].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Adding your app’s content to Spotlight indexes**: Create a description for your app’s content and add it to a Spotlight index to make it searchable.\n- **Enabling Apple Intelligence summarization and prioritization**: Summarize and prioritize app content using Spotlight extensions.\n\n## Searchable items\n\n- **CSSearchableItem**: The details of your app-specific content that someone might search for on their devices.\n- **CSSearchableItemAttributeSet**: The detailed metadata for a searchable item.\n- **CSCustomAttributeKey**: A key associated with a custom attribute for a searchable item.\n- **CSLocalizedString**: An object that displays localized text in search results related to your app.\n- **CSPerson**: An object that represents a person in the context of search results.\n\n## Indexes\n\n- **CSSearchableIndex**: An on-device index for your app’s searchable content.\n- **CSSearchableIndexDelegate**: A protocol that defines methods a delegate object or app extension uses to handle communication from the on-device index.\n\n## Spotlight app extensions\n\n- **Regenerating your app’s indexes on demand**: Create an app extension to maintain your app’s indexes and regenerate them as needed.\n- **CSIndexExtensionRequestHandler**: An interface that implements an index-maintenance app extension.\n- **CSImportExtension**: An object that provides searchable attributes for file types that the app supports.\n\n## Queries\n\n- **Building a search interface for your app**: Add a search interface to your app to execute Spotlight queries and offer suggested text completions.\n- **Searching for information in your app**: Search for app-specific content and refine search results using predicates and filters.\n- **CSUserQuery**: A type you use to initiate searches from your interface and offer suggested text completions.\n- **CSUserQueryContext**: The configuration details to apply to a user query.\n- **CSSearchQuery**: A type you use to programmatically search the indexed app content.\n- **CSSearchQueryContext**: The behavior configuration to use for a search query.\n- **CSSuggestion**: The kind of suggestion to use in a query.\n\n## Errors\n\n- **CSIndexError**: Index errors returned by Core Spotlight.\n- **CSSearchQueryError**: Search query errors returned by Core Spotlight.\n- **CSIndex Errors**: Index error codes and error domain.\n- **CSSearchQuery Errors**: Search query error codes and error domain.\n\n## Version\n\n- **CoreSpotlightAPIVersion**: The API version number for Core Spotlight.\n\n",
