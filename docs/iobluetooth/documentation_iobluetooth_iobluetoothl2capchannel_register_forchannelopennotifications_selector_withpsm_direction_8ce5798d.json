To unregister the notification, call -unregister on the resulting IOBluetoothUserNotification object. If an error is encountered creating the notification, nil is returned. The returned IOBluetoothUserNotification will be valid for as long as the notification is registered. It is not necessary to retain the result. Once -unregister is called on it, it will no longer be valid.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe given selector will be called on the target object whenever an L2CAP channel with the given attributes is opened. The selector should accept two arguments. The first is the user notification object. The second is the IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel that was opened.",
