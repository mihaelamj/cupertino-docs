  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA client won’t create IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel objects directly. Instead, the IOBluetoothDevice’s L2CAP channel open API is responsible for opening a new L2CAP channel and returning an IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel instance representing that newly opened channel. Additionally, the IOBluetooth notification system will send notifications when new L2CAP channels are open (if requested).\n\nAfter a new L2CAP channel is opened, the L2CAP configuration process will not be completed until an incoming data listener is registered with the IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel object. The reason for this is to due to the limited buffering done of incoming L2CAP data. This way, we avoid the situation where incoming data is received before the client is ready for it. Once a client is done with an IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel that it opened, it should call -closeChannel. Additionally, if the client does not intend to use the connection to the remote device any further, it should call -closeConnection on the IOBluetoothDevice object.",
