The returned IOBluetoothUserNotification object will be valid for as long as the notification is registered. It is not necessary to retain the result. Once -unregister is called on it, it will no longer be valid.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe given selector will be called on the target observer whenever any device connection is made. The selector should accept two arguments. The first is the user notification object. The second is the device that was connected.",
