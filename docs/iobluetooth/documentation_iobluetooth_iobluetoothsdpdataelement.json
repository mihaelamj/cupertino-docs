At its simplest, a data element is made up of three parts: the type descriptor, the size (from which the size descriptor is generated) and the actual value. To provide a complete representation of a data element, an NSDictionary with three entries can be used. Each of the three entries has a key\/value pair representing one of the three attributes of a data element. The first key\/value pair has a key ‘DataElementType’ that contains a number value with the actual type descriptor for the data element. The second pair has a key ‘DataElementSize’ that contains the actual size of the element in bytes. The size descriptor will be calculated based on the size and type of the element.
