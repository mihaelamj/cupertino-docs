Returns only once the channel is open or failed to open.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nfunc openRFCOMMChannelSync(_ rfcommChannel: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<IOBluetoothRFCOMMChannel?>!, withChannelID channelID: BluetoothRFCOMMChannelID, delegate channelDelegate: Any!) -> IOReturn\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **rfcommChannel**: A pointer to an IOBluetoothRFCOMMChannel object to receive the RFCOMM channel requested to be opened. The rfcommChannel pointer will only be set if kIOReturnSuccess is returned.\n- **channelID**: The RFCOMM channel ID for the new channel.\n- **channelDelegate**: The object that will play the role of delegate for the channel. A channel delegate is the object the rfcomm uses as target for data and events. The developer will implement only the the methods he\/she is interested in. A list of the possible methods is at the end of the file “IOBluetoothRFCOMMChannel.h” in the definition of the protocol IOBluetoothRFCOMMChannelDelegate.\n\n## Return Value\n\nReturns kIOReturnSuccess if the open process was successfully started (or if an existing RFCOMM channel was found).
