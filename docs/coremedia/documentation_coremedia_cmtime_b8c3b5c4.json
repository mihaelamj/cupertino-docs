If the operands have different timescales, the timescale of the result is the least common multiple of the operands’ timescales. If that value is greater than [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/kCMTimeMaxTimescale], the system sets the timescale to [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/kCMTimeMaxTimescale] and uses the default rounding method to convert the result to this timescale.\n\nIf the value of the result overflows, the system repeatedly halves its timescale until it no longer overflows, and uses the default rounding to convert the result to this timescale. If the result’s value still overflows when its timescale is `1`, the system sets the result’s timescale to positive or negative infinity, depending on the direction of the overflow. If any rounding occurs, or if either operand has its [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMTimeFlags\/hasBeenRounded] flag set, the system sets the result’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMTimeFlags\/hasBeenRounded] flag.\n\nIf either of the operands is [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMTime\/invalid], the result is [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMTime\/invalid].\n\nIf the operands are valid, but one is infinite, the result is infinite.

If both have the same nonzero epoch, the result is epoch zero. You can’t add or subtract times that have different epochs, because the epoch length is unknown.
