Pass `kCFAllocatorDefault` to use the default allocator.\n- **originalSBuf**: `CMSampleBuffer` containing the original samples.\n- **numSampleTimingEntries**: Number of entries in `sampleTimingArray`. Must be 0, 1, or the number of samples in `originalSBuf`.\n- **sampleTimingArray**: Array of `CMSampleTimingInfo` structs, one struct per sample. If all samples have the same duration and are in presentation order, you can pass a single `CMSampleTimingInfo` struct with duration set to the duration of one sample, `presentationTimeStamp` set to the presentation time of the numerically earliest sample, and `decodeTimeStamp` set to `kCMTimeInvalid`. Behavior is undefined if samples in a `CMSampleBuffer` (or even in multiple buffers in the same stream) have the same `presentationTimeStamp`. Can be `NULL`.\n- **sampleBufferOut**: On output, points to the newly created copy of `CMSampleBuffer`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA result code. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/sample-buffer-errors].\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis emulates `CMSampleBufferCreateCopy`, but changes the timing. The array parameters, `sampleTimingArray`, should have only one element if that same element applies to all samples.\n\nAll parameters are copied; on return, the caller can release them, free them, or reuse them. Any `outputPresentationTimestamp` that has been set on the original buffer isn’t copied because it’s no longer relevant. On return, the caller owns the returned `CMSampleBuffer`, and must release it when done with it.\n\n## Copying Sample Buffers\n\n- **CMSampleBufferCreateCopy(allocator:sampleBuffer:sampleBufferOut:)**: Creates a copy of a sample buffer.\n- **CMSampleBufferCopySampleBufferForRange(allocator:sampleBuffer:sampleRange:sampleBufferOut:)**: Creates a sample buffer that contains a range of samples from an existing sample buffer.\n\n",
