The buffers can be of any Core Foundation-based type (`CFTypeRef`), but must have a concept of duration. When you create a buffer queue, you pass a set of callbacks, one of which is a required callback that returns the duration of the Core Foundation-based buffer object.

For example, you can test for emptiness ([doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMBufferQueueCreate(allocator:capacity:callbacks:queueOut:)]), current queue duration (`Inspecting Buffer Queues`), and end-of-data status ([doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMBufferQueueContainsEndOfData(_:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMBufferQueueIsAtEndOfData(_:)]).\n\nYou can install trigger callbacks by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMBufferQueueInstallTriggerHandler(_:_:_:_:_:)] function to get notifications of various queue state transitions, such as when the duration becomes less than a second.

The system invokes trigger callbacks synchronously on the thread that called the API.\n\nYou can’t modify the state of the queue from within a trigger callback. The operation fails, returning a [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremedia\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/kCMBufferQueueError_CannotModifyQueueFromTriggerCallback] error. Attempting to enqueue a buffer when the queue is full, or dequeue from an empty queue, immediately returns an error (or a `NULL` buffer).\n\nInstall triggers to observe the queue’s fullness rather
