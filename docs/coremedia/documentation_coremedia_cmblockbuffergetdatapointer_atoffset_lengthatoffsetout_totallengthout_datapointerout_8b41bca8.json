A pointer into a memory block is returned which corresponds to the offset within the `CMBlockBuffer`.  If `lengthAtOffset` is non `NULL`, the number of bytes addressable at the pointer is returned. This length-at-offset may be smaller than the number of bytes actually available starting at the offset if the `dataLength` of the `CMBlockBuffer` is covered by multiple memory blocks (a noncontiguous `CMBlockBuffer`). The caller can compare (`offset`+`lengthAtOffset`) with `totalLength` to determine whether the entire `CMBlockBuffer` has been referenced and whether it is possible to access the `CMBlockBuffer`’s data with a contiguous reference. The data pointer returned will remain valid as long as the original `CMBlockBuffer` is referenced - once the `CMBlockBuffer` is released for the last time, any pointers                into it will be invalid.",

Must not be `NULL`\n- **offset**: Offset within the buffer’s offset range.\n- **lengthAtOffsetOut**: On return, contains the amount of data available at the specified offset. May be `NULL`.\n- **totalLengthOut**: On return, contains the block buffer’s total data length (from offset 0). May be `NULL`.\n- **dataPointerOut**: On return, contains a pointer to the data byte at the specified offset; `lengthAtOffset` bytes are available at this address. May be `NULL`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nReturns `kCMBlockBufferNoErr` if data was accessible at the specified offset within the given `CMBlockBuffer`.
