  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo support Live Activities in your app, you must provide layouts for each Live Activity presentation. Because Live Activities appear automatically across a person’s devices, views you use for your Live Activities automatically adapt to provide a default layout. To offer the best user experience and make the most of the available space, create reusable, custom views that automatically adapt for each Live Activity presentation.\n\n### Use supplemental activity families\n\nThe different presentations are key to creating layouts for your Live Activities. By requiring you to support each presentation, the system can render your Live Activity across devices without you having to add code for each device:\n\nTo offer a great experience in StandBy, on Apple Watch, and in CarPlay, provide flexible custom views to keep people informed about the state of a Live Activity and offer interactivity:\n\nThe following example shows how an app might configure a Live Activity that provides different view layouts for small and medium activity families:\n\nIn your view code, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/activityFamily] environment value to detect the activity family and change the Live Activity layout accordingly.\n\nThe following example shows how a view might respond to different activity families:\n\nFor more information about reusing custom views across widgets and Live Activities, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Creating-views-for-widgets-Live-Activities-and-watch-complications].\n\n### Set custom content margins\n\nLimiting the content you display is key to offering glanceable, easy-to-read Live Activities. Aim to use the system’s default content margins for your Live Activities and only show content that’s relevant to the person viewing it. However, you may want to change the system’s default content margin to display more content or provide a custom user interface that matches your app. To set custom content margins, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/DynamicIsland\/contentMargins(_:_:for:)].  The following example results in a margin of eight points for the trailing edge of an expanded Live Activity.\n\nIf you repeatedly use the `contentMargins(_:_:for:)` modifier, the system uses the innermost specified values for a mode.\n\n### Use custom colors\n\nLive Activities in the Dynamic Island use a black background color with white text. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/DynamicIsland\/keylineTint(_:)] modifier to apply a subtle tint color to the border of the Dynamic Island when the device is in Dark Mode and change text color as needed.\n\nBy default, the Lock Screen presentation — including the banner that appears on devices that don’t support the Dynamic island — uses a solid white background color in Light Mode and a solid black background color in Dark Mode. To set a custom background color for the Lock Screen presentation, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/activityBackgroundTint(_:)] modifier. Be sure to choose a color that works well in both Dark or Light Mode or use different background colors that best fit each appearance. To set the translucency of the custom background color, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Color\/opacity(_:)] view modifier or specify an opaque background color.\n\nIf you choose a custom background color for the Lock Screen presentation, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/activitySystemActionForegroundColor(_:)] view modifier to customize the text color of the auxiliary button that allows people to end the Live Activity on the Lock Screen.",

Because Live Activities appear automatically across a person’s devices, views you use for your Live Activities automatically adapt to provide a default layout. To offer the best user experience and make the most of the available space, create reusable, custom views that automatically adapt for each Live Activity presentation.\n\n### Use supplemental activity families\n\nThe different presentations are key to creating layouts for your Live Activities. By requiring you to support each presentation, the system can render your Live Activity across devices without you having to add code for each device:\n\n- In StandBy, the system expands the Lock Screen presentation to fill the whole screen.\n- On Apple Watch, Live Activities automatically appear in the Smart Stack and as alerts using the compact presentation.\n- In CarPlay, Live Activities automatically appear on the Home Screen using the compact presentation.\n\nTo offer a great experience in StandBy, on Apple Watch, and in CarPlay, provide flexible custom views to keep people informed about the state of a Live Activity and offer interactivity:\n\n- To tell the system that you provide a custom layout on Apple Watch and in CarPlay, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/ActivityFamily\/small]  to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WidgetConfiguration\/supplementalActivityFamilies(_:)]  view modifier.\n- To tell the system that your Live Activity adapts its layout on the Lock Screen of iPhone and iPad, for example in StandBy, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/ActivityFamily\/medium] to the `supplementalActivityFamilies(_:)`  view modifier.\n\nThe following example shows how an app might configure a Live Activity that provides different view layouts for small and medium activity families:\n\n```swift\nstruct AdventureActivityConfiguration: Widget {\n    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {\n        ActivityConfiguration(for: AdventureAttributes.self) { context in\n            \/\/ Create the presentation that appears on the Lock Screen and as a\n            \/\/ banner on the Home Screen of devices that don't support the\n            \/\/ Dynamic Island.\n            \/\/ ...\n        } dynamicIsland: { context in\n            \/\/ Create the presentations that appear in the Dynamic Island.\n            DynamicIsland {\n                \/\/ Create the expanded presentation.\n                \/\/ ...\n            } compactLeading: {\n                \/\/ Create the compact leading presentation.\n                \/\/ ...\n            } compactTrailing: {\n                \/\/ Create the compact trailing presentation.\n                \/\/ ...\n            } minimal: {\n                \/\/ Create the minimal presentation.\n                \/\/ ...\n            }\n        }\n        ..supplementalActivityFamilies([.small, .medium])\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn your view code, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/activityFamily] environment value to detect the activity family and change the Live Activity layout accordingly.\n\nThe following example shows how a view might respond to different activity families:\n\n```swift\nstruct CustomSupplementalActivityView: View {\n    @Environment(\\.activityFamily) var activityFamily\n    var context: ActivityViewContext<EmojiRangersAttributes>\n    \n    var body: some View {\n        switch activityFamily {\n        case .small:\n            SmallSupplementalView(context: context)\n        case .medium:\n            MediumSupplementalView(context: context)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nFor more information about reusing custom views across widgets and Live Activities, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Creating-views-for-widgets-Live-Activities-and-watch-complications].\n\n### Set custom content margins\n\nLimiting the content you display is key to offering glanceable, easy-to-read Live Activities.
