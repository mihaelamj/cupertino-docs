To allow people to customize how they interact with your widget or Live Activity, to verify VoiceOver works correctly for them, and to help people understand what each interface element represents, add accessibility labels to the SwiftUI views you create for each widget and Live Activity presentation.\n\n### Provide accessibility labels\n\nAdd accessibility labels for each SwiftUI view you use as needed and make sure your accessibility labels fit the widget or Live Activity content. To review API that allows you to add accessible descriptions to SwiftUI views, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Accessible-descriptions].\n\nThe example below shows how the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/emoji-rangers-supporting-live-activities-interactivity-and-animations] app uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/accessibilityLabel(_:)-1d7jv] modifier to add accessibility labels for minimal, compact leading, and compact trailing presentations.\n\nIf you provide a content description for an image you update while a Live Activity is active and the image conveys status information or similar, make sure to also update the accessibility label to match the updated status. For example, if an image indicates a delivery status, make sure the accessibility label changes as the delivery status that the image indicates changes. Similarly, update accessibility labels when a widget updates displayed images or SwiftUI views.
