Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhotometricLight\/generateCubemap(fromLight:)] method to generate a texture, then use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhotometricLight\/lightCubeMap] property to access the texture. In this texture, each texel represents the light’s intensity in the direction from the cube’s center to the texel’s position on the cube.\n- **As spherical harmonics.** Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhotometricLight\/generateSphericalHarmonics(fromLight:)] method to generate a set of spherical harmonic coefficients, and then use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhotometricLight\/sphericalHarmonicsLevel] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhotometricLight\/sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients] properties to access these coefficients. Spherical harmonic coefficients provide a more compact representation of the same information as the cube map texture, so you can use them during shading without the performance cost of a texture lookup.\n\nBoth the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhotometricLight] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLAreaLight] classes can describe lights with interesting shapes—an area light offers a simpler design that can be implemented with better rendering performance, and a photometric light offers design that better models real-world light fixtures at the cost of higher computational complexity.\n\n## Creating a Photometric Light\n\n- **init(iesProfile:)**: Initializes a light from photometry data in the file at the specified URL.\n\n## Interpreting the Light Web as a Cube Texture\n\n- **generateCubemap(fromLight:)**: Generates a cube map texture from the light’s photometry data.\n- **lightCubeMap**: A cube map texture describing the light’s intensity in all directions.\n\n## Interpreting the Light Web as Spherical Harmonics\n\n- **generateSphericalHarmonics(fromLight:)**: Generates spherical harmonics information based on the light’s photometry data.\n- **sphericalHarmonicsCoefficients**: Data containing spherical harmonics coefficients that describe the light’s intensity in all directions.\n- **sphericalHarmonicsLevel**: The number of levels of generated spherical harmonics information.\n\n## Instance Methods\n\n- **generateTexture(_:)**\n\n## Lights\n\n- **MDLLight**: The abstract superclass for objects that describe light sources in a scene.\n- **MDLAreaLight**: A light source that illuminates a 3D scene from an area with a specific shape.\n- **MDLLightProbe**: A light source described in terms of the variations in color and intensity of its illumination in all directions.\n- **MDLLightProbeIrradianceDataSource**: Adopt this protocol to provide information for use in automatic placement of light probes around a scene.\n- **MDLPhysicallyPlausibleLight**: A light source for use in shading models based on real-world physics.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- MDLPhysicallyPlausibleLight\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- MDLNamed\n- NSObjectProtocol\n\n",
