The shape of an area light is a two-dimensional figure in the xy-plane of the light’s local coordinate space, and its illumination is directed in the negative z-axis direction (spreading out from that direction according to the inherited [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhysicallyPlausibleLight\/innerConeAngle] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhysicallyPlausibleLight\/outerConeAngle] properties).\n\nBoth the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLAreaLight] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLPhotometricLight] classes can describe lights with interesting shapes. An area light offers a simpler design that can be implemented with better rendering performance, and a photometric light offers design that better models real-world light fixtures at the cost of higher computational complexity.",
