In addition to describing such light sources, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLightProbe] class provides methods for generating light probe textures based on the contents of a scene and for generating spherical harmonic coefficients from a texture.\n\nA light probe consists of two cube map textures, where each texel represents the color and intensity of light in a particular direction from the cube’s center:\n\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLightProbe\/reflectiveTexture] cube map, also known as an *environment map*, contains a rendering of a scene as viewed from the light probe’s position. A renderer can use this texture to create reflections on surfaces with metallic materials.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLightProbe\/irradianceTexture] cube map contains samples of the total light arriving at the light probe’s position from every direction. A renderer can use this texture to create diffuse lighting effects. You can derive an irradiance map from an environment map with methods on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLTexture] class, or when creating a light probe with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLightProbe\/init(textureSize:forLocation:lightsToConsider:objectsToConsider:reflectiveCubemap:irradianceCubemap:)] method.\n\nUsing cube map textures for light-probe-based rendering offers great visual fidelity, but adversely affects performance due to the cost of texture lookups during rendering.
