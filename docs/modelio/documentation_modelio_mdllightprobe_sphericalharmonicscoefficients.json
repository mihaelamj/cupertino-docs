Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLightProbe\/generateSphericalHarmonics(fromIrradiance:)] method to create spherical harmonics data based on the light probe’s irradiance texture.\n\nThe data is an array of 32-bit floating-point values, containing three noninterleaved data sets corresponding to the red, green, and blue sets of coefficients. The array’s length is determined by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLightProbe\/sphericalHarmonicsLevel] property:\n\nFor example, the code below shows how to access the second coefficient at level 2.",
