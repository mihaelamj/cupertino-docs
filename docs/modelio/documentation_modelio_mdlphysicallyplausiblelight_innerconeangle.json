For example, a cone angle of 22.5 degrees (the default) creates a broad spot light. (The light’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLight\/lightType] value is [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLightType\/spot].) An angle of 90 degrees divides space evenly, illuminating in all directions in front of the light and none behind, and an angle of 180 degrees illuminates in all directions (creating a light whose type is [doc:\/\/com.apple.modelio\/documentation\/ModelIO\/MDLLightType\/point]).",
