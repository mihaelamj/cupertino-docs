For example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Creating-a-Widget-Extension] display your app’s content in specific locations like the iOS Home Screen and Lock screen. System features typically provide a custom workflow for building the associated app extension, but still use this framework to implement support for those features.\n\nIf your app supports the incorporation of content from custom app extensions, adopt this framework and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ExtensionFoundation] framework to support that capability. Adopt `ExtensionKit` in your app extensions and use it to define the views you want to display. In a host app, use this framework to present the interfaces that app extensions provide. This framework also provides a view controller to show enabled and disabled app extensions from your app’s interface.",
