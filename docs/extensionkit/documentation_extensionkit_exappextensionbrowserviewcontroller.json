When you present this view controller, the system displays an out-of-process UI with a list of all app extensions that support your app’s extension points. Someone using your app can use the presented interface to enable or disable extensions selectively. App extensions you include inside your host app’s bundle are enabled by default, but extensions that ship in separate apps are disabled by default.\n\nPresent this view controller modally from your app, or embed the view controller as a child in one of your existing view controller interfaces. For example, you might choose to embed the view controller in a tab of your app’s preferences interface.",
