On macOS, a person can enable and disable extensions from the Settings app. However, [doc:\/\/com.apple.extensionkit\/documentation\/ExtensionKit] also provides a custom interface that you can show directly from your app.\n\nWhen designing your app’s interface, consider the workflow for managing any app extensions. Include UI for enabling and disabling extensions in a readily accessible part of your app. For example, present this information in your app’s settings so that people can get to it at any time.
