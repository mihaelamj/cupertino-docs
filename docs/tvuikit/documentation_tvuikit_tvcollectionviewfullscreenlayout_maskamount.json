Setting the value of the property on the layout updates the `maskAmount` value of all the cells.\n\nThis property can take on a float value between `0` and `1.0`. A value of `0` indicates that the cells are full-screen, and a value of `1.0` indicates that the collection view applies the full mask to its cells.\n\nThe default value of this property is `1.0`.\n\n",
