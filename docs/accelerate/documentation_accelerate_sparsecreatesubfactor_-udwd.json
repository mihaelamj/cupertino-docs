For example, just the `Q` factor from `A=QRP`. The returned object is a wrapper around the orignal factorization, and does not actually perform any extraction (sub-factors are stored in non-standard formats that exploit implicit structure for efficiency, and formation of the sub-factor explicitly can be expensive). It is intended to be used as an argument to `SparseMultiply` and `SparseSolve` functions only.\n\nAs `Factor` is contained in the returned object, its underlying reference count in incremented, and the returned object must hence be destroyed through a call to `SparseCleanup` to prevent a memory leak (however it is safe to call `SparseCleanup` on the original factorization whilst this object is still being used).",
