This function always works in place, that is, the input and the output point to the same memory.\n- **tempBuffer**: A pointer to workspace memory the function uses as it operates on an image. Pass `nil` to instruct the function to allocate, use, and then free its own temporary buffer.\n- **seedX**: The x-coordinate that defines the position of the seed pixel inside the connected component.\n- **seedY**: The y-coordinate that defines the position of the seed pixel inside the connected component.\n- **newValue**: The new pixel value that overwrites the pixels in the connected component.\n- **connectivity**: An integer that specifies which pixels the operation includes as neighbors. Pass either `4` or `8`. The four-connected neighborhood of a pixel are the pixels to the left and right, and those above and below. The eight-connected neighborhood also includes the pixels on the four diagonals.\n- **flags**: The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageDoNotTile]; otherwise, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageNoFlags].\n\nTo instruct the function to return the minimum size of the workspace memory, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageGetTempBufferSize] flag.\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageNoError]; otherwise, a negative value indicates one of the error codes that [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Accelerate\/data-types-and-constants] describes, and a positive value indicates the required size for the temporary buffer.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe flood-fill function sets all pixels that are neighboring and identical to the seed pixel to a new color.
