But, for small enough arguments, ExpM1(x) is expected to be more accurate than Exp(x) - 1.\n- **vlogf(_:)**: For each vector element, calculates the natural logarithm of `X`.\n- **vlog1pf(_:)**: For each vector element, calculates Log1P = Log(1 + x). But, for small enough arguments, Log1P is expected to be more accurate than Log(1 + x).\n- **vlogbf(_:)**: For each vector element, extracts the exponent of `X`, as a signed integral value. A subnormal argument is treated as though it were first normalized. Thus:   1  <=  x * 2^(-logb(x))  <  2.\n- **vlog2f(_:)**\n- **vvpows(_:_:_:_:)**: Calculates the cube root for each element of a vector.\n- **vvpowsf(_:_:_:_:)**: Calculates, elementwise, x**y for a vector x and a scalar y.\n- **vscalbf(_:_:)**: For each vector element, calculates x * 2^n efficiently.  This is not normally done by computing 2^n explicitly.\n\n",
