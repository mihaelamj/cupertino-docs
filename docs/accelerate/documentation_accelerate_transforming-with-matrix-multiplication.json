The functions multiply each source value by an `n x m` matrix to produce an `n`-element destination pixel. You can use matrix multiplication functions for tasks like converting between color spaces. For example, you can multiply three-channel RGB pixels by a 4 x 3 matrix to generate four-channel CMYK pixels.",
