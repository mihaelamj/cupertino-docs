You’re responsible for filling out the `height`, `width`, and `rowBytes` fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer to which this structure points contains the destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, you must deallocate the memory. The size dimensions of the destination buffer also specifies the size of the region of interest in the source buffer.\n- **tempBuffer**: A pointer to a temporary buffer. If you pass `NULL`, the function allocates the buffer, then deallocates it before returning. Alternatively, you can allocate the buffer yourself, in which case you’re responsible for deallocating it when you no longer need it.\n- **srcOffsetToROI_X**: The horizontal offset, in pixels, to the upper-left pixel of the region of interest within the source image.\n- **srcOffsetToROI_Y**: The vertical offset, in pixels, to the upper-left pixel of the region of interest within the source image.\n- **kernelX**: A pointer to the 1D horizontal weights.\n- **kernelX_width**: The number of elements in the horizontal weights array.\n- **kernelY**: A pointer to the 1D vertical weights.\n- **kernelY_width**: The number of elements in the vertical weights array.\n- **bias**: The value to add to each element in the convolution result, before performing any clipping.\n- **backgroundColor**: A background color. If you supply a color, you must also set the `kvImageBackgroundColorFill` flag, otherwise the function ignores the color.\n- **flags**: The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageDoNotTile].\n\nPass one of the following flags to specify how vImage handles pixel locations beyond the edge of the source image: [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageCopyInPlace], [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageTruncateKernel], [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageBackgroundColorFill], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageEdgeExtend].\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageNoError]; otherwise, one of the error codes in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Accelerate\/data-types-and-constants].\n\n## Discussion\n\nA separable convolution applies two separate 1D filters along the rows and columns of an image in succession.
