Something went wrong with symbolic factorization, nothing is valid.\n\n- indicated by `.symbolicFactorization.status < 0`\n2. Symbolic factorization was good, but failed in numeric factorization initialization.\n\n- indicated by `.symbolicFactorization.status >= 0 && .status < 0 && .numericFactorization == NULL`\n- symbolic factorization may be used for future calls.\n3. Symbolic factorization was good, factor allocated\/initialized correctly, but numeric factorization failed e.g. a Cholesky factorization of an indefinite matrix was attempted.\n\n- indicated by `.symbolicFactorization.status >= 0 && .status < 0 && .numericFactorization not NULL`\n- user may pass this object to `SparseRefactor_Double` with a modified matrix\n4. Symbolic and numeric factorizations are both good\n\n- indicated by `.status >= 0`\n\n\n\n",
