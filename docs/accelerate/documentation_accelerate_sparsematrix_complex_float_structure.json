  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe sparsity structure is represented in *block compressed sparse column* (block CSC) format. The matrix is divided into a regular grid of `rowCount x columnCount` blocks each of size `blockSize x blockSize`, and only blocks containing a non-zero entry are stored. CSC format is used to store the locations of these blocks. For each block column, a list of block row indices for non-zero blocks are stored, and the lists for each column are stored contiguously one after the other. Hence the row indices for column j are given by rowIndices`[columnStarts[j]:columnStarts[j+1]]`, where `columnStarts[]` is storing the location of the first index in each column.\n\nIf the blockSize is `1`, then this format is exactly equivalent to standard CSC format.\n\nCSR format data can be simulated by using a blockSize of `1` and setting the transpose attribute (strictly this is still a transposed CSC matrix, so `rowCount` and `columnCount` will be transposed compared to true CSR).",
