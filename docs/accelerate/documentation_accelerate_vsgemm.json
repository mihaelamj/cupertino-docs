Also, if `formb` = ‘N’, `m` is the number of rows in matrix `b`; if `formb` = ‘T’, `m` is the number of columns in matrix `b`. `m` must be a multiple of 4.\n- **n**: Number of columns in matrix `c`; must be a multiple of 4.\n- **a**: A matrix with elements of type `float`.  If `forma` = ‘N’, the matrix itself is used in the calculation and it has `l` rows and `m` columns.  If `forma` = ‘T’, the transpose is used and `a` has `m` rows and `l` columns. Thus the matrix used in the calculation is `l` by `n`.\n- **forma**: Selector with a value of ‘N’ or ‘T’.\n- **b**: A matrix with elements of type `float`.  If `formb` = ‘N’, the matrix itself is used in the calculation and it has `m` rows and `n` columns.  If `formb` = ‘T’, the transpose is used and `b` has `n` rows and `m` columns. Thus the matrix used in the calculation is `m` by `n`.\n- **formb**: Selector with a value of ‘N’ or ‘T’.\n- **c**: An `l` by `n` matrix with elements of type `float`.\n- **alpha**: Multiplier for matrix `a`.\n- **beta**: Multiplier for matrix `c`.\n- **matrix**: Destination matrix with `l` rows and `n` columns.\n\n## Discussion\n\nMatrix `a` (or its transpose) is multiplied by matrix `b` (or its transpose); matrix `c` is multiplied by `beta`, and the result is added to the result of the matrix multiplication; the result is stored in matrix `matrix`\n\n## Matrix Operations (from vectorOps.h)\n\n- **vSgeadd(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Adds two general matrices or their transposes.\n- **vSgesub(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Subtracts two general matrices or their transposes.\n- **vSgemul(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Multiplies two general matrices or their transposes.\n- **vSgetmi(_:_:)**: Transposes a matrix in place.\n- **vSgetmo(_:_:_:_:)**: Transposes a matrix out of place.\n- **vSgevv(_:_:_:_:_:)**: Produces the outer product of two vectors and places the results into a matrix.\n\n",
