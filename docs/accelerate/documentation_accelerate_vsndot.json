The dot product is accumulated or stored in `s`[i], according to the value of `isw`:\n\n- if `isw` = 1, the dot product is stored in `s`[i].\n- if `isw` = 2, the dot product is negated and then stored in `s`[i].\n- if `isw` = 3, the dot product is added to the value in `s`[i].\n- if `isw` = 4, the dot product is negated and then added to the value in `s`[i].\n\n## Vector-Scalar Linear Algebra Functions (from vectorOps.h)\n\n- **vIsamax(_:_:)**: Finds the position of the first vector element having the largest absolute value.\n- **vIsamin(_:_:)**: Finds the position of the first vector element having the smallest absolute value.\n- **vIsmax(_:_:)**: Finds the position of the first vector element having the maximum value.\n- **vIsmin(_:_:)**: Finds the position of the first vector element having the minimum value.\n- **vSasum(_:_:)**: Finds the sum of the absolute values of the elements in a vector.\n- **vSsum(_:_:)**: Finds the sum of the values of the elements in a vector.\n- **vSaxpy(_:_:_:_:)**: Multiplies a vector by a scalar , adds it to a second vector , and stores the result in the second vector.\n- **vSnaxpy(_:_:_:_:_:)**: Performs the computation of `vSaxpy` `n` times, using a different multiplier each time.\n- **vScopy(_:_:_:)**: Copies one vector to another.\n- **vSdot(_:_:_:)**: Computes the dot product of two vectors.\n- **vSnrm2(_:_:)**: Finds the Euclidean length of a vector.\n- **vSnorm2(_:_:)**: Finds the Euclidean length of a vector.\n- **vSrot(_:_:_:_:_:)**: Applies planar rotation to a set of n points whose x and y coordinates are contained in two arrays of vectors.\n- **vSscal(_:_:_:)**: Scales a vector in place.\n- **vSswap(_:_:_:)**: Interchanges the elements of two vectors.\n\n",
