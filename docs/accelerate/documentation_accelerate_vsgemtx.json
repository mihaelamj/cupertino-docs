Multiplies a matrix by another scalar, then by a second vector, and adds the resulting vector to the first vector. This function can also perform the calculation with the transpose of the original matrix instead of the matrix itself. A selector parameter determines whether the transpose is used.\n- **vSgemx(_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Multiplies a matrix by a scalar and then by a vector, and adds the resulting vector to a second vector.\n\n",
