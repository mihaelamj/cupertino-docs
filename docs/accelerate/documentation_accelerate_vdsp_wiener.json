A symmetric matrix is one that’s equal to its transpose, that is, a matrix that’s identical when swapping its row and column indices. A Toeplitz matrix is a matrix where each diagonal is constant.\n\nThe example below shows a matrix equation where the coefficient matrix is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix:\n\n\n\nThis function solves the equation and finds the values for the output vector, `__F`.\n\n\n\nBecause the 4 x 4 coefficient matrix is symmetric, it contains four diagonal bands that you define using a four-element vector. The following code shows how to solve a system of linear equations using [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/vDSP_wiener]:\n\nNote that this function only works out-of-place.\n\nTypical methods for solving *N* equations in *N* unknowns have execution times proportional to _N_3, and memory requirements proportional to _N_2. By taking advantage of duplicate elements, the recursion method implemented by [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/vDSP_wiener] executes in a time proportional to _N_2 and requires memory proportional to *N*. The Wiener-Levinson algorithm recursively builds a solution by computing the *m+1* matrix solution from the *m* matrix solution.\n\nYou can use the solution, *F*, as a Wiener filter.",
