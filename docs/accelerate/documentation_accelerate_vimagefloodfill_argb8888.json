This function always works in place, that is, the input and the output point to the same memory.\n- **tempBuffer**: A pointer to a temporary buffer. If you pass `nil`, the function allocates the buffer and then deallocates it before returning. Alternatively, you can allocate the buffer yourself, in which case you’re responsible for deallocating it when you no longer need it.\n- **seedX**: The x-coordinate that defines the position of the seed pixel inside the connected component.\n- **seedY**: The y-coordinate that defines the position of the seed pixel inside the connected component.\n- **newValue**: The new pixel value that overwrites the pixels in the connected component.\n- **connectivity**: An integer that specifies which pixels the operation includes as neighbors. Pass either `4` or `8`. The four-connected neighborhood of a pixel are the pixels to the left and right, and those above and below. The eight-connected neighborhood also includes the pixels on the four diagonals.\n- **flags**: The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageDoNotTile]; otherwise, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageNoFlags].\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageNoError]; otherwise, one of the error codes in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Accelerate\/data-types-and-constants].\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe flood-fill function sets all pixels that are neighboring and identical to the seed pixel to a new color. The operation continues until it reaches the image boundary or until it sets all pixels within the connected component to the new value.\n\n## Flood-filling buffers\n\n- **Applying flood fills to an image**: Fill consistently colored connected parts of an image with a new color.\n- **vImageFloodFill_Planar8(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Applies a flood-fill operation to an 8-bit planar image.\n- **vImageFloodFill_Planar16U(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Applies a flood fill-operation to an unsigned 16-bit planar image.\n- **vImageFloodFill_ARGB16U(_:_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Applies a flood-fill operation to an unsigned 16-bit-per-channel, four-channel interleaved image.\n\n",
