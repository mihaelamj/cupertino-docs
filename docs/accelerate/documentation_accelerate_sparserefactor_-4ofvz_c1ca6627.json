  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\n`Matrix` must have the same non-zero structure as that used for the original factorization.\n\nThe same numerical factorization options will be used as in the original construction of `Factorization`.\n\nThis call provides very similar behavior to that which can be achieved by reusing explicit storage supplied to `SparseFactor` as the argument `factorStorage`. However, in addition to providing a simplified call sequence, this call can also reuse any additional storage allocated to accomodate delayed pivots.\n\nNote that internal memory allocations may occur in the case of pivoted factorizations that result in delayed pivots. If you require closer control over memory allocations, supply an `sfoptions.malloc` function that implements the required behaviour, or use an alternative non-pivoted factorization returns. Note that if `sfoptions.malloc` returns `NULL` the factorization will abort immediately.\n\nNote that if the reference count of the underlying object is not exactly one (i.e. if there are any implict copies as a result of calls to `SparseGetTranspose` or `SparseCreateSubfactor()` that have not been destroyed through a call to `SparseCleanup`), then new storage will be allocated regardless.",
