Multiplies a matrix by another scalar, then by a second vector, and adds the resulting vector to the first vector. This function can also perform the calculation with the transpose of the original matrix instead of the matrix itself. A selector parameter determines whether the transpose is used.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nfunc vSgemv(_ forma: CChar, _ m: Int32, _ n: Int32, _ alpha: Float, _ a: UnsafePointer<vFloat>, _ x: UnsafePointer<vFloat>, _ beta: Float, _ y: UnsafeMutablePointer<vFloat>)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **forma**: Selects the variant computation to be performed: ‘T’ causes the transpose  of matrix `a` to be used, ‘N’ causes `a` itself to be used.\n- **m**: Number of rows in `a`. If `forma` = ‘N’, `m` is the length of vector `y`; if `forma` = ‘T’, `m` is the length of vector `x`; must be a multiple of 4.\n- **n**: Number of columns in `a`. If `forma` = ‘N’, `m` is the length of vector `x`; if `forma` = ‘T’, `m` is the length of vector `y`; must be a multiple of 4.\n- **alpha**: Scalar multiplier for matrix `a`.\n- **a**: `m` by `n` matrix with elements of type `float`.\n- **x**: Vector with elements of type `float`.\n- **beta**: Scalar multiplier for vector `y`.\n- **y**: Destination vector with `n` elements of type `float`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nVector `y` is multiplied by `beta`. Matrix `a` is multiplied by `alpha`. Then if `forma` = ‘N’, `a` is multiplied by vector `x`; if `forma` = ‘T’, the transpose of `a` is multiplied by `x`. The resulting vector is added to vector `y`, and the results are stored in `y`.\n\n## Matrix-Vector Linear Algebra Functions (from vectorOps.h)\n\n- **vSgemx(_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Multiplies a matrix by a scalar and then by a vector, and adds the resulting vector to a second vector.\n- **vSgemtx(_:_:_:_:_:_:)**: Forms the transpose of a matrix, multiplies it by a scalar and then by a vector, and adds the resulting vector to a second vector.\n\n",
