You’re responsible for filling out the `height`, `width`, and `rowBytes` fields of this structure and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.\n- **tempBuffer**: A pointer to workspace memory the function uses as it operates on an image. Pass `nil` to instruct the function to allocate, use, and then free its own temporary buffer.\n- **angleInRadians**: The rotation angle, in radians.\n- **backColor**: A background color. If you set the `kvImageBackgroundColorFill` flag, pass a pixel value.\n- **flags**: The options to use when applying the rotation.\n\nTo instruct the function to return the minimum size of the workspace memory, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageGetTempBufferSize] flag.\n\nTo specify how vImage handles pixel locations beyond the edge of the source image, set one of the following flags: [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageBackgroundColorFill] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageEdgeExtend].\n\nIf you want vImage to use a higher quality but a slower resampling filter, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageHighQualityResampling] flag.\n\nIf your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageDoNotTile].\n\nThis function ignores the [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageLeaveAlphaUnchanged] flag.\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageNoError]; otherwise, a negative value indicates one of the error codes that [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Accelerate\/data-types-and-constants] describes, and a positive value indicates the required size for the temporary buffer.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function maps the center point of the source image to the center point of the destination image.
