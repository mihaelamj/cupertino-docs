You’re responsible for filling out the `height`, `width`, and `rowBytes` fields of this structure and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.\n- **tempBuffer**: A pointer to workspace memory the function uses as it operates on an image. Pass `nil` to instruct the function to allocate, use, and then free its own temporary buffer.\n- **flags**: The options to use when applying the scale.\n\nTo instruct the function to return the minimum size of the workspace memory, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageGetTempBufferSize] flag.\n\nIf you want vImage to use a higher quality but a slower resampling filter, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageHighQualityResampling] flag.\n\nIf your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageDoNotTile].\n\nThis function ignores the [doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageLeaveAlphaUnchanged] flag.\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.accelerate\/documentation\/Accelerate\/kvImageNoError]; otherwise, a negative value indicates one of the error codes that [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Accelerate\/data-types-and-constants] describes, and a positive value indicates the required size for the temporary buffer.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe relative dimensions of the source image and the destination buffer determine the scaling factors. The function supports nonuniform scaling — that is, the horizontal and vertical ratios can be different.\n\nTo avoid artifacts in high-frequency regions of the image, supply image data that’s nonpremultiplied or that has a constant alpha over the entire image.\n\nThis function doesn’t work in place — that is, the source and destination buffers need to point to different memory.\n\n### Optimize performance with temporary buffers\n\nThis function uses a multiple-pass algorithm that saves intermediate pixel values between passes.

Reusing a buffer avoids vImage allocating the temporary storage with each call.\n\nTo use your own temporary buffer, first call the function with the same values for all other parameters that you intend to use for subsequent calls. In addition, pass the `kvImageGetTempBufferSize` flag. The `kvImageGetTempBufferSize` instructs the function not to perform any processing, and to return a positive value that represents the minimum size, in bytes, of the temporary buffer. A negative return value represents an error.\n\nAfter you allocate the memory for the temporary buffer, pass that to the `tempBuffer` parameter for subsequent calls to the function, and don’t pass the `kvImageGetTempBufferSize` flag.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Applying geometric transforms to images**: Reflect, shear, rotate, and scale image buffers using vImage.\n\n## Planar Image Scaling\n\n- **vImageScale_Planar16U(_:_:_:_:)**: Scales an unsigned 16-bit planar image to fit a destination buffer.\n- **vImageScale_Planar16S(_:_:_:_:)**: Scales a signed 16-bit planar image to fit a destination buffer.\n- **vImageScale_Planar16F(_:_:_:_:)**: Scales a floating-point 16-bit planar image to fit a destination buffer.\n- **vImageScale_PlanarF(_:_:_:_:)**: Scales a 32-bit planar image to fit a destination buffer.\n\n",
