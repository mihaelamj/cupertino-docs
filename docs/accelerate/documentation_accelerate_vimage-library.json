It includes functions for image manipulation—convolutions, geometric transformations, histogram operations, morphological transformations, and alpha compositing—as well as utility functions for format conversions and other operations.\n\nvImage optimizes image processing by using the CPU’s vector processor. If a vector processor is not available, vImage uses the next best available option. This framework allows you to reap the benefits of vector processors without the need to write vectorized code.\n\nvImage is particularly suited for:\n\n- Efficiently processing large images\n- Real-time video processing software\n- Scientific applications that require high-accuracy numerical calculations\n\n## First Steps\n\n- **Converting bitmap data between Core Graphics images and vImage buffers**: Pass image data between Core Graphics and vImage to create and manipulate images.\n- **Creating and Populating Buffers from Core Graphics Images**: Initialize vImage buffers from Core Graphics images.\n- **Creating a Core Graphics Image from a vImage Buffer**: Create displayable representations of vImage buffers.\n- **Building a Basic Image-Processing Workflow**: Resize an image
