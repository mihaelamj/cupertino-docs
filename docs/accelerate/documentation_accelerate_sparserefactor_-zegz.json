However, in addition to providing a simplified call sequence, this call can also reuse any additional storage allocated to accomodate delayed pivots.\n\nNote that if the reference count of the underlying object is not exactly one (i.e. if there are any implict copies as a result of calls to `SparseGetTranspose` or `SparseCreateSubfactor()` that have not been destroyed through a call to `SparseCleanup`), then new storage will be allocated regardless.",
