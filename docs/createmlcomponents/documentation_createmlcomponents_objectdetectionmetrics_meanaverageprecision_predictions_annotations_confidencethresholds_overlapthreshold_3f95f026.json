Each element in the list is a list of predictions from one image.\n- **annotations**: A list of all the annotations. Each element is an `ObjectDetectionAnnotation` object from one image.\n- **confidenceThresholds**: Confidence thresholds for each label. The values will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. If any label does not have a threshold, the `defaultConfidenceThreshold` is used for that label. The default value is `[:]`.\n- **overlapThreshold**: The overlap threshold for the bounding boxes. The value will always be between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is `0.5`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe mean average precision at the overlap threshold.\n\n## Calculating the precision\n\n- **averageOfAveragePrecisionAtVariedThresholds(predictions:annotations:confidenceThresholds:)**: Calculates average of average precision for all the labels, computed at varied bounding box overlap thresholds. The overlap thresholds range is from `[0.05, 0.95]` with a stride of `0.05`.\n- **averageOfMeanAveragePrecisionAtVariedThresholds(predictions:annotations:confidenceThresholds:)**: Calculates the average of mean average precision, computed at varied bounding box overlap thresholds. The overlap thresholds range is from `[0.05, 0.95]` with a stride of `0.05`.\n- **averagePrecision(predictions:annotations:confidenceThresholds:overlapThreshold:)**: Calculates average precision for all the labels at the bounding box overlap threshold.\n\n",
