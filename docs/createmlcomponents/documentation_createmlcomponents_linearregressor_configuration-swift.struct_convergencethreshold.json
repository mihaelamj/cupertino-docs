The threshold is also used by the `fitted` method to decide when progress is no longer being made, in which case the training process will stop before convergence and before the specified maximum number of iterations (known as early stopping).\n\nConsider reducing this value for a more accurately trained model. But beware of overfitting if the it is set to a very low value. Defaults to 0.01.",
