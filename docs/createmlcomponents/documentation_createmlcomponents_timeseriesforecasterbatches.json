To train a forecaster, each training batch contains the input samples along with the annotations (ground truth predictions). For example a batch could have this:\n\nThe shape of the features in the sequence is `[batchSize, inputWindowSize, featureSize]` and the shape of the annotations is `[batchSize, forecastWindowSize, annotationSize]`. The batch sequence will return as many feature-annotation examples as fit in the input. For example, an input sequence size of 10 with an input sample count of 4 and a prediction sample count of 2 will produce 5 examples:\n\nNote that 9 and 10 are never used as features because there would be no annotations for those examples.",
