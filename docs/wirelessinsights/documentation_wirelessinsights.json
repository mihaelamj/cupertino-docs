The framework collects metrics on the device about cellular conditions, such as whether the device is in service, current cellular congestion, and more. With this information, you can improve someone’s experience using your app.\n\nWhen your app receives a notification about a potential degradation of cellular service, you can adapt to the problem in a number of ways:\n\n- Prefetch and buffer data prior to the event.\n- Reduce your bit rate.\n- Defer activity to a time when cellular conditions are better.\n- Build in additional retries.\n\nThe app receives an asynchronous sequence of [doc:\/\/com.apple.WirelessInsights\/documentation\/WirelessInsights\/ServicePrediction] instances, which describe anticipated events in terms of their impact and expected timing. The prediction includes metrics indicating the level of confidence in each factor of the prediction.\n\nYour app can take action appropriate to its use of cellular data; for example:\n\n- A streaming media app might react to a prediction of a lengthy, high-impact event by buffering media in advance of the event. Or, the app might proactively reduce its bit rate.\n- An app that performs one-time downloads of large files might defer a download until after an event passes.\n\n\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **ServicePredictionProvider**: A class that provices cellular service predictions about upcoming events and anomalies.\n- **Wireless Insights Service Predictions**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the app can use the WirelessInsights framework to obtain wireless service predictions.\n\n",
