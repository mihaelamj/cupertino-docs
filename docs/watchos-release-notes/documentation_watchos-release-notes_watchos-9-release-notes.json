The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-14-release-notes].\n\n### General\n\n- After updating to watchOS 9, your Apple Watch Series 4 or Series 5 will recalibrate and then estimate its maximum battery capacity more accurately. (93206868)\n\n### CallKit\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Compilation of apps integrated with CallKit might result in an error: “Value of type `CXProviderConfiguration` has no member `supportedHandleTypes` on watchOS 9”. (97582165)\n\n**Workaround:** Use `__supportedHandleTypes` instead of `supportedHandleTypes`.\n\n### CoreGraphics\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- To improve security, `CGImageCreate` enforces parameter correctness on macOS 13 Ventura, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, watchOS 9, and tvOS 16. Passing an incorrect `CGImageByteOrderInfo` is no longer supported, and will result in images failing to load. (94855401)\n\n### DeviceDiscoveryUI\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Devices running beta 4 or later aren’t backwards compatible with devices running earlier beta versions. (95233878)\n\n### Health\n\n#### New Features\n\n- AFib History is now available in the United States. (95627199)\n\n### HealthKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- HealthKit workout APIs now support multisport workouts with activities of swimming, cycling, and running. (82588168)\n\n- New data types for running workout metrics like running power, ground contact time, vertical oscillation, running speed, and stride length. (82974514)\n\n### Networking\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added `NSURLSession` support for client-certificate based authentication. (24523955)\n\n- Added `URLSession` support for Private Access Tokens. (82937526)\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- FTP is deprecated for `URLSession` and related APIs. Please adopt modern secure networking protocols such as HTTPS. (92623659)\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- The `recentSubscriptionStartDate` property is included in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/SubscriptionInfo\/RenewalInfo]. It represents the date that marks the start of the most recent period of continuous subscription. A period is considered a continuous subscription if there’s no more than a 60-day gap between any two subscribed periods. (86599570)\n\n- Present the offer code redemption sheet with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/offerCodeRedemption(isPresented:onCompletion:)] view modifier in your SwiftUI apps. (85321941)\n\n- The StoreKit Messages API allows you to control when App Store messages are displayed in your app. (85321880)\n\n- `Product` has new properties for localizing prices and subscription periods. For iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS 12, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8 or later use `priceFormatStyle` to format numbers derived from `price`. Use `subscriptionPeriodFormatStyle` to format durations of time relating to a subscription period. On iOS 16, iPadOS 16, macOS 13, tvOS 16, and watchOS 9 or later use `subscriptionPeriodUnitFormatStyle` to format single units of a subscription period. (93780442)\n\n- A property environment is included in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/SubscriptionInfo\/RenewalInfo] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Transaction]. It represents the server environment in which the `RenewalInfo` and `Transaction` occurred, respectively. (85988753)\n\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/AppTransaction] allows developers to cryptographically verify that the app was purchased on the App Store. (86739279)\n\n- All [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit] APIs are now annotated for sendability and main actor isolation. (84157048)\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- Deprecated the SKDownload API and removed the option to upload nonconsumable in-app purchase assets for Apple to host. In addition, support for managing these assets in App Store Connect is no longer available as of April 2022. (89764253)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Custom types conforming to `ToolbarContent` now support dynamic properties like `@Environment`. (94117842)\n\n- For `control`, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Section], or other views that have a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Label], the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ViewBuilder] content now automatically arranges and styles multiple views as hierarchical elements, such as `title` and `subtitle`. If the `label` views are intended to be arranged horizontally rather than hierarchically, wrap the views within an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack]. (85184563)\n\n### Voice Shortcuts\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- When saying an App Shortcut phrase to Siri, Siri launches the app or ends up with an unexpected result. (93611920)\n\n### Wallet\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- American Express cards might need to be removed and re-added to Wallet after updating to watchOS 9 beta 6 or later.
