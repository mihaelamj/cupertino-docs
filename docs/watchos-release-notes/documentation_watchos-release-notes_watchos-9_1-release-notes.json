The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.1 RC, available from [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/download\/]. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.1, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-14_1-release-notes].\n\n### Memory Allocation\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The system memory allocator `free` operation zeroes out most deallocated blocks in watchOS 9.1 beta or later. Invalid accesses to free memory might result in new crashes or corruption, including:\n\n- Read-after-free bugs that previously observed the old contents of a block may now observe zeroes instead\n- Write-after-free bugs may now cause subsequent calls to `calloc` to return non-zero memory\n\nTo debug these issues, use Address Sanitizer and Guard Malloc (see `libgmalloc(3)`).
