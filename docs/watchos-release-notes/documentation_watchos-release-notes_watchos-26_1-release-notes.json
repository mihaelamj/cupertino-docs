(151889745)\n- Fixed: HealthKit authorization UI on watchOS shows separate switches for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, instead of a singular switch like iOS and visionOS.  (159711055)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The `navigationLinkIndicatorVisibility` modifier crashes when run on iOS 17, iOS 18 and aligned releases.\n\nYou must recompile your app against the 26.1 SDK to receive this fix.
