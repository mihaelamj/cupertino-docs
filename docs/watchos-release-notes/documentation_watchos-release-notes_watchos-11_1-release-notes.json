For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 16.1, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-16_1-release-notes].\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: In StoreKit Testing in Xcode, the offer identifier in the subscription renewal info might be reported incorrectly for offer codes.  (133774710)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Using `if #available` in @WidgetBundleBuilder and @SceneBuilder crashes on prior OS versions due to “unknown OS version.”  (136098106)\n\n### WidgetKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Rectangular complications and Watch-specific custom Live Activity views use the wrong font metrics, causing title2 and title3 to render much larger than intended and largeTitle to render much smaller than intended. Additionally, custom Live Activity views use the wrong default font (SF Pro instead of SF Compact).
