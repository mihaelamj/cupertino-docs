The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.3, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.3, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-14_3-release-notes].\n\n### General\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm) now estimates its maximum battery capacity more accurately. (105740118)\n\n### Medications\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Users who were previously on 9.2.1 build may experience issues of missing Medication Schedule on Watch, or Medication dose logged on Watch not appearing on Phone (106108448)\n\n**Workaround:** 1) On companion iPhone: remove the affected medication schedule and re-add it. Or 2) On affected Watch: erase and reinstall as new device any releases after 9.2.1\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `ScrollView` has improved support for right to left languages by default. If you have a `ScrollView` that shouldn’t change its behavior in right to left languages, use the `.environment(\\.layoutDirection, .leftToRight)` modifier to ensure the `ScrollView` always sees a left to right layout direction. (65108729)\n- Fixed: Presentations in SwiftUI using the ‘sheet’ or ‘fullScreenCover’ modifier can now be dynamically presented again while a dismiss animation is in progress. Previously, attempting to present again in this case would do nothing.\n\nNote: A data race in app code that was previously ignored might cause a sheet to be presented again with this change. If this happens, check that your state isn’t triggering a new presentation.
