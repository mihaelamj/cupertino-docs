The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 13, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 13, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-13-release-notes].\n\n### CoreData\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- `NSExpression` immediately forbids certain operations that have significant side effects, like creating and destroying objects. Additionally, casting string class names into Class objects with `NSConstantValueExpression` is deprecated. (84017178)\n\n**Workaround:** Pass temporary objects to `NSExpression` in the context parameter of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSExpression\/expressionValue(with:context:)], or with `NSPredicate` as the `substitutionVariables` parameter of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSPredicate\/evaluate(with:substitutionVariables:)]. You can create a derived predicate with all the substitution variables replaced (bound), using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSPredicate\/withSubstitutionVariables(_:)] on an existing `NSPredicate` so that code using the object can continue to use a simple `evaluate(with object: Any?)` invocation.\n\n## watchOS 8\n\n- **watchOS 8.7 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **watchOS 8.6 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **watchOS 8.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **watchOS 8.4 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **watchOS 8.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **watchOS 8 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
