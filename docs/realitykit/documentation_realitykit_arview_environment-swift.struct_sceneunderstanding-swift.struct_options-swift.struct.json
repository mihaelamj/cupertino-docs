It overrides other options in the options set.\n- **occlusion**: The `.occlusion` option means that the reconstructed geometry will be used for rendering, but only to update the depth buffer. Parts of virtual objects which are behind the reconstructed geometry are not rendered.\n- **physics**: No abstract\n- **receivesLighting**: The `.receivesLighting` option means that the virtual lights will interact with real world surfaces causing them to shine. The properties  of the mesh will be set to a default material.\n\n## Scene reconstructions and analysis\n\n- **Creating a game with scene understanding**: Create AR games and experiences that interact with real-world objects on LiDAR-equipped iOS devices.\n- **Implementing scene understanding and reconstruction in your RealityKit app**: Detect objects in an AR scene or create a detailed 3D reconstruction of the real-world environment.\n- **Visualizing and interacting with a reconstructed scene**: Estimate the shape of the physical environment using a polygonal mesh.\n- **sceneReconstruction**: A flag that enables scene reconstruction.\n- **supportsSceneReconstruction(_:)**: Checks if the device supports scene reconstruction.\n- **SceneUnderstandingComponent**: A component that specifies an entity is participating in the system’s scene-understanding features.\n- **ARView.Environment.SceneUnderstanding**: An object that holds scene-understanding options for the view.\n- **HasSceneUnderstanding**: A specification that detects and reacts to features of the physical environment.\n- **SceneReconstructionProvider**: A source of live data about the shape of a person’s surroundings.\n- **ARSession**: The object that manages the major tasks associated with every AR experience, such as motion tracking, camera passthrough, and image analysis.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- Equatable\n- ExpressibleByArrayLiteral\n- OptionSet\n- RawRepresentable\n- SetAlgebra\n\n",
