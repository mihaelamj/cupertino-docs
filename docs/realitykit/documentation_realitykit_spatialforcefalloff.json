Under the hood the rate is an exponent of the normalized distance over the spatial bounds. For example when the rate is 0, the falloff coefficient (i.e. distance raised to the power of 0) is constantly 1, and that implies no decay or falloff the force strength.\n\nAs another example, you can set [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/SpatialForceFalloff\/rate] to `1` to decay the force strength linearly.",
