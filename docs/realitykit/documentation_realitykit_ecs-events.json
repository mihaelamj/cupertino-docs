The kinds of events you can subscribe to include the following:\n\n- Two entities colliding\n- An entity receiving a new component\n- Audio playback reaching the end of its content\n\nFor example, you can receive a notification:\n\n- When two objects begin colliding by subscribing to [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/CollisionEvents\/Began] event\n- When the scene redraws by subscribing to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/SceneEvents\/Update] event\n\n## Core event types\n\n- **Event**: A type that can be sent as an event.\n- **EventSource**: A type on which events can be published and subscribed.\n- **EventSubscription**: A subscription to an event.\n\n## Scene and entity lifecycle events\n\n- **SceneEvents**: Events the scene invokes.\n- **AnchorStateEvents**: Events that trigger on an entity to indicate a change in anchor state.\n- **ComponentEvents**: Provides the events related to components.\n\n## Input and interaction events\n\n- **AccessibilityEvents**\n- **ManipulationEvents**: Events that occur while a person manipulates an entity.\n\n## Physics and motion events\n\n- **AnimationEvents**: Notable milestones that the framework signals during animation playback.\n- **CollisionEvents**\n- **PhysicsSimulationEvents**: Types of events that fire during physics simulations\n\n## Media events\n\n- **AudioEvents**: Events associated with audio playback.\n- **VideoPlayerEvents**: Events associated with video playback for VideoPlayerComponent.\n- **ImagePresentationEvents**: Events associated with viewing mode transitions for image presentation components.\n\n## Network synchronization events\n\n- **SynchronizationEvents**: Events associated with network synchronization of scene information.\n\n## Scene management and logic\n\n- **Scenes**: The context that holds all RealityKit entities.\n- **Systems**: Apply behaviors and physical effects to the entities in a RealityKit scene.\n- **Entity actions**: Create simple, reusable actions that can change your app state, RealityKit scene, or animate an entity.\n\n",
