You typically add a single view to your app’s storyboard, and then provide an outlet for that view in your code. Alternatively, you can create and add a view to your view hierarchy programmatically at runtime, as you would any other view.\n\nA view has a single [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/Scene] instance that you access through the read-only [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/ARView\/scene] property.
