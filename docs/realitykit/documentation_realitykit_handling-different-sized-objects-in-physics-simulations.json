You need to set up scenes containing those tiny objects differently to ensure that they simulate realistically.\n\n### Use the default hierarchy for most scenes\n\nSet up most RealityKit scenes — those without very tiny objects — so that you’ve parented all entities to a single anchor entity that acts as both the root of the visible scene and the origin of the physics simulation. With this setup, you can rotate and move the anchor in the scene without affecting the physics simulation because RealityKit applies anchor transforms after calculating the physics simulation.\n\n\n\nReality Composer automatically sets up its scenes this way with no additional work needed.
