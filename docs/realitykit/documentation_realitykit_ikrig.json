This process ensures that each demand, ranging from forward kinematics (FK) demands to constraints on joint movement, affects the pose proportionally to its importance.\n\nThe solver reads the FK demands from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/SkeletalPosesComponent]. As such these demands are either a playing animation for the model, or just a static pose.\n\nAll demands have an element specific weight, and some have a global rig weight. The rig weights influence the overall rig, while element weights adjust individual aspects of the model.\n\nThe table below provides detailed mappings of these weights to their respective demand types.",
