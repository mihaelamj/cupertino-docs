  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen you add Reality Composer to your project, Xcode automatically generates code to handle many common tasks, such as loading scenes, retrieving objects, and triggering behaviors.\n\nWhen you build in Xcode, it converts any Reality Composer file in the current target into a more compact, read-only format called a *Reality* *file*, which has the extension `.reality`. You can also export Reality files directly from Reality Composer to use, for example, as downloadable content for your app. Although Xcode accepts both file types, you’ll typically use these editable Reality Composer project files during development.\n\nXcode generates both asynchronous and synchronous load methods. Unless your Reality Composer scene is very small, you should use the asynchronous method, which loads scenes in the background. Synchronous loading always occurs on the main thread, so your app may become unresponsive if you use that method to load even moderately complex scenes.\n\n### Load Reality files asynchronously using generated code\n\nFor every scene in a Reality file, Xcode generates an asynchronous loading method. This method helps keep your app responsive when loading larger scenes. Xcode bases the name of each generated asynchronous loading method on the name of the scene it loads and the Reality file that contains it. Instead of returning the loaded object directly, these asynchronous loading methods return the loaded scene through a completion block.\n\nThe following example code loads a scene using the generated asynchronous load function:\n\n### Load Reality files synchronously using generated code\n\nXcode also creates a synchronous loading method for each scene in your Reality Composer projects. As with generated asynchronous methods, it bases the name of each generated method on the name of the scene it loads and the Reality Composer file that contains that scene.\n\nThe following example code synchronously loads a scene called Box from a Reality Composer project called Experience:\n\n### Show the scene\n\nAfter you load the Reality Composer scene, you display it to the user by adding it to the scene anchors of an [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/ARView]. Reality Composer scenes contain anchoring information, which allows RealityKit to automatically find an appropriate surface, object, or image, and anchor your scene to it. For example, RealityKit automatically places a horizontally anchored scene as soon as ARKit detects a flat horizontal surface. Similarly, it displays a scene with an image anchor when ARKit detects the specified image at the correct size.\n\nTo use automatic anchoring, add the loaded scene to the view’s anchors:\n\nFor more control, you can also anchor your scene manually. See doc:taking-control-of-scene-anchoring.\n\n### Remove the scene\n\nTo remove the Reality Composer scene so the user can no longer see or interact with it, remove the object from the view’s anchors.\n\nTo remove all content from the view, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/Entity\/ComponentSet\/removeAll()] method instead.",
