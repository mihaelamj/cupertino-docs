  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe `focus` parameter is in the range `0...1` where `0` is the default. The default `.beam(focus: 0)` projects sound of all frequencies evenly in all directions, where the rotation of the spatial audio source has no impact on the tonality of the sound. A `focus` of `0` is commonly referred to as “omnidirectional”.\n\nIncreasing the `focus` parameter up to `1` will constrain the projection to increasingly narrow beam patterns, with high frequencies being more directional than low frequencies. A spatial audio source with a non-zero `focus` will sound “darker” when auditioning the source from the rear.",
