Apps typically use kinematic mode for entities the app programmatically controls, such as in response to a control or a person’s interaction. For entities that don’t need to move at all, set its physics body’s mode to [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/PhysicsBodyMode\/static].\n\nPhysics bodies in `static` or `kinematic` mode can’t collide with other physics bodies with either mode, by default. Optionally, you can add collision support for entities that have a physics body in either static or kinematic mode by adding a [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/PhysicsSimulationComponent] to an entity that’s a common ancestor to the entities you want to collide. Then you can set [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/PhysicsSimulationComponent\/CollisionOptions-swift.struct] to your preference.\n\nYou can change the mode of an entity’s physics body at any time, but changing it from `static` to another mode can affect your app’s performance because the transition to a non-static mode can trigger the simulation to rebuild its state.",
