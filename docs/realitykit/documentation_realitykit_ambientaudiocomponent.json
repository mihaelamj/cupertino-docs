Ambient audio sources take into account the relative orientation of the source and the listener. Position is not taken into account; the channels do not get louder as the user moves toward them.\n\nThe audio resource’s front channels (e.g., mono, center) are projected into the entity’s -Z direction, with the rear channels projected into +Z. The left channels are laid out in -X and the right channels are laid out in +X.\n\nThe `AmbientAudioComponent` allows you to set the overall level of all sounds played from the entity with the `gain` property, in relative Decibels, in the range `-.infinity ... .zero` where `-infinity` is silent and `.zero` is nominal.\n\nAmbient audio sources are well suited to play back multichannel content which captures the acoustics of its originating environment in the recording process (e.g., multichannel field recordings of outdoor environments).",
