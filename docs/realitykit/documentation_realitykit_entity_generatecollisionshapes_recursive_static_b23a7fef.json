Set this to `true` to indicate the colliders don’t move. Non-moving, static colliders are more efficient to use than non-static ones.\n\n## Discussion\n\nCall this method on entities that have a mesh to prepare a shape used for collision detection. The method stores the shape in the entity’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/CollisionComponent] instance.\n\nThis method has no effect for entities without a mesh.
