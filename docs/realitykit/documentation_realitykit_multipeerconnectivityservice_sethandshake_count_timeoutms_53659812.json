Once it receives the correct response, it begins syncing the local RealityKit scene with the other connected app.\n\nBy default, RealityKit sends at most two handshake packets to a peer and waits up to 25,000 ms (25 seconds) for the peer to respond before giving up and disconnecting. Call this method to change the timeout or the number of handshake packets to send.",
