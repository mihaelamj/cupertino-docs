Fast-moving, real-world objects captured within a frame can experience a visual smearing, known as *motion blur*.\n\nBy default, RealityKit applies an effect that introduces motion blur for virtual objects that appear in the scene. The effect takes into account the relative motion of the camera and the virtual object.\n\nIf the motion blur effect is disabled by setting the `motionBlur` property to `.disabled`, virtual objects will be rendered at exactly one position in the frame for any given image in the image sequence. Disabling motion blur reduces the computational cost of rendering.\n\nWhen deciding whether to use any effect, be sure to consider your app’s CPU and GPU utilization, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/improving-the-performance-of-a-realitykit-app].",
