  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse a load method to bring an entity stored in a file into your app. You can load USD files (.usd, .usda, .usdc, .usdz) and Reality files (.reality) this way. You get a Reality file by exporting a project from the Reality Composer app, as described in doc:creating-3d-content-with-reality-composer.\n\n### Load an entity hierarchy synchronously\n\nUse the `load(named:in:)` method to load an entity hierarchy from a USD or Reality file stored in a bundle. This method returns only after the operation completes. Omit the bundle parameter from the method call to load from the app’s main bundle:\n\nTo load an entity stored at a specific location in the file system, create a file URL and use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/Entity\/load(contentsOf:withName:)] method instead:\n\nThe load methods preserve the entity hierarchy in the loaded file and return the root entity in the scene that the USD or Reality file contains. The entity can have any number of descendant entities that you access using the methods of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/HasHierarchy] protocol. Accessing entities this way enables you to store and import sophisticated compositions from a single asset.\n\n### Load an entity hierarchy asynchronously\n\nSynchronous load operations block the thread on which you call them. To maintain a smooth user interface, use an asynchronous load instead. The entity initializer has an asynchronous overload. For example, load from a bundle asynchronously by calling the method:\n\nCall the asynchronous version of these initializers by prefacing the call with the await keyword from asynchronous methods or from inside of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Task] These overloads give you access to the full set of features [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/concurrency] provides.\n\n### Load an anchor entity\n\nWhen you want to load a composition rooted by an anchor entity, you can instead use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/Entity\/loadAnchor(named:in:)] method, or one of its siblings. These methods behave like the related load methods, except that they specifically return an [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/AnchorEntity] instance that you can add to your scene:\n\nAs with the load methods, the load anchor methods preserve the entity hierarchy.\n\n### Load a flattened model or body-tracked entity\n\nTo load a model or body-tracked entity with internal structure that you don’t need to access, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/Entity\/loadModel(named:in:)] or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/Entity\/loadBodyTracked(named:in:)] method, respectively. These methods and their siblings flatten the entity hierarchy into a single entity cast either as a [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/ModelEntity] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/BodyTrackedEntity]. A flattened entity can be easier to work with when you don’t need access to the entity’s details.",
