Auto-capture still proceeds but reconstruction quality may suffer.  It is advised to increase lighting.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.environmentTooDark**: The lighting in the environment is too dark to proceed.  Auto-capture will stop and the user will need to increase lighting levels to resolve this condition in order to continue capture.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.movingTooFast**: The user is moving too quickly for clear images and the capturing may be paused to ensure quality.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectNotDetected**: If the detection of the object fails and a default manual box is presented instead, this element will be in the feedback to allow relevant information to be provided to the user for selecting a manual scanning volume and describing the operational envelope for the automatic object detection.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectNotFlippable**: It is not recommended to flip this object since is is unlikely the algorithm will be able to stitch the flipped orientation.  This is usually due to feature-less, low-texture objects.  In this case, multiple passes at different heights leaving object at its original orientation are recommended instead of flipping.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectTooClose**: The camera is too close to the object and it cannot be tracked well.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.objectTooFar**: The camera is too far from the object and it cannot be captured well.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.outOfFieldOfView**: The bounding box of the object is not in the field of view of the camera so auto-capture will not operate.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Feedback.overCapturing**: If the `numberOfShotsTaken > maximumNumberOfInputImages` then any additional shots will not be used in an on-device reconstruction and reconstruction is recommended to be done on a Mac that can support a greater number of images.\n\n## Configuring a session\n\n- **feedback**: The current set of active `Feedback` states.\n- **isPaused**: A Boolean value that indicates if the capture session is paused.\n- **state**: The current state of the capture session.\n- **cameraTracking**: The current state of ARKit camera tracking.\n- **ObjectCaptureSession.Tracking**: A data structure that describes the current tracking state for the camera.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- Copyable\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
