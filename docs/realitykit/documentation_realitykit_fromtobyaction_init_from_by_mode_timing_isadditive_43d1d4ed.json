Alternatively, interpolates towards the default source if `by` is not supplied.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\ninit(from: Value, by: Value? = nil, mode: FromToByAction<Value>.TransformMode = .default, timing: AnimationTimingFunction = .linear, isAdditive: Bool = false)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **from**: Transform set at the start of the animation.\n- **by**: Transform which is used to increment the starting transform. Used to determine the final transform we animate towards. Set this to `nil` to animate towards the defaultSource transform.\n- **mode**: Determines what space the transforms are relative to.\n- **timing**: Controls the progress of the animation.\n- **isAdditive**: Specifies whether you can additively blend the output from the action’s animation.\n\n## Discussion\n\n`from` → `from + by` or `from` → `defaultSource`\n\n",
