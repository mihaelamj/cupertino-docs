Discarding faces that aren’t part of the final render eliminates the need to do any calculations for those faces.\n\nRealityKit recognizes when a face aims toward the camera (a front face) or away from the camera (a back face). This value controls the type of faces RealityKit culls.\n\nThis value defaults to [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/MaterialParameterTypes\/FaceCulling\/back], which means RealityKit removes faces that point away from the camera. Most of the time, this is the correct behavior, because back faces are usually obscured by other front-facing polygons.\n\nYou can change the culling behavior to cull front faces instead or to turn off face culling altogether, but be aware that turning off face culling results in less efficient rendering and may negatively impact your app’s frame rate.",
