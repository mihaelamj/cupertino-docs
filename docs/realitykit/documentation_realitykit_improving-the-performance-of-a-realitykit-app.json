It also relies on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Metal] framework and GPU hardware to perform multithreaded rendering.\n\n\n\nAlthough RealityKit handles much of the complexity of this system for you, it’s still important to optimize your app for performance. Use debugging features built in to RealityKit — along with standard tools like Xcode and Instruments — to pinpoint the causes of reduced frame rate. Then make data-driven adjustments to your assets or to the way you use the framework to improve performance.\n\n### Locate performance bottlenecks\n\nTo address performance problems, you need data. RealityKit provides a debugging option to collect a basic set of statistics, like CPU utilization, ECS operations, and memory footprint. Add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/ARView\/DebugOptions-swift.struct\/showStatistics] option to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/ARView\/debugOptions-swift.property] option set of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/ARView]:\n\nAs a result, the view draws an overlay that displays statistics, updated in real time.\n\n\n\nRealityKit typically limits the refresh rate — the rate at which the framework renders updates for the screen — to 60 frames per second (fps). This rate limits each of the main and render threads, as well as the GPU, to 16.6 ms to complete all computations per rendered frame. The overlay reports the observed frame rate, as well as the measured main and render thread times. It also provides granular detail about time spent in the main thread, such as when performing tasks like ECS updates and physics calculations. For more information about the visible metrics, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/ARView\/DebugOptions-swift.struct\/showStatistics].\n\nIf the main thread consumes more than 16.6 ms, then the app is CPU limited. If not, but the frame rate remains consistently below 60 fps, then the app is probably GPU limited. Use this information and the other data in the overlay to drive changes in your app.\n\n### Reduce CPU utilization\n\nFor an app that’s CPU limited, examine what RealityKit task or tasks — like rendering, ECS, physics, network, and so on — consume the most time during each frame. Also consider your app’s custom logic, which contributes to the main thread time. Then target the appropriate areas for optimization, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/reducing-cpu-utilization-in-your-realitykit-app].\n\n### Reduce GPU utilization\n\nIf your app is GPU limited, look for ways to reduce render work. For example, you can reduce the complexity of your content, like textures, meshes, and materials. Alternatively, you can disable or scale back certain render features, like depth of field, shadows, and environmental texturing. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/reducing-gpu-utilization-in-your-realitykit-app].\n\n### Make runtime adjustments for older devices\n\nBe sure to test your app on all supported devices before shipping your app. If you find that older devices can’t achieve the full frame rate, experiment with complexity reductions that you can make dynamically. For example:\n\nDetermine which adjustments you need for different kinds of hardware, and then choose different code paths based on the hardware you detect at runtime.
