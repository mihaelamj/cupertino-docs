You can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/DockingRegionComponent] to customize the width and location of the docking region.\n\nThis sample code project demonstrates how to use the RealityKit API for the docking-region component. You define and specify the boundary of the docking region and docking position using a docking-region component, and attach it to an entity within the immersive scene. Then you position the entity that has the docking-region component to customize the docking position.\n\nThe docking-region component allows developers to customize the docking region. Alternatively, you can add and define a docking-region component using Reality Composer Pro. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/building-an-immersive-experience-with-realitykit] for more details.\n\nThe sample app presents an AV player view controller with default playback controls, and a scene picker for selecting immersive scenes. You can start video playback with the default controls, and enter an immersive scene with the immersive view picker.\n\nYou can dock a video player by following the steps below.\n\n### Create an immersive visionOS app\n\nIn Xcode, choose File > New > Project, select visionOS and Immersive Environment App in the New Project dialog, and click Next.\n\n\n\nEnter your product name and organization identifier, and choose between a progressive and full immersive space. You can change the immersive setting later.\n\nTo continue, include a video in the bundle or provide a URL to an external video in `AVPlayerViewModel.swift`. The Immersive Environment App template launches with a window that includes a single button to show the immersive space. Showing the immersive space starts playing the video and displays the `AVPlayerView` full screen in the window. The system automatically docks this full-screen video in the default docking position.\n\n### Play the video in the shared space\n\nTo play the video in the shared space and immersive space, remove the calls to the `avPlayerViewModel` in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/onAppear(perform:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/onDisappear(perform:)] methods of `ImmersiveView`. Remove the `ToggleImmersiveSpaceButton` from the `ContentView` and replace it with a button that plays the video. At this point, the app plays the video full screen after someone taps the Play Video button, but the custom immersive space doesn’t appear.\n\n### Add an immersive scene-viewing option to your video player\n\nCreate an immersive picker view that toggles the immersive scene through existing immersive space APIs.\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/immersiveEnvironmentPicker(content:)] to include this picker as an option in the list of immersive scene selections.\n\n\n\n### Create a docking-region component with a docking entity\n\nThe Immersive Environment App template comes with a Reality Composer Pro project that includes a `Player` entity with the docking region. To customize the docking-region settings in Xcode, open the Reality Composer Pro package and remove the `Video_Dock` entity that contains the `Player` entity.\n\nWithin your `ImmersiveView`, create a docking-region component with a width of your choice. The docking region uses a cinematic `2.4:1` width-height ratio to determine the height.\n\nCreate a docking entity and position the entity where you want to dock the AV player. Then attach the docking-region component to the docking entity.\n\nAnd, finally, add it to your `RealityView`.\n\n",
