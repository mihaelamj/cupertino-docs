The pre-processing step can take significant time if the position counts are large. To minimize this cost, the position count should be as small as possible. The returned `ShapeResource` can only be used under the following circumstances:\n\n- This shape can only be used with `PhysicsBodyMode.static` and not `.dynamic` or `.kinematic`.\n- This shape cannot be used with `CollisionComponent.Mode.trigger`.\n\n",
