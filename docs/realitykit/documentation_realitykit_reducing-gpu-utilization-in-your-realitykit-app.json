For example, the framework automatically generates and uses *mipmaps*, which are a series of progressively lower resolution variants of your texture that improve render times when applied to distant objects.\n\n\n\nYou can take additional steps to minimize memory consumption and reduce GPU utilization:\n\nReducing texture information also helps to reduce your app’s memory footprint. To estimate the amount of memory an uncompressed texture consumes in bytes, use the following formula:\n\nThe `channels` parameter indicates the number of color channels in the texture. The `width` times the `height` counts total pixels in each channel. The factor of `4\/3` accounts for the lower resolution variants added by the mipmapping that RealityKit automatically performs.\n\nFor example, a texture describing a base color with four channels — one for each of red, green, blue, and alpha — stored in a usdz file as a PNG with dimensions of 2048 px × 2048 px consumes a little more than 22 MB.\n\n### Maintain a modest polygon count\n\nOne way to reduce the complexity of the render is to selectively reduce the polygon count of your models. Reserve high complexity for the models, or parts of models, that the user is likely to examine most closely. Reduce the complexity of background models, or regions of lesser importance.\n\nA reduced polygon count can be especially helpful if you have a lot of shadows in the scene.\n\n### Choose render effects carefully\n\nPolygon count doesn’t affect the time needed for effects like depth of field or motion blur.

However, your design decisions affect whether your app tries to use more than the available GPU capacity.

For example, the framework automatically generates and uses *mipmaps*, which are a series of progressively lower resolution variants of your texture that improve render times when applied to distant objects.\n\n\n\nYou can take additional steps to minimize memory consumption and reduce GPU utilization:\n\n- Use the smallest texture that still produces visually appealing results. Textures rendered on an iPhone or an iPad don’t need more than about 2048 pixels on a side. Also, it’s typically most efficient to use sizes that are powers of 2.\n- Combine multiple textures into a single texture atlas, where possible. Having fewer individual texture files helps to reduce memory consumption.\n- Use multiple textures of varying sizes to cover a mesh that doesn’t require maximum resolution everywhere.\n\nReducing texture information also helps to reduce your app’s memory footprint. To estimate the amount of memory an uncompressed texture consumes in bytes, use the following formula:\n\n```swift\nmemory = channels × width × height × 4\/3\n```\n\nThe `channels` parameter indicates the number of color channels in the texture. The `width` times the `height` counts total pixels in each channel. The factor of `4\/3` accounts for the lower resolution variants added by the mipmapping that RealityKit automatically performs.\n\nFor example, a texture describing a base color with four channels — one for each of red, green, blue, and alpha — stored in a usdz file as a PNG with dimensions of 2048 px × 2048 px consumes a little more than 22 MB.\n\n### Maintain a modest polygon count\n\nOne way to reduce the complexity of the render is to selectively reduce the polygon count of your models.
