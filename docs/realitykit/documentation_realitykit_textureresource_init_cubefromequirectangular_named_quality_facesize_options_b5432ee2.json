The name is empty if you don’t include one.\n- **quality**: The sampling quality the initializer applies as it generates the cube texture.\n- **faceSize**: The dimension of a cube face. When `faceSize` is `nil`, RealityKit computes the size based on the equirectangular image’s dimensions. RealityKit clamps the value to the source image’s height. For best results, pass values that are one-third of the cubeʻs width or less.\n- **options**: A configuration for generating the texture.\n\n## Discussion\n\nRealityKit samples the source equirectangular image at the specified quality level to generate the cube texture.\n\nThe equirectangular image, also known as a *latitude-longitude image*, contains a flattened map of the surroundings where:\n\n- The width is a `360°` clockwise scan along the horizon, starting from behind (+z-axis)\n- The height is a -90° (bottom) to +90° (top) vertical scan\n\nTo preserve all details equirectangular images require a `2:1` aspect ratio.\n\n\n\nUse the resulting texture to create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/EnvironmentResource], or assign it to a material in Reality Composer Pro that requires a cube texture type.\n\n```swift\nif let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as CFURL, nil),\n    let image = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(source, 0, nil) {\n\n    \/\/ Create a cube texture from the image.\n    let cube = try await TextureResource(\n        cubeFromEquirectangular: image, quality: .normal,\n        options: TextureResource.CreateOptions(semantic: .hdrColor))\n\n    \/\/ Create an environment resource from the cube texture.\n    let environment = try await EnvironmentResource(\n        cube: cube, options: EnvironmentResource.CreateOptions())\n\n    await MainActor.run {\n        \/\/ Assign the environment to an image-based light component.\n        let lightEntity = Entity()\n        lightEntity.components.set(\n            ImageBasedLightComponent(source: .single(environment)))\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n",
