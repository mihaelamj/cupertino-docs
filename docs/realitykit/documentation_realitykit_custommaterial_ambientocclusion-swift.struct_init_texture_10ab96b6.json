This function creates a new ambient occlusion object from a UV-mapped image texture.\n\nSpecify ambient occlusion by using a UV-mapped image called an *ambient occlusion map*. A value of black (`0.0`) represents parts of the model that receive less ambient light because that part of the model is a crevice, dent, or recessed area, or because another part of the same entity is preventing ambient light from reaching it. Ambient occlusion values of white (`1.0`) represent flat portions of the model that receive full ambient light. You generate ambient occlusion maps by using a 3D software package.\n\nThe ambient occlusion texture is available in the material’s surface shader, but RealityKit doesn’t render ambient occlusion unless the surface shader calls `params.surface().set_ambient_occlusion()`.\n\nThe following Metal code shows how to use the ambient occlusion texture in a surface shader function:",
