RealityKit is an AR-first 3D framework that leverages [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ARKit] to seamlessly integrate virtual objects into the real world.\n\n\n\nUse RealityKit’s rich functionality to create compelling augmented reality (AR) experiences:\n\n- Create and import full RealityKit scenes with models, animations, and Spatial Audio by using Reality Composer Pro for visionOS.\n- Build or modify scenes at runtime by adding 3D models, shape primitives, and sounds from code.\n- Have virtual objects interact with objects in the real world.\n- Animate objects, both manually and with physics simulations.\n- Respond to user input and changes in a person’s surroundings.\n- Synchronize across devices and use SharePlay to enable group AR experiences.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Understanding the modular architecture of RealityKit**: Learn how everything fits together in RealityKit.\n- **Building an immersive experience with RealityKit**: Use systems and postprocessing effects to create a realistic underwater scene.\n- **Entity**: An element of a RealityKit scene to which you attach components that provide appearance and behavior characteristics for the entity.\n- **Component**: A representation of a geometry or a behavior that you apply to an entity.\n\n## Presentation\n\n- **Views and attachments**: Bring RealityKit content into your app with views and renderers.\n- **Presentation UI**: Control your app’s content and how people can interact with it.\n\n## Scene management and logic\n\n- **Scenes**: The context that holds all RealityKit entities.\n- **Systems**: Apply behaviors and physical effects to the entities in a RealityKit scene.\n- **Events**: Respond to things happening in your RealityKit scene by subscribing to specific event types.\n- **Entity actions**: Create simple, reusable actions that can change your app state, RealityKit scene, or animate an entity.\n\n## Asset creation\n\n- **Swift Splash**: Use RealityKit to create an interactive ride in visionOS.\n- **Diorama**: Design scenes for your visionOS app using Reality Composer Pro.\n- **Composing interactive 3D content with RealityKit and Reality Composer Pro**: Build an interactive scene using an animation timeline.\n- **Presenting an artist’s scene**: Display a scene from Reality Composer Pro in visionOS.\n- **Reality Composer**: A visual editor for RealityKit AR scenes.\n- **Object capture**: Create 3D objects from a series of photographs using photogrammetry.\n- **USD**: An efficient and scalable way to represent 3D scenes.\n\n## Scene content\n\n- **Hello World**: Use windows, volumes, and immersive spaces to teach people about the Earth.\n- **Enabling video reflections in an immersive environment**: Create a more immersive experience by adding video reflections in a custom environment.\n- **Creating a spatial drawing app with RealityKit**: Use low-level mesh and texture APIs to achieve fast updates to a person’s brush strokes by integrating RealityKit with ARKit and SwiftUI.\n- **Generating interactive geometry with RealityKit**: Create an interactive mesh with low-level mesh and low-level texture.\n- **Combining 2D and 3D views in an immersive app**: Use attachments to place 2D content relative to 3D content in your visionOS app.\n- **Transforming RealityKit entities using gestures**: Build a RealityKit component to support standard visionOS gestures on any entity.\n- **Responding to gestures on an entity**: Respond to gestures performed on RealityKit entities using input target and collision components.\n- **Models and meshes**: Display virtual objects in your scene with mesh-based models.\n- **Materials, textures, and shaders**: Apply textures to the surface of your scene’s 3D objects to give each object a unique appearance.\n- **Anchors**: Lock virtual content to the real world.\n- **Lights and cameras**: Control the lighting and point of view for a scene.\n- **Content synchronization**: Synchronize the contents of entities locally or across the network.\n- **Audio**: Create personalized and realistic spatial audio experiences.\n- **Videos**: Present videos in your RealityKit experiences.\n- **Images**: Present images and spatial scenes in your RealityKit experiences.\n\n## Game development\n\n- **Gaming sample code projects**: Explore a collection of projects relating to game development.\n- **Entity animations**: Dynamically move, rotate, and scale entities at runtime.\n- **Character control, skeletons, and inverse kinematics**: Direct the movements and animation of models.\n\n## Physics simulation\n\n- **Collision detection**: Determine when entities collide with each other or the environment.\n- **Simulations and motion**: Simulate physical interactions between entities or systems.\n- **Force effects**: Control the movement of virtual objects with forces.\n- **Physics joints and pins**: Simulate joint physics that connect virtual objects.\n\n## Performance improvements\n\n- **Improving the Performance of a RealityKit App**: Measure CPU and GPU utilization to find ways to improve your app’s performance.\n- **Reducing GPU Utilization in Your RealityKit App**: Prevent the GPU from limiting your app’s frame rate by reducing the complexity of your render.\n- **Reducing CPU Utilization in Your RealityKit App**: Target specific CPU metrics with adjustments to your app and its content.\n- **Construct an immersive environment for visionOS**: Build efficient custom worlds for your app.\n- **Passing Metal command objects around your application**: Build a system that creates and passes Metal command objects to entities dispatching Metal compute shaders.\n- **Resource**: A shared resource you use to configure a component, like a material, mesh, or texture.\n\n## Articles\n\n- **Rendering stereoscopic video with RealityKit**: Render stereoscopic video in visionOS with RealityKit.\n\n",
