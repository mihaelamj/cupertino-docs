Use a group to:\n\n- Animate more than one property at once.\n- Animate the same property at different times.\n\n### Animate multiple properties concurrently\n\nFor each animatable property your animation needs to control, create a group and add an animation to the array argument of the initializer. The following listing begins coding an animation group that colorizes 3D numbers that count down over a 4-second duration.\n\n```swift\nlet frames: [Float] = [3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.0]\nlet duration = TimeInterval(frames.count)\nlet anim1 = FromToByAnimation<Float>(name: \"colorize\", from: 0.0, to: 1.0,\n    duration: duration, bindTarget: .parameter(\"foo\"))\nlet anim2 = SampledAnimation<Float>(frames: frames, name: \"count down\",\n    frameInterval: duration \/ frames.count, bindTarget: .parameter(\"bar\"))\nlet group = AnimationGroup(group: [anim1, anim2], name: \"group\")\n```\n\n### Create a sequence for the same animation\n\nYou can play the same animation at different times by grouping multiple [doc:\/\/com.apple.RealityKit\/documentation\/RealityKit\/AnimationDefinition] objects that refer to the same animated property.
