The coordinate system’s positive y-axis is assumed to be the normal of the plane.\n- **relativeToCamera**: If the plane transform is relative to camera space or world space.\n\n## Return Value\n\n3D position in world coordinates or nil if unprojection is not possible.\n\n## Discussion\n\nA 2D point in the view’s coordinate space can refer to any point along a line segment in the 3D coordinate space. Unprojecting gets the 3D position of the point along this line segment that intersects the provided plane.\n\n## Mapping between coordinate spaces\n\n- **project(_:)**: Projects a point from the 3D world coordinate system of the scene to the 2D pixel coordinate system of the view.\n- **unproject(_:ontoPlane:)**: Maps a 2D point from the view’s coordinate system onto the given plane in 3D space.\n- **unproject(_:viewport:)**: Maps a 2D point from the pixel coordinate system of a viewport into a 3D coordinate space. The point lies on this view’s near clipping plane.\n- **ray(through:)**: Determines the position and direction of a ray through the given point in the 2D space of the view.\n\n",
