The App Clip Code offers a fast and secure launch experience for your App Clip that users trust.\n\n\n\nThe visual design of an App Clip Code encodes your App Clip’s *invocation URL*. Optionally, you can embed an NFC tag that also encodes the invocation URL. An App Clip Code with an embedded NFC tag is called an *NFC-integrated* App Clip Code, while a code without an NFC tag is called a *scan-only* App Clip Code.\n\nThe image at the center of an App Clip Code icon lets users know how to interact with the code. If they discover an NFC-integrated App Clip Code, they hold their device close to the code or scan it with the NFC Tag Reader in Control Center to launch your App Clip. They can also scan an NFC-integrated App Clip Code with the Camera app or the Code Scanner in Control Center. If they discover a scan-only App Clip Code, they scan it with the Camera or the Code Scanner in Control Center to launch your App Clip.\n\nIn addition to providing a great launch experience for your App Clip, you can also use an App Clip Code to offer a context-aware augmented reality experience.

For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appclip\/documentation\/AppClip\/interacting-with-app-clip-codes-in-ar].\n\n\n\nCreating an App Clip Code requires the following tasks:\n\n1. Choosing an invocation URL and configuring an *advanced App Clip experience* in [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/login]. To learn more, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appclip\/documentation\/AppClip\/configuring-the-launch-experience-of-your-app-clip].\n2. Choosing the type (scan-only or NFC-integrated), colors, and design of your App Clip Code. For design guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/app-clips\/overview\/app-clip-codes\/].\n3. Generating App Clip Codes with App Store Connect or with the App Clip Code Generator command-line tool. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appclip\/documentation\/AppClip\/creating-app-clip-codes#Pick-a-tool-to-create-App-Clip-Codes] below.\n4. Printing App Clip Codes yourself or with the help of a professional printing service — for example, [https:\/\/touchless.acc.rrd.com\/]. For printing guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/app-clips\/overview\/printing-guidelines\/] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appclip\/documentation\/AppClip\/preparing-multiple-app-clip-codes-for-production].\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appclip\/documentation\/AppClip\/encoding-a-url-in-an-app-clip-code].\n\n### Pick a tool to create App Clip Codes\n\nApp Clip Codes always use the design Apple provides to ensure users instantly recognize them.

Both have similar features and it’s up to you to pick the tool that best fits your needs.\n\nConsider using App Store Connect if:\n\n- You’ve already created an advanced App Clip experience in App Store Connect.\n- You prefer an instantaneous preview while you experiment with colors.\n- You’re comfortable using a tool that offers a more visual interface compared to a command-line tool.\n\nConsider using the App Clip Code Generator command-line tool if:\n\n- You haven’t created an advanced App Clip experience in App Store Connect — for example, during development of your App Clip.\n- You need to create a lot of App Clip Codes and want to automate their creation with a script.\n- You’re comfortable using a command-line tool.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appclip\/documentation\/AppClip\/creating-app-clip-codes-with-app-store-connect] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appclip\/documentation\/AppClip\/creating-app-clip-codes-with-the-app-clip-code-generator].\n\n\n\n## App Clip Code creation\n\n- **Creating App Clip Codes with App Store Connect**: Select one or more advanced App Clip experiences in App Store Connect and create App Clip Codes for users to scan to launch your App Clip.\n- **Creating App Clip Codes with the App Clip Code Generator**: Use the App Clip Code Generator command-line tool to verify your code’s colors, get color suggestions, and create App Clip Codes.\n\n## App Clip Codes\n\n- **Encoding a URL in an App Clip Code**: Choose an invocation URL for your App Clip Code that you can encode efficiently.\n- **Preparing multiple App Clip Codes for production**: Prepare your App Clip Codes to send to a professional printing service.\n- **Interacting with App Clip Codes in AR**: Display content and provide services in an AR experience with App Clip Codes.\n\n",
