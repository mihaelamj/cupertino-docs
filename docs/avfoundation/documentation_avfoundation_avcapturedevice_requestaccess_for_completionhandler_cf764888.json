An app’s default authorization status is [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVAuthorizationStatus\/notDetermined], which means the user hasn’t yet granted it permission to capture media. The first time you create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDeviceInput] object for a media type that requires permission, the system automatically displays an alert to request recording permission. Alternatively, call this method to prompt the user at a time of your choosing. The system saves the user’s selection so that it doesn’t have to prompt the user again. A user can change their authorization status in the Settings app.\n\nCalling this method doesn’t block the thread while the system is prompting the user for access. However, until the grants permission, the system only vends black video frames and silent audio samples.",
