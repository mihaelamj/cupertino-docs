In either case, apps are not allowed to store or use the FairPlay anonymized device ID for anything other than to enforce business rule limits. App developers must use the AppTrackingTransparency framework to disclose to users if the application or the related FairPlay Key Server collect data about end users and share it with other companies for purposes of tracking across apps and web sites.
