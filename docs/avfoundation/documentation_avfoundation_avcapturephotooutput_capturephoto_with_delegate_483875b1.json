This method copies the provided [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings] object, so future changes to that object do not affect the capture in progress.\n\n\n- **delegate**: A delegate object to receive messages about capture progress and results. The photo output calls your delegate methods as the photo advances from capture to processing to delivery of finished images.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method for all variations of still photography, including single photo capture,  RAW format capture (with or without a secondary format such as JPEG), bracketed capture of multiple images, and Live Photo capture.\n\nWhen you call this method, the photo output validates the properties of your `settings` object to ensure deterministic behavior.
