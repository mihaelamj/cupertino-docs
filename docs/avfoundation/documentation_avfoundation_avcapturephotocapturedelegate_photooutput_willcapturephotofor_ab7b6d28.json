Match this object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/uniqueID] value to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/uniqueID] property of the photo settings object you initiated capture with to determine which capture request this delegate call corresponds to. You can also use this object to find out which values the photo output has chosen for automatic settings.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe photo output calls this method as close as possible to the initial moment of capture. If the shutter sound is enabled, this call occurs immediately after the photo output begins playing the shutter sound.\n\n\n\n## Monitoring capture progress\n\n- **photoOutput(_:willBeginCaptureFor:)**: Notifies the delegate that the capture output has resolved settings and will soon begin its capture process.\n- **photoOutput(_:didCapturePhotoFor:)**: Notifies the delegate that the photo has been taken.\n- **photoOutput(_:didFinishCaptureFor:error:)**: Notifies the delegate that the capture process is complete.\n\n",
