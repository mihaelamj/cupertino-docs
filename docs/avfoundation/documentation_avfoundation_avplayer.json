This object models the timing and presentation state of an asset played by an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer]. See the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem] reference for more details.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer] is a dynamic object whose state continuously changes. There are two approaches you can use to observe a player’s state:\n\n- **General State Observations:** You can use key-value observing (KVO) to observe state changes to many of the player’s dynamic properties, such as its [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer\/currentItem] or its playback [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer\/rate].\n- **Timed State Observations:** KVO works well for general state observations, but isn’t intended for observing continuously changing state like the player’s time. [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer] provides two methods to observe time changes:\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer\/addPeriodicTimeObserver(forInterval:queue:using:)]\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer\/addBoundaryTimeObserver(forTimes:queue:using:)]\n\nThese methods let you observe time changes either periodically or by boundary, respectively. As changes occur, invoke the callback block or closure you supply to these methods to give you the opportunity to take some action such as updating the state of your player’s user interface.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem] are nonvisual objects, meaning that on their own they’re unable to present an asset’s video onscreen. There are two primary approaches you use to present your video content onscreen:\n\n- **AVKit:** The best way to present your video content is with the AVKit framework’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController] class in iOS and tvOS, or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerView] class in macOS. These classes present the video content, along with playback controls and other media features giving you a full-featured playback experience.\n- **AVPlayerLayer:** When building a custom interface for your player, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerLayer]. You can set this layer a view’s backing layer or add it directly to the layer hierarchy. Unlike [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerView] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController], a player layer doesn’t present any playback controls—it only presents the visual content onscreen. It’s up to you to build the playback transport controls to play, pause, and seek through the media.\n\nAlongside the visual content presented with AVKit or [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerLayer], you can also present animated content synchronized with the player’s timing using [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVSynchronizedLayer]. Use a synchronized layer pass along player timing to its layer subtree. You can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVSynchronizedLayer] to build custom effects in Core Animation, such as animated lower thirds or video transitions, and have them play in sync with the timing of the player’s current [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem].\n\n## Creating a player\n\n- **init(url:)**: Creates a new player
