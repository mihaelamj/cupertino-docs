When the value is greater than `1.0`, the capture session can’t run in its current configuration due to hardware constraints. Attempting to start the session while it’s in this state results in a runtime error.\n\nFactors that contribute to the hardware cost include:\n\n- The active formats of the source devices. Some formats use the full sensor (4:3) and others a crop (16:9). Cropped formats require lower hardware bandwidth, and therefore lower the cost.\n- The maximum frame rate of the source devices’ active formats. The hardware cost increases when using high frame rates.\n- Whether the source devices uses binned formats. Binned formats require substantially less hardware bandwidth, and therefore result in a lower cost.\n- The number of sources configured to deliver streaming disparity and depth using [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDepthDataOutput]. The higher the number of cameras configured to produce depth, the higher the cost.\n\nTo reduce the hardware cost, consider picking a sensor-cropped or binned [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/activeFormat].
