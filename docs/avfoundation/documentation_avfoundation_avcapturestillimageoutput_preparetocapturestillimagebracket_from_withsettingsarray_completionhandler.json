All the array items must be of the same [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureBracketedStillImageSettings] subclass, or an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSExceptionName\/invalidArgumentException] exception is thrown.\n- **handler**: A user provided block that will be called asynchronously once resources have successfully been allocated for the specified bracketed capture operation.\n\nThe block has two parameters:\n\n\n\nIf the count of the `settings` parameter exceeds [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureStillImageOutput\/maxBracketedCaptureStillImageCount], then `AVErrorMaximumStillImageCaptureRequestsExceeded` is returned.\n\nYou should not assume that the completion handler will be called on a specific thread.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore taking a still image bracket, additional resources may need to be allocated. By calling this method first, you are able to know when the receiver is ready to capture the bracket with the specified settings array.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **captureStillImageAsynchronously(from:completionHandler:)**: Initiates a still image capture and returns immediately.\n\n## Still image bracketed capture\n\n- **captureStillImageBracketAsynchronously(from:withSettingsArray:completionHandler:)**: Captures a still image bracket.\n- **maxBracketedCaptureStillImageCount**: Specifies the maximum number of still images that may be taken in a single bracket.\n- **isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureSupported**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the capture output supports lens stabilization across the duration of a bracketed capture.\n- **isLensStabilizationDuringBracketedCaptureEnabled**: A Boolean value that specifies whether to stabilize the lens across the duration of a bracketed capture.\n\n",
