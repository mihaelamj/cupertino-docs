If a device format has no [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/Format\/supportedDepthDataFormats], the value of this property is an empty array.\n\nThe presence of one or more ranges where the minimum and maximum zoom factors aren’t equal means the system supports continuous zoom with depth. For example, if the value of this property contains the closed ranges `2...2` and `4...4`, the system only allows you to set zoom factors 2 and 4 when you enable depth data delivery. Setting a zoom factor outside these ranges results in an exception. Alternatively, a closed range of `2...5` indicates the system supports depth data delivery with zoom factors from 2 to 5. You can set a zoom factor outside this range, but results in a loss of depth data. Setting the zoom factor back to the supported range resumes depth data delivery.\n\nWhen you enable depth data delivery, the effective [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/Format\/videoZoomFactorUpscaleThreshold] is `1.0`, which means that all zoom factors that aren’t native zoom factors (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/virtualDeviceSwitchOverVideoZoomFactors] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/Format\/secondaryNativeResolutionZoomFactors]) result in digital upscaling.",
