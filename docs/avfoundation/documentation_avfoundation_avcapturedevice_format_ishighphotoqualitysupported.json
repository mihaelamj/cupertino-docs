For maximum backward compatibility, photo requests on high photo quality formats only cause video frame drops if your app links against iOS 15 or later.\n\nFormats that don’t support high photo quality produce the same image quality regardless of the current [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/photoQualityPrioritization] setting.\n\n## Determining photo quality\n\n- **supportedMaxPhotoDimensions**: The maximum photo dimension this format supports.\n- **isHighestPhotoQualitySupported**: A Boolean value that indicates whether this format supports the highest photo quality that the platform delivers.\n\n",
