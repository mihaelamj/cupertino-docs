If no language setting pertains, can be nil.\n- **settings**: A collection of AVMediaPresentationSettings provided by selectors of the receiver other than the specified selector. Because no two AVMediaPresentationSettings of the same AVMediaPresentationSelector are complementary, an empty array will be returned if you specify more than one setting for any selector.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the content is authored to provide a collection of AVMediaSelectionOptions that include one or more with all of the combinations of media characteristics of the specified AVMediaPresentationSettings together with all of the settings of the specified AVMediaPresentationSelector, this method will return all of the settings for that selector.
