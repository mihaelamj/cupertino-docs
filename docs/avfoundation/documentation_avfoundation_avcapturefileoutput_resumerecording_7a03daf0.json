This allows you to record multiple media segments that are not contiguous in time to a single file.\n\nIn macOS, if this method is called within the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: delegate method, the first samples written to the current file are guaranteed to be those contained in the sample buffer passed to        that method.",
