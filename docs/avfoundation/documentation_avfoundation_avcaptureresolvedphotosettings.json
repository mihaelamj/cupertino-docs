  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen you request a photo capture using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoOutput] [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoOutput\/capturePhoto(with:delegate:)] method, you describe the settings for that capture request in an [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings] object. When the capture begins, the photo output calls your delegate methods and provides an [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings] object detailing the settings that are in effect for that capture. Resolved photo settings objects are immutable; they describe a request that has already been made.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings\/uniqueID] property of a resolved photo settings object passed to one of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate] methods matches the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/uniqueID] value of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings] object you passed when requesting capture. Use this value to determine which delegate method calls correspond to which capture requests.\n\nSome photo capture settings are automatic, such as the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/flashMode] property. For such settings, the photo output determines whether to use that feature at the moment of capture—you don’t know when requesting a capture whether the feature is active when the capture completes. When the photo output calls your delegate methods, the provided [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings] object details which automatic features have been set for that capture.\n\nLikewise, the dimensions of an output image or movie may not be set until the moment of capture. For example, when you specify a thumbnail size with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/previewPhotoFormat] setting, the photo output chooses dimensions that best match your requested size while preserving the aspect ratio of the captured photo. When the photo output calls your delegate methods, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureResolvedPhotoSettings\/previewDimensions] property of the resolved settings to find the actual preview image dimensions. See the methods listed in Examining Output Dimensions for other cases where output dimensions can change at capture time.",
