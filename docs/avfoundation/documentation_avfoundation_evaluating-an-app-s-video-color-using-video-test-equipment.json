Verify the gamma, quantization errors, and range expansion or compression.\n\nThe following are elements of the QuickTime Test Pattern movie file to examine on a waveform monitor:\n\n- Black boxes on a black background. A test signal on the waveform monitor visible as 16 steps beginning with true black (row A in the figure above).\n- Gradient. A monotonically increasing gradient that includes super-whites and super-blacks. You should expect rendering processes that include full-range RGB to crush such a gradient (row B in figure above). The result on the waveform monitor should range from true-black to full-white. However, you may see clamping of the beginning and end of the repeating pattern to black or white for the extent of the range corresponding to super-white and super-black. The gradient should form a straight line on the waveform monitor’s display (otherwise it indicates a gamma conversion). Any uneven lines on the display indicate the effects of quantization.\n- White boxes on a full-white background. On the waveform monitor, this portion of the test signal should be visible as 16 steps beginning from full-white (row F in the figure above).\n- Quantized gradient. The waveform monitor plots the area under those targets for the gamma of the signal (row E in the figure above).\n\n## Video evaluation\n\n- **Evaluating video using QuickTime test pattern files**: Check color reproduction of your app or workflow by using test pattern files.\n- **Evaluating an app’s video color using light-measurement Instruments**: Measure front-of-screen luminance by using test pattern files with a spectroradiometer or colorimeter.\n\n",
