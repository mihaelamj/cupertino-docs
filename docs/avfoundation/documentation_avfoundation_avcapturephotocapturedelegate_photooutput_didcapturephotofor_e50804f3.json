Match this object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/uniqueID] value to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/uniqueID] property of the photo settings object you initiated capture with to determine which capture request this delegate call corresponds to. You can also use this object to find out which values the photo output has chosen for automatic settings.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe photo output calls this method as soon as the first step of capture ends—that is, at the end of the photographic exposure time.\n\n## Monitoring capture progress\n\n- **photoOutput(_:willBeginCaptureFor:)**: Notifies the delegate that the capture output has resolved settings and will soon begin its capture process.\n- **photoOutput(_:willCapturePhotoFor:)**: Notifies the delegate that photo capture is about to occur.\n- **photoOutput(_:didFinishCaptureFor:error:)**: Notifies the delegate that the capture process is complete.\n\n",
