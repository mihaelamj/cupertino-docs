The system raises an exception if you pass an empty array.\n- **queue**: A *serial* queue onto which `block` should be enqueued. Passing a concurrent queue is not supported and will result in undefined behavior.\n\nIf you pass `nil`, the main queue is used.\n- **block**: The block to be invoked when any of the times in `times` is crossed during normal playback.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn opaque object that you pass as the argument to [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer\/removeTimeObserver(_:)] to stop observation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBoundary times are arbitrary points of interest you define within the media timeline. As these times are traversed during normal playback, the block you provide to this method will be invoked.
