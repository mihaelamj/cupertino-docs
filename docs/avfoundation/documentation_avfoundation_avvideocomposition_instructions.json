For subsequent instructions, `timeRange.start` must be equal to the prior instruction’s end time. The end time of the last instruction must be greater than or equal to the latest time for which playback or other processing will be attempted (typically be the duration of the asset with which the instance of `AVVideoComposition` is associated).",
