An asset writer automatically supports interleaving media data from concurrent tracks for efficient playback and storage. It can reencode media samples it writes to the output file, and may also write collections of metadata to the output file.\n\n\n\n## Creating an asset writer\n\n- **init(url:fileType:)**: Returns a new object that writes media data to a container file at the output URL.\n- **init(outputURL:fileType:)**: Creates an object that writes media data to a container file at the output URL.\n- **init(contentType:)**: Creates an object that outputs segment data in a specified container format.\n\n## Configuring inputs\n\n- **inputs**: The inputs an asset writer contains.\n- **availableMediaTypes**: The media types the asset writer supports adding as inputs.\n- **canApply(outputSettings:forMediaType:)**: Determines whether the output file format supports the output settings for a specific media type.\n- **canAdd(_:)**: Determines whether the asset writer supports adding the input.\n- **add(_:)**: Adds an input to an asset writer.\n\n## Configuring input receivers\n\n- **inputReceiver(for:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns an input receiver for writing sample buffers.\n- **inputCaptionReceiver(for:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns an input receiver for writing caption data.\n- **inputCaptionReceiverRequestingMultiPass(for:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns a tuple with an input receiver for writing

**inputMetadataReceiverRequestingMultiPass(for:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns a tuple with an input receiver for writing timed metadata group, and an associated multi pass controller.\n- **inputPixelBufferReceiver(for:pixelBufferAttributes:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns an input receiver for writing pixel buffers.\n- **inputPixelBufferReceiverRequestingMultiPass(for:pixelBufferAttributes:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns a tuple with an input receiver for writing pixel buffers, and an associated multi pass controller.\n- **inputReceiverRequestingMultiPass(for:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns a tuple with an input receiver for writing sample buffers, and an associated multi pass controller.\n- **inputTaggedPixelBufferGroupReceiver(for:pixelBufferAttributes:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns an input receiver for writing tagged pixel buffers.\n- **inputTaggedPixelBufferGroupReceiverRequestingMultiPass(for:pixelBufferAttributes:)**: Attaches the input to the writer and returns a tuple with an input receiver for writing tagged pixel buffers, and an associated multi pass controller.\n\n## Configuring input groups\n\n- **inputGroups**: The input groups an asset writer contains.\n- **canAdd(_:)**: Determines whether the asset writer supports adding the input group.\n- **add(_:)**: Adds an input group to an asset writer.\n\n## Configuring output\n\n- **metadata**: An array of metadata items to write to the output file.\n- **shouldOptimizeForNetworkUse**: A Boolean value that indicates whether to write the output file to make it more suitable for playback over a network.\n- **directoryForTemporaryFiles**: A directory to contain temporary files that the export process generates.\n\n## Configuring fragment output\n\n- **movieFragmentInterval**: The interval at which to write movie fragments.\n-
