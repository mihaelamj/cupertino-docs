If this method is invoked while an existing output file was already being recorded, no media samples will be discarded between the old file and the new file.\n\nWhen recording is stopped—by calling `stopRecording`, by changing files using this method, or because of an error—the remaining data that needs to be included to the file will be written in the background. Therefore, you must specify a delegate that will be notified when all data has been written to the file using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureFileOutputRecordingDelegate\/fileOutput(_:didFinishRecordingTo:from:error:)] method. The recording delegate can also optionally implement methods that inform it when data starts being written, when recording is paused and resumed, and when recording is about to be finished.\n\nIn macOS, if this method is called within the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureAudioDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate\/captureOutput(_:didOutput:from:)] delegate method, the first samples written to the new file are guaranteed to be those contained in the sample buffer passed to that method.",
