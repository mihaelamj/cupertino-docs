The value of this characteristic is @“public.machine-generated”.\n\nNote for content authors: for QuickTime movie and .m4v files and for HTTP Live Streaming, a media option is considered to have the characteristic AVMediaCharacteristicIsOriginalContent only if it’s explicitly tagged with the characteristic.
