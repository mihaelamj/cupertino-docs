The most common form of navigation marker group is a chapter list; however, you can also provide other sets of markers to allow a user to jump to significant events in the presentation. For example, a “Goals Scored” marker group might summarize key moments in a recorded sporting event. When you present a player item containing marker groups with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController] class, the user interface provides options for navigating each group.\n\nTo provide a chapter list, use the first item in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem\/navigationMarkerGroups] array and set its title property to `nil`. To provide additional or alternate means of navigating content, use a unique title value for each navigation marker group in the array.",
