Edit the shared scheme called `fmp4Writer`.\n2. Open the Run action.\n3. Replace the *<path to movie file on disk>* argument with the path to a movie file on your local hard drive.\n4. Replace the *<path to output directory>* argument  with your desired output directory; for example `~\/Desktop\/fmp4writer\/`.\n\n## Media writing\n\n- **Converting projected video to Apple Projected Media Profile**: Convert content with equirectangular or half-equirectangular projection to APMP.\n- **Converting side-by-side 3D video to multiview HEVC and spatial video**: Create video content for visionOS by converting an existing 3D HEVC file to a multiview HEVC format, optionally adding spatial metadata to create a spatial video.\n- **Creating spatial photos and videos with spatial metadata**: Add spatial metadata to stereo photos and videos to create spatial media for viewing on Apple Vision Pro.\n- **Tagging media with video color information**: Inspect and set video color space information when writing and transcoding media.\n- **Evaluating an app’s video color**: Check color reproduction for a video in your app by using test patterns, video test equipment, and light-measurement instruments.\n- **AVOutputSettingsAssistant**: An object that builds audio and video output settings dictionaries.\n- **AVAssetWriter**: An object that writes media data to a container file.\n- **AVAssetWriterInput**: An object that appends media samples to a track in an asset writer’s output file.\n- **AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor**: An object that appends video samples to an asset writer input.\n- **AVAssetWriterInputTaggedPixelBufferGroupAdaptor**: An object that appends tagged buffer groups to an asset writer input.\n- **AVAssetWriterInputMetadataAdaptor**: An object that appends timed metadata groups to an asset writer input.\n- **AVAssetWriterInputGroup**: A group of inputs with tracks that are mutually exclusive to each other for playback or processing.\n\n",
