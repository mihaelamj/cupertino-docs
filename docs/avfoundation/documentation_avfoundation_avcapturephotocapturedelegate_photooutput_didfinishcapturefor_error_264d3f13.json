Match this object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/uniqueID] value to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings\/uniqueID] property of the photo settings object you initiated capture with to determine which capture request this delegate call corresponds to. You can also use this object to find out which values the photo output has chosen for automatic settings.\n- **error**: If the capture process did not complete successfully, an error object describing the failure; otherwise, `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe photo output calls this method when the entire capture process has finished, and no more delegate messages will be sent for this capture request. Use this time to clean up any resources you’ve allocated that relate to this capture request.\n\n## Monitoring capture progress\n\n- **photoOutput(_:willBeginCaptureFor:)**: Notifies the delegate that the capture output has resolved settings and will soon begin its capture process.\n- **photoOutput(_:willCapturePhotoFor:)**: Notifies the delegate that photo capture is about to occur.\n- **photoOutput(_:didCapturePhotoFor:)**: Notifies the delegate that the photo has been taken.\n\n",
