  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis method adjusts the current item’s timebase so that the time in `itemTime` is in sync with the time in `hostClockTime`. Thus, if `hostClockTime` specifies a time in the past, the item’s timebase is adjusted to make it appear as if the item has been running at the specified rate since `itemTime`. And if `hostClockTime` specifies a time in the future, playback is adjusted backward (if possible) so that the value in `itemTime` occurs at the precise moment the host’s clock reaches the value in `hostClockTime`. If there is no content to play before the time specified by `itemTime`, playback holds until the two times come into sync.\n\nThis method does not ensure that media data is loaded before the timebase starts moving. However, if you specify a host time in the near future, that would give you some time to load the media data and prepare for playback.",
