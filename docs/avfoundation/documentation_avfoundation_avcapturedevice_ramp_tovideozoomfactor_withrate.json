The `rate` parameter controls the speed of this transition independent of direction; for example, a value of `1.0` causes zoom factor to double every second if zooming in (that’s, if the specified `factor` is greater than the current [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/videoZoomFactor]) or halve every second if zooming out.\n\nBefore calling this method, you must call [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/lockForConfiguration()] to acquire exclusive access to the device’s configuration properties. If you don’t, calling this method raises an exception.
