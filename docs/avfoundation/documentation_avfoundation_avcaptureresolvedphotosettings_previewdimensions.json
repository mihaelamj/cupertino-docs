Aspect ratio is determined by capture format and by device orientation at the moment of capture.\n\nThis property provides the dimensions of the requested preview image, which is delivered in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate\/photoOutput(_:didFinishProcessingPhoto:error:)] method.
