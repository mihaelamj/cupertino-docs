If unknown, the value is `kCMTimeInvalid`.\n- **frames**: Frame component of the timecode, indicating the frame count within the second.\n- **minutes**: Time component representing the current timecode in minutes.\n- **seconds**: Time component representing the current timecode in seconds.\n- **userBits**: A 32-bit field carrying SMPTE user bits, which are not strictly standardized. User bits are often used for additional metadata such as scene-take information, reel numbers, or dates, but their exact usage is application-dependent.\n\n",
