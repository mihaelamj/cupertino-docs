  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen you build media playback apps for iOS, tvOS, and visionOS, you need to do additional configuration to enable the expected playback behavior. Configuring the audio experience and background operations helps ensure that your app’s audio works as intended. It also enables advanced features like AirPlay streaming and Picture in Picture playback on supported platforms.\n\n### Configure the audio session\n\nApple platforms, other than macOS which primarily leaves control to an app, provide an audio experience that the operating system manages. This enables the OS to provide a seamless audio experience to people as they switch between apps and receive high-priority audio requests such as phone or FaceTime calls.\n\nYour app uses an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession] to configure its audio behavior semantically, for example to have a primary purpose of playback or recording. You delegate the management of those details to the audio session, which ensures that the operating system can best manage a person’s audio experience.\n\nYour app automatically has an audio session that the system configures with this default behavior:\n\nThe default audio session provides useful behavior, but typically doesn’t provide the experience and features you need when building a playback app. To add the required behavior, configure your app’s audio session category.\n\nAn audio session category defines the general audio behavior your app requires. AVFoundation defines several audio session categories you can use, but the one most relevant for media playback apps is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession\/Category-swift.struct\/playback]. This category indicates that media playback is a central feature of your app. When you specify this category, the system doesn’t silence your app’s audio when someone sets the Ring\/Silent switch to silent mode in iOS only. Enabling this category means your app can play background audio if you’re using the Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture background mode as explained in the section below.\n\nUse an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession] object to configure your app’s audio session. An audio session is a singleton object you use to set the audio session [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession\/category-swift.property], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession\/mode-swift.property], and other settings. To configure the audio session for optimized playback of movies:\n\nTo enable this category, activate the audio session using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession\/setActive(_:options:)] method.\n\nSetting the category is the minimal interaction with an audio session, but other configuration options and features are available. For example, in visionOS, you customize a user’s spatial audio experience by configuring the audio session. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession].\n\n### Configure the background modes\n\nThe system requires you to enable certain capabilities to perform some background operations. A common capability that playback apps require is playing background audio. With this capability enabled, your app’s audio continues when people switch to another app or lock their iOS device. Your app also needs this capability to enable advanced playback features like AirPlay streaming and Picture in Picture playback on supported platforms.\n\nUse Xcode to configure this capability:\n\n\n\nWith this mode enabled and your audio session configured, your app is ready to play background audio. In iOS, when you enable this option, your app can stream its content over AirPlay, and in iOS and tvOS it can use Picture in Picture playback.",
