  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nWith Cinematic Video capture, you get a simulated depth-of-field effect that keeps your subjects (people, pets, and more) in sharp focus while applying a pleasing blur to the background (or foreground). Depending on the focus mode (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/CinematicVideoFocusMode] for detail), the camera either uses machine learning to automatically detect and focus on subjects in the scene, or it fixes focus on a subject until it exits the scene. Cinematic Videos can be played back and edited using the Cinematic framework.\n\nYou can adjust the video’s simulated aperture before starting a recording using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDeviceInput\/simulatedAperture] property. With Cinematic Video specific focus methods on [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice], you can dynamically control focus transitions.\n\nMovie files captured with Cinematic Video enabled can be played back and edited with the [Cinematic framework] (https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/cinematic\/playing-and-editing-cinematic-mode-video?language=objc).\n\nThis property returns `true` if the session’s current configuration allows Cinematic Video capture. When switching cameras or formats, this property may change. When this property changes from `true` to `false`, [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDeviceInput\/isCinematicVideoCaptureEnabled] also reverts to `false`.
