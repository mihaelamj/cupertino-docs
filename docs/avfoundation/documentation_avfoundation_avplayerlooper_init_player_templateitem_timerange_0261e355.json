As the player item will only be used as a template, and not for actual playback, any changes you make to the player item after initialization will not be reflected in the replicas. If you need to explicitly configure the replica player items, such as adding instances of [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItemOutput] to them, you can access them through the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerLooper\/loopingPlayerItems] property.\n\nYou should not modify the player’s queue while `AVPlayerLooper` is performing looping playback. If you need to perform any additional configuration of the player prior to playback, you should set its [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer\/rate] to `0.0`, perform the required configuration, and then begin playback once the configuration is complete.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMTimeRange] you specify will limit each item’s loop iteration to playing within the specified time range. To loop the full duration of the asset, specify a time range value of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMTimeRange\/invalid] for the `timeRange` parameter. Time range looping will be accomplished by seeking to the time range’s start time and setting player item’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem\/forwardPlaybackEndTime] property on the looping item replicas.",
