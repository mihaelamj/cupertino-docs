Use the request object in the receiver’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVAssetResourceLoadingRequest\/request] property to get information about the requested resource.\n- **data**: The data of the resource. If no data is available, specify `nil`.\n- **redirect**: When redirecting a resource request, use this parameter to specify the corresponding [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLRequest] object. If you are handling the request and not redirecting it, specify `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen a resource loader’s delegate takes responsibility for loading a resource, it calls this method to indicate that the resource was loaded successfully. This method marks the loading request as finished and returns the provided data back to the resource loader object for processing.\n\n## Reporting the result of the request\n\n- **response**: The URL response for the loading request.\n- **finishLoading()**: Causes the receiver to treat the processing of the request as complete.\n- **isCancelled**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the request has been cancelled.\n- **finishLoading(with:)**: Causes the receiver to handle the failure to load a resource for which a resource loader’s delegate took responsibility.\n- **isFinished**: A Boolean value that indicates whether loading of the resource has finished.\n\n",
