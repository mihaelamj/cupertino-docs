This object is an immutable wrapper from which you can retrieve various results of the photo capture.\n\nIn addition to the photo image pixel buffer, an AVCapturePhoto object can also contain a preview-sized pixel buffer, capture metadata, and, on supported devices, depth data and camera calibration data. From an [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhoto] object, you can generate data appropriate for writing to a file, such as HEVC encoded image data containerized in the HEIC file format and including a preview image, depth data and other attachments.\n\nAn [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhoto] instance wraps a single image result. For example, if you request a bracketed capture of three images, your callback is called three times, each time delivering a single [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhoto] object.",

Color API.\n- **Capturing still and Live Photos**: Configure and capture single or multiple still images, Live Photos, and other forms of photography.\n- **Capturing photos in RAW and Apple ProRAW formats**: Support professional photography workflows by enabling minimally processed image capture in your camera app.\n- **Supporting Continuity Camera in Your Mac App**: Incorporate scanned documents and pictures from a user’s iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch into your Mac app using Continuity Camera.\n- **AVCaptureDeferredPhotoProxy**: A lightly-processed photo with data that the system may
