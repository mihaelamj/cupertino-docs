The frame may be dropped because it was late ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/kCMSampleBufferDroppedFrameReason_FrameWasLate]), typically caused by the client’s processing taking too long. It can also be dropped because the module providing frames is out of buffers ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/kCMSampleBufferDroppedFrameReason_OutOfBuffers]). Frames can also be dropped if the module providing sample buffers has experienced a discontinuity ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/kCMSampleBufferDroppedFrameReason_Discontinuity]) and an unknown number of frames have been lost.  This condition is typically caused by the system being too busy.\n\nBecause this method is called on the same dispatch queue that is responsible for outputting video frames, it must be efficient to prevent further capture performance problems, such as additional dropped video frames.",
