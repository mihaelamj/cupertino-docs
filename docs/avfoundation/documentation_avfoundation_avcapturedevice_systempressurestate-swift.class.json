If during a capture session the total system pressure reaches excessive levels, the capture system automatically shuts down, causing a session interruption (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureSession\/wasInterruptedNotification]). Under less heavy pressure, the system may automatically reduce capture quality.\n\nKey-value observe the capture device’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/systemPressureState-swift.property] property to monitor its state, and take action to reduce the performance impact of your capture session when system pressure increases—for example, by reducing the capture frame rate.",
