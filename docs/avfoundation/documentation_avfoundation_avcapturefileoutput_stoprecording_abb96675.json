If you want to switch from one file to another, you should not call this method. Instead you should simply call [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureFileOutput\/startRecording(to:recordingDelegate:)] with the new file URL.\n\nWhen recording is stopped either by calling this method, by changing files using [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureFileOutput\/startRecording(to:recordingDelegate:)], or because of an error, the remaining data that needs to be included to the file will be written in the background. Therefore, before using the file, you must wait until the delegate that was specified in [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureFileOutput\/startRecording(to:recordingDelegate:)] is notified when all data has been written to the file using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureFileOutputRecordingDelegate\/fileOutput(_:didFinishRecordingTo:from:error:)] method.\n\nIn macOS, if this method is called within the captureOutput:didOutputSampleBuffer:fromConnection: delegate method, the last samples written to the current file are guaranteed to be those that were output immediately before those in the sample buffer passed to that method.",
