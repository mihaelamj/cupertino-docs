  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYou use [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureMovieFileOutput] to capture QuickTime movie files, and the framework chooses the HEVC format by default on most iPhone and iPad models. However, you can change the default format in advance if you know you need a different format.\n\nIf your app shares the captured video using a system share sheet, the system automatically converts the video to a format thatʼs compatible with the destination device. However, if your app saves or shares captured video internally, for applications outside the system share sheet, you need to use a video-capture format thatʼs compatible with all target devices. This article shows you how to change the capture format dynamically, so that videos captured in your app begin in the desired format.\n\n### Change the default capture format\n\nYou can change the default format at capture time by specifying it in the output settings for capturing movie files. Each capture device has a dictionary of settings that you adjust to control properties of the output movie file. For example, to capture video in H.264\/MPEG-4 AVC, set the output settings key [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVVideoCodecKey] to [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVVideoCodecType\/h264], as the example below shows:\n\nFor a list of supported capture codecs, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVVideoCodecType].\n\n### Convert previously captured movie files\n\nIn addition to saving or sharing captured video using a different default format, you can also convert existing movie file content by generating a new movie file based on the contents of the existing file. For details on how, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/exporting-video-to-alternative-formats].",
