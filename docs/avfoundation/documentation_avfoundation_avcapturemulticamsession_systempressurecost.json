When the value exceeds `1.0`, the capture session cannot run sustainably, but it may be able to run briefly before stopping. While the session is running in an unsustainable configuration, you may monitor the device’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/systemPressureState-swift.property] and reduce pressure by reducing the frame rate, throttling your use of the GPU, and so on.\n\nWhen the session reaches a critical system pressure state, it temporarily shuts down, and your app receives an [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureSession\/wasInterruptedNotification] notification indicating the reason your session stopped.
