The value must be between `0.0` and `1.0`.\n- **time**: A time value within the time range of the composition instruction.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSets a fixed opacity to apply from the specified time until the next time at which an opacity is set; this is the same as setting a flat ramp for that time range. Before the first time for which an opacity is set, the opacity is held constant at `1.0`; after the last specified time, the opacity is held constant at the last value.\n\n## Managing properties\n\n- **setOpacityRamp(fromStartOpacity:toEndOpacity:timeRange:)**: Sets an opacity ramp to apply during a specified time range.\n- **setTransform(_:at:)**: Sets the transform value at a time within the time range of the instruction.\n- **setTransformRamp(fromStart:toEnd:timeRange:)**: Sets a transform ramp to apply during a given time range.\n\n",
