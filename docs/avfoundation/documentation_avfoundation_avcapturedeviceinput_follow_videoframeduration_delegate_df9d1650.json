If it does not, the request times out, the external sync device’s status returns to `AVExternalSyncDeviceStatusReady`, and your session stops running, posting a [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureSession\/runtimeErrorNotification] with `AVErrorFollowExternalSyncDeviceTimedOut`.\n\nThe ability to follow an external sync device may change depending on the device configuration.
