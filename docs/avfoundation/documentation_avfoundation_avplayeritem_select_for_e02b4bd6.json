An AVPlayer’s default media selection criteria can also indicate preferences for media characteristics, such as those indicating the availability of accessibility affordances such as audio descriptions, and these media characteristics can be left up to the AVPlayer to manage even when an AVCustomMediaSelectionScheme is in use. But if you wish to do so, you can use AVMediaPresentationSettings offered by a AVCustomMediaSelectionScheme in combination with custom AVPlayerMediaSelectionCriteria. If the specified setting isn’t offered by an AVMediaPresentationSelector of the AVCustomMediaSelectionScheme of the specified AVMediaSelectionGroup, no change in the presentation of the media will result. This method has no effect when the associated AVPlayer’s appliesMediaSelectionCriteriaAutomatically property has a value of NO, in which case you must use -selectMediaOption:inMediaSelectionGroup: instead in order to alter the presentation state of the media.",
