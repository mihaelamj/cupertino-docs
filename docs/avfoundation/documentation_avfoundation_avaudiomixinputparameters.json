For example, setting the volume to 1.0 at time 0 and also setting a volume ramp from a volume of 0.5 to 0.2 with a timeRange of [4.0, 5.0] results in an audio volume parameters that hold the volume constant at 1.0 from 0.0 sec to 4.0 sec, then cause it to jump to 0.5 and descend to 0.2 from 4.0 sec to 9.0 sec, holding constant at 0.2 thereafter.\n\nGiven that this is an immutable variant of the object, you should not allocate and initialize a version of this class yourself.
