However, the overall exposure, white balance, and focus position should be consistent.\n\n\n\n## Cameras\n\n- **builtInWideAngleCamera**: A built-in wide-angle camera device type.\n- **builtInUltraWideCamera**: A built-in camera device type with a shorter focal length than a wide-angle camera.\n- **builtInTelephotoCamera**: A built-in camera device type with a longer focal length than a wide-angle camera.\n- **builtInDualCamera**: A built-in camera device type that consists of a wide-angle and telephoto camera.\n- **builtInTripleCamera**: A built-in camera device type that consists of three cameras of fixed focal length, one ultrawide angle, one wide angle, and one telephoto.\n- **continuityCamera**: A Continuity Camera device type.\n- **builtInDuoCamera**: A built-in dual camera device type.\n\n",
