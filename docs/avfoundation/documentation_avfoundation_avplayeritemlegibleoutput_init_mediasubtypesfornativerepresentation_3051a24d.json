FourCC codes are converted to `NSNumber` objects as shown:\n\nInitializing an `AVPlayerItemLegibleOutput` using the `init` method (which is preferred) is equivalent to calling this method with an empty `subtypes` array, which means that all legible data, regardless of media subtype, is delivered using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSAttributedString] instances in a common format.\n\nIf a media subtype for which there is no legible data in the current player item is included in the media `subtypes` array, no error occurs.  An `AVPlayerItemLegibleOutput` instance doesn’t vend closed caption data as a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMSampleBuffer], so it is an error to include `'c608'` in the media subtypes array.",
