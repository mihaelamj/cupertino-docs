The wider the field of view of a lens, the greater the areal distortion along the edges of images. Content-aware distortion correction intelligently adjusts its behavior to correct distortions based on the photo’s content. For example, the algorithm may not apply correction to faces in the center of a photo, but may apply it to faces near the photo’s edges.\n\nSwitching cameras or formats, or enabling depth data delivery, may result in a change to this property value.
