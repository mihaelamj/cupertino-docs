To prevent photo capture requests from executing slowly due to lazy resource allocation, you may call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoOutput\/setPreparedPhotoSettingsArray(_:completionHandler:)] method with an array of settings objects representative of the types of capture you will be performing (such as settings for a bracketed capture, RAW capture, or capture with still image stabilization).\n\nBy default, the photo output prepares sufficient resources to capture photos with default settings (as defined by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoSettings] default initializer).",
