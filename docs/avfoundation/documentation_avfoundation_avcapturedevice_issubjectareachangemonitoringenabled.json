You can observe this notification and take action such as focusing, adjusting exposure, and so on.\n\nBefore changing the value of this property, you must call [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/lockForConfiguration()] to acquire exclusive access to the device’s configuration properties. Otherwise, setting the value of this property raises an exception. When you’re finished configuring the device, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureDevice\/unlockForConfiguration()] to release the lock and allow other devices to configure the settings.\n\nThis property is key-value observable.",
