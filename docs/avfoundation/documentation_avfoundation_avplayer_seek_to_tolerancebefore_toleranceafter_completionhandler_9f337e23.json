You can request sample accurate seeking by passing a time value of`kCMTimeZero` for both `toleranceBefore` and `toleranceAfter`. Sample accurate seeking may incur additional decoding delay which can impact seeking performance.\n\nInvoking this method with `toleranceBefore` set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMTime\/positiveInfinity] and `toleranceAfter` set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreMedia\/CMTime\/positiveInfinity] is the same as invoking [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer\/seek(to:)-87h2r].\n\nThe completion handler for any prior seek request that is still in process will be invoked immediately with the `finished` parameter set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false]. If the new request completes without being interrupted by another seek request or by any other operation the specified completion handler will be invoked with the `finished` parameter set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true].",
