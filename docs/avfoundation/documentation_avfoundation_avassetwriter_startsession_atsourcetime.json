In the case of the QuickTime movie file format, the first session begins at movie time `0`, so a sample you append with timestamp `T` plays at movie time (`T-startTime`). The writer adds samples with timestamps earlier than the start time to the output file, but they don’t display during playback. If the earliest sample for an input has a timestamp later than the start time, the system inserts an empty edit to preserve synchronization between tracks of the output asset.\n\nTo end a session, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVAssetWriter\/endSession(atSourceTime:)]or [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVAssetWriter\/finishWriting(completionHandler:)]",
