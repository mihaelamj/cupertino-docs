When you request a thumbnail, the photo output chooses dimensions that best match your requested size while preserving the aspect ratio of the captured photo. Aspect ratio is determined by capture format and by device orientation at the moment of capture.\n\nThis property provides the dimensions of the requested thumbnail image, which is delivered in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfoundation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCapturePhotoCaptureDelegate\/photoOutput(_:didFinishProcessingPhoto:error:)] method. Use this property in earlier delegate methods to find the size of the image before delivery.\n\nIf you do not request a thumbnail image, this property’s value has zero width and zero height.",
