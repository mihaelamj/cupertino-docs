If processing takes longer than the targeted time for the current frame, it attempts to decrease the overall time by reducing the accuracy (down to a set minimum) for the next frame. If a frame takes less time than the targeted time, the request increases the accuracy (up to a set maximum) of the next frame.\n\nThe default value is indefinite, which indicates that accuracy stays at the predefined maximum.",
