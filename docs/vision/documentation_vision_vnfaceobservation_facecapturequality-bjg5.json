Use this value to compare the capture quality of a face against other captures of the same face in a specified set.\n\nThe value of this property value ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Faces with quality closer to `1.0` are better lit, sharper, and more centrally positioned than faces with quality closer to `0.0`.",
