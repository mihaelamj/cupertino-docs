This function invokes these callbacks.\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nYou can use `CFShow` in one of two general ways. If your debugger supports function calls (such as `gdb` does), call `CFShow` in the debugger:\n\nYou can also incorporate calls to `CFShow` in a test version of your code to print out “snapshots” of Core Foundation objects to the console.",
