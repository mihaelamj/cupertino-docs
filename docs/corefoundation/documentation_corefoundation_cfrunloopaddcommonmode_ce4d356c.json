Common modes are a set of run loop modes for which you can define a set of sources, timers, and observers that are shared by these modes. Instead of registering a source, for example, to each specific run loop mode, you can register it once to the run loop’s common pseudo-mode and it will be automatically registered in each run loop mode in the common mode set. Likewise, when a mode is added to the set of common modes, any sources, timers, or observers already registered to the common pseudo-mode are added to the newly added common mode.\n\nOnce a mode is added to the set of common modes, it cannot be removed.\n\nThe Add, Contains, and Remove functions for sources, timers, and observers operate on a run loop’s set of common modes when you use the constant [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFRunLoopMode\/commonModes] for the run loop mode.",
