The specified range must not exceed the length of the string.\n- **parBeginIndex**: On return, the index of the first character of the containing paragraph. Pass `NULL` if you do not want this result.\n- **parEndIndex**: On return, the index of the first character of the paragraph after the specified range. Pass `NULL` if you do not want this result.\n- **contentsEndIndex**: On return, the index of the last character of the containing paragraph, excluding any paragraph-separator characters.
