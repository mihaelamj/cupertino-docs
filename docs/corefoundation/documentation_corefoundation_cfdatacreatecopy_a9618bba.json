If the specified allocator and the allocator of the original object are the same, and the string is already immutable, this function may simply increment the retain count without making a true copy. To the caller, however, the resulting object is a true immutable copy, except the operation was more efficient.\n\nUse this function when you need to pass a CFData object into another function by value (not reference).",
