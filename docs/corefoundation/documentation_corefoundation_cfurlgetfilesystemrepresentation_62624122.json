On return, the buffer holds the native file system’s representation of `url`. The buffer is null-terminated. This parameter must be at least `maxBufLen` in size for the file system in question to avoid failures for insufficiently large buffers.\n- **maxBufLen**: The maximum number of characters that can be written to `buffer`.\n\n## Return Value\n\n`true` if successful, `false` if an error occurred.\n\n## Discussion\n\nNo more than `maxBufLen` bytes are written to `buffer`. If `url` requires more than `maxBufLen` bytes to represent itself, including the terminating null byte, this function returns `false`. To avoid this possible failure, you should pass a buffer with size of at least the maximum path length for the file system in question.\n\n## Converting URLs to Other Representations\n\n- **CFURLCreateData(_:_:_:_:)**: Creates a `CFData` object containing the content of a given URL.\n- **CFURLCreateStringByAddingPercentEscapes(_:_:_:_:_:)**: Creates a copy of a string, replacing certain characters with the equivalent percent escape sequence based on the specified encoding.\n- **CFURLCreateStringByReplacingPercentEscapes(_:_:_:)**: Creates a new string by replacing any percent escape sequences with their character equivalent.\n- **CFURLCreateStringByReplacingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding(_:_:_:_:)**: Creates a new string by replacing any percent escape sequences with their character equivalent.\n- **CFURLGetFSRef(_:_:)**: Converts a given URL to a file or directory object.\n- **CFURLGetString(_:)**: Returns the URL as a `CFString` object.\n\n",
