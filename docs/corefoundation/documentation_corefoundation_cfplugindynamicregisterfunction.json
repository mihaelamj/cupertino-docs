When using in C++, this parameter functions as a `this` pointer for the plug-in.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis callback is called as a plug-in is being loaded. This provides the plugin the means to dynamically register its types and factories with a plug-in’s host. The call is triggered by the presence of [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/kCFPlugInDynamicRegistrationKey] in the plug-in’s information property list.\n\n## Callbacks\n\n- **CFPlugInFactoryFunction**: Callback function that a plug-in author must implement to create a plug-in instance.\n- **CFPlugInUnloadFunction**: Callback function that is called, if present, just before a plug-in’s code is unloaded.\n\n",
