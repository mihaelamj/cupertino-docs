The children of the tree are sorted from least to greatest according to this function.\n- **context**: A pointer-sized program-defined value that is passed to the comparator function, but is otherwise unused by this function.\n\n## Discussion\n\nNote that the comparator only operates one level deep and does not operate on descendants further removed than the immediate children of a tree node.\n\n",
