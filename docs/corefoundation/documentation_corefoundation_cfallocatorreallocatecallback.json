Return NULL on any reallocation failure, leaving the old block of memory untouched. Also return NULL immediately if any of the following conditions if the ptr parameter is NULL or the `newsize` parameter is not greater than 0. Leave the contents of the old block of memory unchanged up to the lesser of the new or old sizes. If the `ptr` parameter is not a block of memory that has been previously allocated by the allocator, the results are undefined; abnormal program termination can occur. The `hint` argument is a bitfield that you should currently not use (that is, assign 0).",
