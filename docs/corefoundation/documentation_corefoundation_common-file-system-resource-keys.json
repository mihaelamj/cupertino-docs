(read-only)\n- **kCFURLIsRegularFileKey**: Key for determining whether the resource is a regular file, as opposed to a directory or a symbolic link. Returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsDirectoryKey**: Key for determining whether the resource is a directory, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsSymbolicLinkKey**: Key for determining whether the resource is a symbolic link, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsVolumeKey**: Key for determining whether the resource is the root directory of a volume, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsPackageKey**: Key for determining whether the resource is a packaged directory, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsSystemImmutableKey**: Key for determining whether the resource’s system immutable bit is set, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsUserImmutableKey**: Key for determining whether the resource’s user immutable bit is set, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsHiddenKey**: Key for determining whether the resource is normally not displayed to users, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLHasHiddenExtensionKey**: Key for determining whether the resource’s extension is normally removed from its localized name, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLCreationDateKey**: Key for the resource’s creation date, returned as a `CFDate` object if the volume supports creation dates, or `nil` if creation dates are unsupported.\n- **kCFURLContentAccessDateKey**: Key for the last time the resource was accessed, returned as a `CFDate` object if the volume supports access dates, or `nil` if access dates are unsupported.\n- **kCFURLContentModificationDateKey**: Key for the last time the resource was modified, returned as a `CFDate` object if the volume supports modification dates, or `nil` if modification dates are unsupported.\n- **kCFURLAttributeModificationDateKey**: Key for the last time the resource’s attributes were modified, returned as a `CFDate` object if the volume supports attribute modification dates, or `nil` if attribute modification dates are unsupported.\n- **kCFURLLinkCountKey**: Key for the number of hard links to the resource, returned as a `CFNumber` object.\n- **kCFURLParentDirectoryURLKey**: Key for the parent directory of the resource, returned as a `CFURL` object, or `nil` if the resource is the root directory of its volume.\n- **kCFURLVolumeURLKey**: Key for the root directory of the resource’s volume, returned as a `CFURL` object.\n- **kCFURLTypeIdentifierKey**: Key for the resource’s uniform type identifier (UTI), returned as a `CFString` object.\n- **kCFURLLocalizedTypeDescriptionKey**: Key for the resource’s

resource’s label color, returned as a `CFColorRef` object, or `NULL` if the resource has no label color.\n- **kCFURLLocalizedLabelKey**: Key for the resource’s localized label text, returned as a `CFString` object, or `NULL` if the resource has no localized label text.\n- **kCFURLEffectiveIconKey**: Key for the resource’s typical icon, returned as a `CGImageRef` object.\n- **kCFURLCustomIconKey**: Key for the icon stored with the resource, returned as a `CGImageRef` object, or `NULL` if the resource has no custom icon.\n- **kCFURLFileResourceIdentifierKey**: Key for the resource’s unique identifier, returned as a `CFType` object.\n- **kCFURLVolumeIdentifierKey**: Key for the unique identifier of the resource’s volume, returned as a `CFType` object.\n- **kCFURLPreferredIOBlockSizeKey**: Key for the optimal block size to use when reading or writing this file’s data, returned as a `CFNumber` object, or `NULL` if the preferred size is not available.\n- **kCFURLIsReadableKey**: Key for determining whether the current process (as determined by the EUID) can read the resource, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsWritableKey**: Key for determining whether the current process (as determined by the EUID) can write to the resource, returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLIsExecutableKey**: Key for determining whether the current process (as determined by the EUID) can execute the resource (if it is a file) or search the resource (if it is a directory), returned as a `CFBoolean` object.\n- **kCFURLFileSecurityKey**: Key for the resource’s security information, returned as a `CFFileSecurity` object.\n- **kCFURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey**\n- **kCFURLFileResourceTypeKey**: Key for the resource’s object type, returned as a `CFString` object.\n\n## File System Constants\n\n- **File Resource Types**: Possible values for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/kCFURLFileResourceTypeKey] key.\n- **File Property Keys**: Keys that apply to properties of files.\n- **iCloud Constants**: These constants can be used to determining whether a file is stored in the cloud and to obtain information about its status.\n- **Volume Property Keys**: Keys that apply to volumes.\n- **CFError userInfo Dictionary Keys**: Keys in the userInfo dictionary of a `CFError` object when certain CFURL functions return an error.\n\n",
