The data is not automatically read; the callback must read the data itself.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nstatic var readCallBack: CFSocketCallBackType { get }\n```\n\n## Constants\n\n- **acceptCallBack**: New connections will be automatically accepted and the callback is called with the data argument being a pointer to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFSocketNativeHandle] of the child socket. This callback is usable only with listening sockets.\n- **dataCallBack**: Incoming data will be read in chunks in the background and the callback is called with the data argument being a CFData object containing the read data.\n- **connectCallBack**\n- **writeCallBack**: The callback is called when the socket is writable. This callback type may be useful when large amounts of data are being sent rapidly over the socket and you want a notification when there is space in the kernel buffers for more data.\n\n",
