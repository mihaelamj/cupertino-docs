Pass `NULL` or kCFAllocatorDefault to use the current default allocator.\n- **bytes**: A pointer to the byte buffer to be used as the backing store of the CFData object.\n- **length**: The number of bytes in the buffer `bytes`.\n- **bytesDeallocator**: The allocator to use to deallocate the external buffer when the CFData object is deallocated. If the default allocator is suitable for this purpose, pass `NULL` or kCFAllocatorDefault. If you do not want the created CFData object to deallocate the buffer (that is, you assume responsibility for freeing it yourself), pass kCFAllocatorNull.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new CFData object, or `NULL` if there was a problem creating the object.
