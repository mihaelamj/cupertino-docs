This key will be used to look up the localized string in the strings file. Typically the key is identical to the value of the localized string in the development language.\n- **value**: A default value to return if no value exists for `key`.\n- **tableName**: The name of the strings file to search. The name should not include the `strings` filename extension. The case of the string must match that of the file name, even on file systems (such as HFS+) that are not case sensitive with regards to file names\n\n## Return Value\n\nA CFString object that contains the localized string. If no value exists for `key`, returns `value` unless `value` is `NULL` or an empty string, in which case `key` is returned instead.
