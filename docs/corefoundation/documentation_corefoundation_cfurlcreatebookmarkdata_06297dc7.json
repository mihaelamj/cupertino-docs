Pass `NULL` or [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/kCFAllocatorDefault] to use the current default allocator.\n- **url**: The URL that bookmark data is being created for.\n- **options**: Options taken into account when creating the bookmark data.\n\nTo create a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, include (by way of bitwise `OR` operators with any other options in this parameter) the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFURLBookmarkCreationOptions\/withSecurityScope] option.\n\nWhen you later resolve the bookmark, you can use the resulting security-scoped URL to obtain read\/write access to the file-system resource pointed to by the URL.\n\nIf you instead want to create a security-scoped bookmark that, when resolved, enables you to obtain read-only access to a file-system resource, bitwise `OR` this parameter’s value with both the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFURLBookmarkCreationOptions\/withSecurityScope] option and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFURLBookmarkCreationOptions\/securityScopeAllowOnlyReadAccess] option.\n- **resourcePropertiesToInclude**: An array of names of URL resource properties. The values of these properties must be of a type that the bookmark generation code can serialize. Specifically, the values can contain any of the following primitive types:\n\n- `NSString` or `CFString`\n- `NSData` or `CFData`\n- `NSDate` or `CFDate`\n- `NSNumber` or `CFNumber`\n- `CFBoolean`\n- `NSURL` or `CFURL`\n- `CFNull`\n- `CFUUID`\n\nIn addition, the properties can contain the following collection classes:\n\n- `NSArray` or `CFArray` containing only the above primitive types\n- `NSDictionary` or `CFDictionary` with `NSString` or `CFString` keys, in which all values contain only the above primitive types\n- **relativeToURL**: The URL that the bookmark data is relative to.\n\nIf you are creating a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, use this parameter as follows:\n\n- To create an app-scoped bookmark, use a value of `nil`.\n- To create a document-scoped bookmark, use the *absolute* path (despite this parameter’s name) to the document file that is to own the new security-scoped bookmark.\n- **error**: The error that occurred in the case that the bookmark data cannot be created.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe bookmark data for the URL.\n\n## Discussion\n\nTo use this function to create a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, you must first have enabled the appropriate entitlements for your app, as described in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Miscellaneous\/Reference\/EntitlementKeyReference\/Chapters\/EnablingAppSandbox.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40011195-CH4-SW18].
