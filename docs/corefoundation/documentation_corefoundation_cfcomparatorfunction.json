You provide a pointer to this callback in certain Core Foundation sorting functions.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\ntypealias CFComparatorFunction = (UnsafeRawPointer?, UnsafeRawPointer?, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> CFComparisonResult\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **val1**: The first value to compare.\n- **val2**: The second value to compare.\n- **context**: An untyped pointer to the context of the evaluation.\n\nThe meaning of this value and its use are defined by each comparator function. This value is usually passed to a sort function, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFArraySortValues(_:_:_:_:)], which then passes it, unchanged, to the comparator function.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA `CFComparisonResult` value that indicates whether the `val1` is equal to, less than, or greater than `val2`.
