The events are listed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFStreamEventType]. If you pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFStreamEventType\/kCFStreamEventNone], the current client for `stream` is removed.\n- **clientCB**: The client callback function to call when one of the events requested in `streamEvents` occurs. If `NULL`, the current client for `stream` is removed.\n- **clientContext**: A structure holding contextual information for the stream client. The function copies the information out of the structure, so the memory pointed to by `clientContext` does not need to persist beyond the function call. If `NULL`, the current client for `stream` is removed.\n\n## Return Value\n\n`true` if the stream supports asynchronous notification, `false` otherwise.\n\n## Discussion\n\nTo avoid polling and blocking, you can register a client to hear about interesting events that occur on a stream.
