The data is not automatically read; the callback must read the data itself.\n- **acceptCallBack**: New connections will be automatically accepted and the callback is called with the data argument being a pointer to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFSocketNativeHandle] of the child socket. This callback is usable only with listening sockets.\n- **dataCallBack**: Incoming data will be read in chunks in the background and the callback is called with the data argument being a CFData object containing the read data.\n- **connectCallBack**\n- **writeCallBack**: The callback is called when the socket is writable. This callback type may be useful when large amounts of data are being sent rapidly over the socket and you want a notification when there is space in the kernel buffers for more data.\n\n## Initializers\n\n- **init(rawValue:)**\n\n## Constants\n\n- **CFSocket Flags**: Flags that can be set on a CFSocket object to control its behavior.\n- **CFSocketError**: Error codes for many CFSocket functions.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- BitwiseCopyable\n- Equatable\n- ExpressibleByArrayLiteral\n- OptionSet\n- RawRepresentable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n- SetAlgebra\n\n",
