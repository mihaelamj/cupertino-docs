Pass `NULL` or kCFAllocatorDefault to use the current default allocator.\n- **capacity**: The maximum number of values that can be contained by the new bag. The bag starts empty and can grow to this number of values (and it can have less). If this parameter is `0`, the bag’s maximum capacity is not limited. This value must not be negative.\n- **callBacks**: A pointer to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFBagCallBacks] structure initialized with the callbacks to use to retain, release, describe, and compare values in the bag. A copy of the contents of the callbacks structure is made, so that a pointer to a structure on the stack can be passed in or can be reused for multiple collection creations. This parameter may be `NULL`, which is treated as if a valid structure of version `0` with all fields `NULL` had been passed in.\n\nIf any of the fields are not valid pointers to functions of the correct type, or this parameter is not a valid pointer to a `CFBagCallBacks` structure, the behavior is undefined. If any value put into the collection is not one understood by one of the callback functions, the behavior when that callback function is used is undefined.\n\nIf the collection contains only CFType objects, then pass kCFTypeBagCallBacks as this parameter to use the default callback functions.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new mutable bag, or `NULL` if there was a problem creating the object.
