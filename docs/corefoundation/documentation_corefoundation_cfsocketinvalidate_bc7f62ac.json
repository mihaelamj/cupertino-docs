Invalidating a CFSocket object prevents the object from sending or receiving any more messages, but does not release the socket object itself.\n\nIf a run loop source was created for `s`, the run loop source is invalidated.\n\nIf a release callback was specified in [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFSocketContext] object, this function calls it to release the object in the  `info` field (which was provided when `s` was created).\n\nBy default, this call closes the underlying socket. If you have explicitly cleared the `kCFSocketCloseOnInvalidate` flag by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFSocketSetSocketFlags(_:_:)], you must close the socket yourself *after* calling this function.",
