The data is not automatically read; the callback must read the data itself.\n- **acceptCallBack**: New connections will be automatically accepted and the callback is called with the data argument being a pointer to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFSocketNativeHandle] of the child socket. This callback is usable only with listening sockets.\n- **connectCallBack**\n- **writeCallBack**: The callback is called when the socket is writable. This callback type may be useful when large amounts of data are being sent rapidly over the socket and you want a notification when there is space in the kernel buffers for more data.\n\n",
