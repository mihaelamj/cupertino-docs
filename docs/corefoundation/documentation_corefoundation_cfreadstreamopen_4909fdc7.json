If the stream can open in the background without blocking, this function always returns `true`. To learn when a background open operation completes, you can either schedule the stream into a run loop with [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFReadStreamScheduleWithRunLoop(_:_:_:)] and wait for the stream’s client (set with [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFReadStreamSetClient(_:_:_:_:)]) to be notified or you can poll the stream using [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFReadStreamGetStatus(_:)], waiting for a status of [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFStreamStatus\/open] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFStreamStatus\/error].\n\nYou do not need to wait until a stream has finished opening in the background before calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corefoundation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFReadStreamRead(_:_:_:)] function.
