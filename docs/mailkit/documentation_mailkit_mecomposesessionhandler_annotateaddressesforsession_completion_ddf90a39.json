The status you provide indicates one of the following:\n\n- The address is valid and correct.\n- The address is invalid or may result in failure to deliver, such as the address of an employee who is no longer at your company.\n- The address may not be valid and needs attention, such as an address outside of your company’s domain.\n\nMail displays the status in the address field using a status icon and color. In addition to the validity, you provide a localized string with additional information that Mail displays to the user.\n\nTo provide status, iterate through the addresses available in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mailkit\/documentation\/MailKit\/MEComposeSession\/mailMessage] property of the `session` parameter.
