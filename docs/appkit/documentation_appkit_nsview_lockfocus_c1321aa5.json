(A one-shot window frees its window device when the window is hidden and another is created when it’s returned to the screen.)

This method throws an exception if the view is hidden or if drawing cannot happen for some other reason. To ensure that you can lock focus successfully, make sure the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/canDraw] property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true]; you can also call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/lockFocusIfCanDraw()] instead and use the return value of that method to determine if focus was obtained successfully.",
