This method is therefore invoked many times per event. The default implementation simply forwards this message to the next responder, ultimately returning `nil`.\n\nEither `sendType` or `returnType`—but not both—may be empty. If `sendType` is empty, the service doesn’t require input from the application requesting the service. If `returnType` is empty, the service doesn’t return data.",
