The `red`, `green`, and `blue` components have a nominal range of [0..1], `exposure` is a value >= 0. To produce an HDR color, we process the given color in a linear color space, multiplying component values by `2^exposure`. The produced color will have a `contentHeadroom` equal to the linearized exposure value. Each whole value of exposure produces a color that is twice as bright.\n\n",
