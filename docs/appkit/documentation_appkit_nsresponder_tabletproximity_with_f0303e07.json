Tablet devices generate proximity events when the transducer (pointing device) nears a tablet and when it moves away from a tablet. From an event object of this type you can extract information about the kind of device and its capabilities, as well as the relation of this tablet-proximity event to various tablet-point events; see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSEvent] reference for details.
