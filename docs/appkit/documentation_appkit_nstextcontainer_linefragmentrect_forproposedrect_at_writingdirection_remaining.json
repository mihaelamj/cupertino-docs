The values passed into the method are either [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWritingDirection\/leftToRight] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWritingDirection\/rightToLeft].\n- **remainingRect**: The remainder of the proposed rectangle that was excluded from returned rectangle.
