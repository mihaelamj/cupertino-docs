To simulate Shift-dragging (continuous selection) `anchorPos` should be the `endPos` used in the last method call. To simulate Command-dragging (discontinuous selection), `anchorPos` should be the same as this method call’s `startPos`.\n- **lit**: [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if cells selected by this method should be highlighted.\n\n## Discussion\n\n`startPos`, `endPos`, and `anchorPos` are cell positions, counting from 0 at the upper left cell of the receiver, in row order. For example, the third cell in the top row would be number 2.\n\nTo simulate dragging without a modifier key, deselecting anything that was selected before, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSMatrix\/deselectAllCells()] before calling this method.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **selectedCells**: An array containing all of the matrix’s highlighted cells plus its selected cell.\n- **isSelectionByRect**: A Boolean that indicates whether the user can select a rectangle of cells in the receiver by dragging the cursor.\n\n## Selecting and Deselecting Cells\n\n- **selectCell(atRow:column:)**: Selects the cell at the specified row and column within the receiver.\n- **selectCell(withTag:)**: Selects the last cell with the given tag.\n- **selectAll(_:)**: Selects and highlights all cells in the receiver.\n- **keyCell**: The cell that will be clicked when the user presses the Space bar.\n- **deselectAllCells()**: Deselects all cells in the receiver and, if necessary, redisplays the receiver.\n- **deselectSelectedCell()**: Deselects the selected cell or cells.\n\n",
