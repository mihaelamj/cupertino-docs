The radius of the starting circle is 0, resulting in the starting circle being just a point.\n\nThe center point of the end circle starts at the center point of `path` and is modified by the value in the `relativeCenterPosition` parameter. For example, if `relativeCenterPosition` contains the point (1.0, 1.0), the center of the end circle is located in the top-right corner of the path’s bounding rectangle. The radius of the end circle is set to the smallest value that ensures `rect` is covered by the end circle.\n\nThe gradient formed by this method is clipped to `path`.",

Each coordinate must contain a value between -1.0 and 1.0. A coordinate value of 0 represents the center of the path’s bounding rectangle along the given axis. In the default coordinate system, a value of -1.0 corresponds to the bottom or left edge of the bounding rectangle and a value of 1.0 corresponds to the top or right edge.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe center point of the starting circle is the same as the center point of `path`. The radius of the starting circle is 0, resulting in the starting circle being just a point.\n\nThe center point of the end circle starts at the center point of `path` and is modified by the value in the `relativeCenterPosition` parameter.
