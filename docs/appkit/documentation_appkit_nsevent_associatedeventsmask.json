  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis property pertains to mouse events. It’s used to determine whether the input device issuing the event can simultaneously issue events of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSEvent\/EventType\/pressure]. This can be useful if you need to determine whether to initiate or begin initiating a pressure-related action when a mouse event occurs.\n\nFor example, suppose you are writing a painting app that uses pressure to determine the size of brush stroke to apply. You can use `associatedEventsMask` to determine whether a mouse-click event is occurring simultaneously with a pressure event. If not, the user may not have pressure-sensitive hardware and you can apply a default size to the brush stroke.\n\nListing 1. Example usage of the associatedEventMask property",
