Set this property to a subview situated visibly below the text in your custom text view. It’s also satisfactory to place this view visually in front of the text. Make sure the size of the view is big enough to cover all of the affected text. If you don’t assign a value to this property, the coordinator places its own decoration view behind the subviews in your custom view. The default value of this property is `nil`.\n\nIf you display your view’s text using multiple text containers, implement the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator\/Delegate\/writingToolsCoordinator(_:singleContainerSubrangesOf:in:)` and `NSWritingToolsCoordinator\/Delegate\/writingToolsCoordinator(_:decorationContainerViewFor:in:)` methods to provide separate decoration views for each container.",
