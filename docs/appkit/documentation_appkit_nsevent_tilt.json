A negative x-coordinate value indicates a tilt to the left and a positive value indicates a tilt to the right; a negative y-coordinate value indicates a tilt to the top and a positive value indicates a tilt to the bottom. If the device is perfectly perpendicular to the table surface, the values are 0.0 for both axes. This property is valid for mouse events with subtype `NSTabletPointEventSubtype` and for `NSTabletPoint` events.",
