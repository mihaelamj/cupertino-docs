Some sample image-related UTI strings include “`public.image`”, “`public.jpeg`”, and “`public.tiff`”. For a list of supported types, see `UTCoreTypes.h`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe returned list includes UTI strings only for those file types that are supported directly by registered subclasses of [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImageRep]. It does not include types that are supported through user-installed filter services. You can use the returned UTI strings with any method that supports UTIs.\n\nDo not override this method directly. If your app supports custom image types, create and register an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImageRep] subclass that handles those types.",
