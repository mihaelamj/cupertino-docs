For example, a text object draws the title of a window, the commands in a menu, the title of a button, and the items in a browser. Your app can also create text objects for its own purposes.\n\n## Creating a Text Object\n\n- **init(coder:)**\n- **init(frame:)**\n\n## Getting the characters\n\n- **string**: The characters of the

editing and possibly to change the first responder.\n- **isRichText**: A Boolean that controls whether the receiver allows the user to apply attributes to specific ranges of the text.\n- **importsGraphics**: A Boolean that controls whether the receiver allows the user to import files by dragging.\n\n## Using the Font panel and menu\n\n- **usesFontPanel**: A Boolean that controls whether the receiver uses the Font panel and Font menu.\n\n## Using the ruler\n\n- **toggleRuler(_:)**: This action method shows or hides the ruler, if the receiver is enclosed in a scroll view.\n- **isRulerVisible**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver’s enclosing scroll view shows its ruler.\n\n## Changing the selection\n\n- **selectedRange**: The receiver’s characters within `aRange`.\n\n## Replacing text\n\n- **replaceCharacters(in:withRTF:)**: Replaces the characters in the given range with RTF text interpreted from the given RTF data.\n- **replaceCharacters(in:withRTFD:)**: Replaces the characters in the given range with RTFD text interpreted from the given RTFD data.\n- **replaceCharacters(in:with:)**: Replaces the characters in the given range with those in the given string.\n\n## Action methods for editing\n\n- **selectAll(_:)**: This action method selects all of the receiver’s text.\n- **copy(_:)**: This action method copies the selected text onto the general pasteboard, in as many formats as the receiver supports.\n- **cut(_:)**: This action method deletes the selected text and places it onto the general pasteboard, in as many formats as the receiver supports.\n- **paste(_:)**: This action method pastes text from the general pasteboard at the insertion point or over the selection.\n- **copyFont(_:)**: This action method copies the font information for the first character of the selection (or for the insertion point) onto the font pasteboard, as `NSFontPboardType`.\n- **pasteFont(_:)**: This action method pastes font information from the font pasteboard onto the selected text or insertion point of a rich text object, or over all text of a plain text object.\n- **copyRuler(_:)**: This action method copies the paragraph style information for first selected paragraph onto the ruler pasteboard, as `NSRulerPboardType`, and expands the selection to paragraph boundaries.\n- **pasteRuler(_:)**: This action method pastes paragraph style information from the ruler pasteboard onto the selected paragraphs of a rich text object.\n- **delete(_:)**: This action method deletes the selected text.\n\n## Changing the font\n\n- **changeFont(_:)**: This action method changes the font of the selection for a rich text object, or of all text for a plain text object.\n- **font**: The font of all the receiver’s text.\n- **setFont(_:range:)**: Sets the font of characters within `aRange` to `aFont`.\n\n## Setting text alignment\n\n- **alignment**: The alignment of all the receiver’s text.\n- **alignCenter(_:)**: This action method applies center alignment to selected paragraphs (or all text if the receiver is a plain text object).\n- **alignLeft(_:)**: This action method applies left alignment to selected paragraphs (or all text if the receiver is a plain text object).\n- **alignRight(_:)**: This action method applies right alignment to selected paragraphs (or all text if the receiver is a plain text object).\n\n## Setting text color\n\n- **textColor**: The text color of all characters in the receiver.\n- **setTextColor(_:range:)**: Sets the text color of characters within the specified range to the specified color.\n\n## Writing direction\n\n- **baseWritingDirection**: The initial writing direction used to determine the actual writing direction for text.\n\n## Setting superscripting and subscripting\n\n- **superscript(_:)**: This action method applies a superscript attribute to selected text (or all text if the receiver is a plain text object), raising its baseline offset by a predefined amount.\n- **subscript(_:)**: This action method applies a subscript attribute to selected text (or all text if the receiver is a plain text object), lowering its baseline offset by a predefined amount.\n- **unscript(_:)**: This action method removes any superscripting or subscripting from selected text (or all text if the receiver is a plain text object).\n\n## Underlining text\n\n- **underline(_:)**: Adds the underline attribute to the selected text attributes if absent; removes the attribute if present.\n\n## Reading and writing RTF files\n\n- **readRTFD(fromFile:)**: Attempts to read the RTFD file at the specified path.\n- **writeRTFD(toFile:atomically:)**: Writes the receiver’s text as RTF with attachments to a file or directory at `path`.\n- **rtfd(from:)**: Returns an NSData object that contains an RTFD stream corresponding to the characters and attributes within `aRange`.\n- **rtf(from:)**: Returns an NSData object that

action method searches for a misspelled word in the receiver’s text.\n- **showGuessPanel(_:)**: This action method opens the Spelling panel, allowing the user to make a correction during spell checking.\n\n## Constraining size\n\n- **maxSize**: The receiver’s maximum size.\n- **minSize**: The receiver’s minimum size.\n- **isVerticallyResizable**: A Boolean that controls whether the receiver changes its height to fit the height of its text.\n- **isHorizontallyResizable**: A Boolean that controls whether the receiver changes its width to fit the width of its text.\n- **sizeToFit()**:
