If the receiver’s content is fetched automatically, removed objects are marked for deletion by the managed object context (and hence removal from the object graph). If, however, the receiver’s `contentSet` is bound to a relationship, `removeObject:` by default only removes the object from the relationship (not from the object graph). You can, though, set the “Deletes Object on Remove” option for the `contentSet` binding, in which case objects are marked for deletion as well as being removed from the relationship.",
