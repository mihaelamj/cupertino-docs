Valid values are `NSWindowAbove` or `NSWindowBelow`.\n- **otherView**: The other view `aView` is to be positioned relative to. If `otherView` is `nil` (or isn’t a subview of the view), `aView` is added above or below all of its new siblings.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method also sets the view as the next responder of `aView`.\n\nThe view retains `aView`.
