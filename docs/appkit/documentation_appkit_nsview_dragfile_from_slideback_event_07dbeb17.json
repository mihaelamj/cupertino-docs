The icon slides back to `aRect` if `slideBack` is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], the file is not accepted by the dragging destination, and the user has not disabled icon animation; otherwise it simply disappears.\n- **event**: The mouse-down event object from which to initiate the drag operation. In particular, its mouse location is used for the offset of the icon being dragged.\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if the view successfully initiates the dragging operation (which doesn’t necessarily mean the dragging operation concluded successfully).
