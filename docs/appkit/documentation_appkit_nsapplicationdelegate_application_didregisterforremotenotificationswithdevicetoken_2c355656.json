The token is an opaque data type because that is the form that the provider needs to submit to the APNS servers when it sends a notification to a device. The APNS servers require a binary format for performance reasons.\n\nThe size of a device token is 32 bytes.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe delegate receives this message after the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/registerForRemoteNotifications(matching:)]method of [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication] is invoked and there is no error in the registration process.
