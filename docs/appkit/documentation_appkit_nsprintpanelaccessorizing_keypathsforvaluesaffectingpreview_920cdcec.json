Only key paths for properties that might affect the contents of the print preview should be returned.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf an accessory view modifies printing-related properties that are used by the print preview, you should implement this method to return the key paths for those properties. For example, if you write an accessory view that lets the user change the left and right document margins in the current `NSPrintInfo` object, you would return the following key paths: `representedObject.leftMargin`, `representedObject.rightMargin`. (The `NSPrintInfo` object is the represented object of the accessory controller.)\n\nImplementation of this method is optional. You do not need to implement this method if you are not using the `NSPrintPanel` object’s built-in preview facilities. If you do use these facilities, however, you should implement this method.",
