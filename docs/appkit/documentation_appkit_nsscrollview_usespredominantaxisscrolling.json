With scroll balls and touch surfaces, it becomes more difficult to determine the user’s intention.\n\nThis property helps a scroll view determine the user’s intention by specifying if there is a predominant scrolling axis for content.\n\nWhen the value of this property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], the scroll view uses a predominant scrolling access.
