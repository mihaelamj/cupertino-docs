For other types of buttons, this property value defaults to `1`. For multilevel accelerator buttons, this property value defaults to `2`, and may be set to a value between `1` and `5`.\n\nLike a normal accelerator button, the button sends an action when the user first clicks it. If configured as continuous (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSControl\/isContinuous]), while pressed, it then sends actions at repeating intervals that are based on pressure. If not configured as continuous, actions are sent as the user force clicks (presses harder) and reaches different levels of pressure. Once released, a final action is sent.\n\nThe value of a multilevel accelerator button is distinct from its state. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSControl\/integerValue] of a multilevel button is `0` when not clicked, or `1` through `5` when clicked, depending on the level of pressure. If the value of a multilevel accelerator button is explicitly set, actions are not sent until pressure reaches the specified level.\n\nOn a system that doesn’t support pressure sensitivity, a multilevel accelerator button always has a value of `1` when the user clicks it.",

If the button has borders, it may also appear recessed. When the button is released, it returns to its normal (off) state.\n- **NSPushOnPushOffButton**: When the button is clicked (on state), it appears illuminated. If the button has borders, it may also appear recessed. A second click returns it to its normal (off) state.\n- **NSToggleButton**: After the first click, the button displays its alternate image or title (on state); a second click returns the button to its normal (off) state.\n- **NSSwitchButton**: This style is a variant of `NSToggleButton` that has no border and is typically used to represent a checkbox.\n- **NSRadioButton**: This style is similar to `NSSwitchButton`, but it is used to constrain a selection to a single element from several elements.\n- **NSMomentaryChangeButton**: When the button is clicked, the alternate (on state) image and alternate title are displayed.\n- **NSOnOffButton**: The first click highlights the button; a second click returns it to the normal (unhighlighted) state.\n- **NSAcceleratorButton**: A button that sends an action when the user first clicks the button and continues sending actions until the user releases pressure entirely.\n- **NSMomentaryPushInButton**: When the user clicks the button (on state), the button appears illuminated.\n- **NSMomentaryPushButton**: When the button is clicked (on state), it appears illuminated. If the button has a bordered, it may also appear recessed. When the button is released, it returns to its normal (off) state.\n- **NSMomentaryLight**: When the button is clicked (on state), it appears illuminated.\n\n",
