The next time any image representation is drawn, it is asked to recreate its cached image. If you do not send this message, the image representation may use the old cache data. This method simply clears the cached image data; it does not delete the `NSCachedImageRep` objects associated with any image representations.\n\nIf you do not plan to use an image again right away, you can free its caches to reduce the amount of memory consumed by your program.",
