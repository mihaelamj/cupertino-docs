Colors created with an exposure by NSColor create CGColors that are tagged with a contentHeadroom value. While CGColors created without a contentHeadroom tag will return 0 from CGColorGetHeadroom, NSColors generated in a similar fashion return a linearExposure of 1.0.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nvar linearExposure: CGFloat { get }\n```\n\n## Supporting high dynamic range (HDR) colors\n\n- **standardDynamicRange**: In some cases it is useful to recover the color that was base the SDR color that was exposed to generate an HDR color. If a color’s `linearExposure` is > 1, then this will return the base SDR color. If the color is not an HDR color, this will return `self`.\n- **applyingContentHeadroom(_:)**: Reinterpret the color by applying a new `contentHeadroom` without changing the color components. Changing the `contentHeadroom` redefines the color relative to a different peak white, changing its behavior under tone mapping and the result of calling `standardDynamicRangeColor`. The new color will have a `contentHeadroom` >= 1.0. If called on a color with a color space that does not support extended range, or does not have an equivalent extended range counterpart, this will return `self`.\n\n",
