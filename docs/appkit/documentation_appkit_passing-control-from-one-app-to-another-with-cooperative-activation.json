Not only is it inconvenient for people to switch back to their original app, if they’re typing when the switch occurs, they might accidentally enter text into the wrong app, inadvertently disclosing sensitive information.\n\nCooperative activation addresses this problem by making app activation a request instead of a command. Instead of apps stealing focus, they now request focus from the system when they’re ready. This means apps should set expectations accordingly when requesting activation and not assume the system will grant them activation. The system dynamically determines whether to grant activation state based on the context. This lets you request focus for your app when needed, and hand off focus from one app to another.\n\n### Request activation to gain focus\n\nWhen your app needs focus, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/activate()] on your app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/shared] instance, or its shorthand version `NSApp`:\n\nCalling this function sends a message to the system requesting activation for the app. Requesting activation doesn’t guarantee your app gains focus.

It does so by yielding to an explicit target app before the target app activates. Then, when the target app requests activation, the system uses the yield as part of the context when making its decision. If the system honors the request, the active app deactivates, and the target app activates. Otherwise, the active app remains active. [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWorkspace] automatically handles this for you when opening URLs or applications.\n\nFor example, to pass control from your active app to another target app (such as TextEdit, which is a good test candidate because it comes installed on every Mac):\n\nAlternatively, if the app you want to pass control to isn’t currently running, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/yieldActivation(toApplicationWithBundleIdentifier:)] on the `NSApp` instance, passing in the bundle identifier of the target app you want to activate.\n\nThen call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/activate()] on the target app when it’s ready to gain focus.\n\nChoosing between [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSRunningApplication] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication] for activation depends on which app you want to initiate the activation.
