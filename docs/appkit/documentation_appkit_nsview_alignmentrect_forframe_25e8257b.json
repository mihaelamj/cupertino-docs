This allows custom views to be aligned based on the location of their content while still having a frame that encompasses any ornamentation they need to draw around their content, such as shadows or reflections.\n\nThe default implementation returns the view’s frame modified by the insets specified by the view’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/alignmentRectInsets] method. Most custom views can override [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/alignmentRectInsets] to specify the location of their content within their frame. Custom views that require arbitrary transformations can override [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/alignmentRect(forFrame:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/frame(forAlignmentRect:)] to describe the location of their content.
