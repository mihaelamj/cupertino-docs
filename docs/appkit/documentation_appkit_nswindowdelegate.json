methods that a window’s delegate can implement to respond to events, such as window resizing, moving, exposing, and minimizing.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nprotocol NSWindowDelegate : NSObjectProtocol\n```\n\n## Managing Sheets\n\n- **window(_:willPositionSheet:using:)**: Tells the delegate that the window is about to show a sheet at the specified location, giving it the opportunity to return a custom location for the attachment of the sheet to the window.\n- **windowWillBeginSheet(_:)**: Notifies the delegate that the window is about to open a sheet.\n- **windowDidEndSheet(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has closed a sheet.\n\n## Sizing Windows\n\n- **windowWillResize(_:to:)**: Tells the delegate that the window is being resized (whether by the user or through one of the `setFrame...` methods other than [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow\/setFrame(_:display:)]).\n- **windowDidResize(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has been resized.\n- **windowWillStartLiveResize(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window is about to be live resized.\n- **windowDidEndLiveResize(_:)**: Tells the delegate that a live resize operation on the window has ended.\n\n## Minimizing Windows\n\n- **windowWillMiniaturize(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window is about to be minimized.\n- **windowDidMiniaturize(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has been minimized.\n- **windowDidDeminiaturize(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has been deminimized.\n\n## Zooming Window\n\n- **windowWillUseStandardFrame(_:defaultFrame:)**: Called by `NSWindow`’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow\/zoom(_:)] method while determining the frame a window may be zoomed to.\n- **windowShouldZoom(_:toFrame:)**: Asks the delegate whether the specified window should zoom to the specified frame.\n\n## Managing Full-Screen Presentation\n\n- **window(_:willUseFullScreenContentSize:)**: Called to allow the delegate to modify the full-screen content size.\n- **window(_:willUseFullScreenPresentationOptions:)**: Returns the presentation options the window uses when transitioning to full-screen mode.\n- **windowWillEnterFullScreen(_:)**: The window is about to enter full-screen mode.\n- **windowDidEnterFullScreen(_:)**: The window has entered full-screen mode.\n- **windowWillExitFullScreen(_:)**: The window is about to exit full-screen mode.\n- **windowDidExitFullScreen(_:)**: The window has left full-screen mode.\n\n## Custom Full-Screen Presentation Animations\n\n- **customWindowsToEnterFullScreen(for:)**: Called when the window is about to enter full-screen mode.\n- **customWindowsToEnterFullScreen(for:on:)**: Called when the window is about to enter full-screen mode.\n- **window(_:startCustomAnimationToEnterFullScreenWithDuration:)**: This method is called to start the window animation into full-screen mode, including transitioning to a new space.\n- **window(_:startCustomAnimationToEnterFullScreenOn:withDuration:)**: This method is called to start the window animation into full-screen mode, including transitioning to a new space.\n- **windowDidFailToEnterFullScreen(_:)**: Called if the window failed to enter full-screen mode.\n- **customWindowsToExitFullScreen(for:)**: Called when the window is about to exit full-screen mode.\n- **window(_:startCustomAnimationToExitFullScreenWithDuration:)**: This method is called to start the window animation out of full-screen mode, including transitioning back to the desktop space.\n- **windowDidFailToExitFullScreen(_:)**: Called if the window failed to exit full-screen mode.\n\n## Moving Windows\n\n- **windowWillMove(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window is about to move.\n- **windowDidMove(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has moved.\n- **windowDidChangeScreen(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has changed screens.\n- **windowDidChangeScreenProfile(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has changed screen display profiles.\n- **windowDidChangeBackingProperties(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window backing properties changed.\n\n## Closing Windows\n\n- **windowShouldClose(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the user has attempted to close a window or the window has received a [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow\/performClose(_:)] message.\n- **windowWillClose(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window is about to close.\n\n## Managing Key Status\n\n- **windowDidBecomeKey(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has become the key window.\n- **windowDidResignKey(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has resigned key window status.\n\n## Managing Main Status\n\n- **windowDidBecomeMain(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has become main.\n- **windowDidResignMain(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has resigned main window status.\n\n## Managing Field Editors\n\n- **windowWillReturnFieldEditor(_:to:)**: Tells the delegate that the field editor for a text-displaying object has been requested.\n\n## Updating Windows\n\n- **windowDidUpdate(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window received an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow\/update()] message.\n\n## Exposing Windows\n\n- **windowDidExpose(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has been exposed.\n\n## Managing Occlusion State\n\n- **windowDidChangeOcclusionState(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window changed its occlusion state.\n\n## Dragging Windows\n\n- **window(_:shouldDragDocumentWith:from:with:)**: Asks the delegate whether a user can drag the document icon from the window’s title bar.\n\n## Getting the Undo Manager\n\n- **windowWillReturnUndoManager(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window’s undo manager has been requested. Returns the appropriate undo manager for the window.\n\n## Managing Titles\n\n- **window(_:shouldPopUpDocumentPathMenu:)**: Asks the delegate whether the window displays the title pop-up menu in response to a Command-click or Control-click on its title.\n\n## Managing Restorable State\n\n- **window(_:willEncodeRestorableState:)**: Tells the delegate the window is about to add its restorable state to a given archiver.\n- **window(_:didDecodeRestorableState:)**: Tells the delegate the window is has extracted its restorable state from a given archiver.\n\n## Managing Presentation in Version Browsers\n\n- **window(_:willResizeForVersionBrowserWithMaxPreferredSize:maxAllowedSize:)**: Tells the delegate the window will resize for presentation during version browsing.\n- **windowWillEnterVersionBrowser(_:)**: Tells the delegate the window is about to enter version browsing.\n- **windowDidEnterVersionBrowser(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has entered version browsing.\n- **windowWillExitVersionBrowser(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window is about to leave version browsing.\n- **windowDidExitVersionBrowser(_:)**: Tells the delegate that the window has left version browsing.\n\n## Instance Methods\n\n- **previewRepresentableActivityItems(for:)**\n- **windowForSharingRequest(from:)**: Method called to get the window to share once sharing is confirmed, after a request is initiated by requestSharingOfWindowUsingPreview:title:completionHandler:. Implement this on the delegate of the requesting window\n\n## Windows\n\n- **NSWindow**: A window that an app displays on the screen.\n- **NSPanel**: A special kind of window that typically performs a function that is auxiliary to the main window.\n- **NSWindowTab**: A tab associated with a window that is part of a tabbing group.\n- **NSWindowTabGroup**: A group of windows that display together as a single tabbed window.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObjectProtocol\n\n",
