You should watch for this notification instead of `NSWindowDidChangeScreenProfileNotification` if your app runs on a system version on which the backing properties notification is available.\n\nMany apps won’t have the need to watch for this notification, but those that perform sophisticated color handling or manually manage their own cache of window-resolution or color-space-appropriate bitmapped images will find this notification useful as a prompt to invalidate caches or schedule other reassessment for the new resolution or color space. The notification’s `userInfo` dictionary specifies the window’s previous backing scale factor (retrieved with the key`NSBackingPropertyOldScaleFactorKey`) and color space (retrieved with the key `NSBackingPropertyOldColorSpaceKey`). You can compare these with the window’s new previous backing scale factor and color space at the time of the notification to determine which properties changed.",
