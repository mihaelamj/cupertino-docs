However, you may want to retrieve and directly inspect the rectangle list if this is a more efficient way to perform intersection testing.\n\nYou should send this message only from within a [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/draw(_:)] implementation. The `aRect` parameter of [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/draw(_:)] is the rectangle enclosing the returned list of rectangles; you can use it in an initial pass to reject objects that are clearly outside the area to be drawn.",
