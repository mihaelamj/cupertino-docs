These visual effects let people know the state of the text and provide feedback about what’s happening to it. Set this property to a subview that sits visually above, and covers, all of the text in your custom text view. If you don’t assign a value to this property, the coordinator places its own effect view in front of the subviews in your custom view. The default value of this property is `nil`.\n\nIf you display your view’s text using multiple text containers, implement the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator\/Delegate\/writingToolsCoordinator(_:singleContainerSubrangesOf:in:)` method to request multiple previews.",
