During a Writing Tools session, you hide the text under evaluation and provide a targeted preview of your content. Writing Tools animations changes to that preview, but you might need to provide additional animations for other parts of your view’s content. For example, you might need to animate any layout changes caused by the insertion or removal of text in other parts of your view. Use this object to configure those animations.\n\nYou don’t create an `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.AnimationParameters` object directly. Instead, the system creates one and passes it to the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator\/writingToolsCoordinator(_:replaceRange:inContext:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` method of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWritingToolsCoordinator\/Delegate-swift.protocol] object.
