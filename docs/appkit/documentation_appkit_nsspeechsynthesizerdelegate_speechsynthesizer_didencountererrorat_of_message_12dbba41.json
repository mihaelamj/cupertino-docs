This can be useful during application debugging, to detect problems with commands that you have embedded in strings that your application speaks. It can also be useful if your application allows users to embed commands within strings. Your application might display an alert indicating that the synthesizer encountered a problem in processing an embedded command.\n\nIf your application needs information about errors that occurred prior to calling your error delegate method, the application (including the error delegate method) can call the sender’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSSpeechSynthesizer\/object(forProperty:)] method with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSSpeechSynthesizer\/SpeechPropertyKey\/errors] constant.",
