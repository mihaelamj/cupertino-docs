The differences in the UI between the current state and new state are animated. If [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], the collection view UI is set to the new state without any animations, with no additional overhead for computing a diff. Any ongoing item animations are interrupted and the collection view’s content is reloaded immediately.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIt’s safe to call this method from a background queue, but you must do so consistently in your app. Always call this method exclusively from the main queue or from a background queue.\n\n## Updating Data\n\n- **snapshot()**: Returns a representation of the current state of the data in the collection view.\n\n",
