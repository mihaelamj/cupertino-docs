In other words, both views slide to the right.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nstatic var slideRight: NSViewController.TransitionOptions { get }\n```\n\n## Constants\n\n- **crossfade**: A transition animation that fades the new view in and simultaneously fades the old view out. You can combine this animation option with any of the “slide” options in this enumeration.\n- **slideUp**: A transition animation that slides the old view up while the new view comes into view from the bottom.  In other words, both views slide up.\n- **slideDown**: A transition animation that slides the old view down while the new view slides into view from the top. In other words, both views slide down.\n- **slideLeft**: A transition animation that slides the old view to the left while the new view slides into view from the right. In other words, both views slide to the left.\n- **slideForward**: A transition animation that reflects the user interface layout direction ([doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/userInterfaceLayoutDirection]) in a “forward” manner, as follows:\n- **slideBackward**: A transition animation that reflects the user interface layout direction ([doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/userInterfaceLayoutDirection]) in a “backward” manner, as follows\n- **allowUserInteraction**: A transition animation that allows user interaction during the transition.\n\n",
