For the main storyboard, this is usually the first controller presented to the user at launch time. Designate the initial view controller in Interface Builder when configuring the storyboard file.\n\nTypically, you call this method only when transitioning to the initial view controller in a different storyboard file. For your app’s main storyboard file—that is, the storyboard file specified in the app’s `Info.plist` file using the `UIMainStoryboardFile` key—the initial view controller is loaded into memory and presented automatically.\n\nEach time you call this method, it creates a new instance of the initial controller.",
