The Application Kit predefines several special marker objects used as values for indicating selection state; currently these are [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSMultipleValuesMarker], [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSNoSelectionMarker], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSNotApplicableMarker]. These markers are typed as `id` and only exist for the purpose of indicating a state; they are never archived and cannot be used as object values in controls. You use this function to test whether a given object value is a marker, in which case it is not directly assignable to the object that is bound. This check is important, especially since additional markers may be added in the future.\n\nSee the `NSKeyValueBinding.h` header file for further details.",
