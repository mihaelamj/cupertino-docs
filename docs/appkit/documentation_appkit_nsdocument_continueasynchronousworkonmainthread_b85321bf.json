Invocations of this method always return before the passed-in block is invoked.\n\nYou can invoke this method when work is being done on a non-main thread and part of the work must be continued on the main thread. For example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDocument\/save(to:ofType:for:completionHandler:)] uses this method when it has just completed the actual writing of the file during asynchronous saving and, to finish the saving operation, must invoke [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDocument\/updateChangeCount(withToken:for:)] and other methods on the main thread.\n\nThis method can be invoked on any thread.",
