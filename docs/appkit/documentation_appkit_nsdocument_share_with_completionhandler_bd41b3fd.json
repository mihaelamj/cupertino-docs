As needed, the method moves the file to an appropriate location for sharing. For example, when saving to iCloud, the method moves the file to the user’s iCloud Drive folder. After the sharing service finishes, the method calls `completionHandler` with the results.\n\nThe document temporarily replaces the current delegate of `sharingService` with itself. However, the document retains a reference to the old delegate object and forwards all delegate method calls to it.\n\nIf an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDocument] object is the only item associated with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSSharingServicePicker] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSSharingServicePickerTouchBarItem], the picker automatically calls this method directly, instead of sharing the items using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSSharingService\/perform(withItems:)] method.\n\nIf you override this method, you must ensure that the document is in the proper state before attempting to share it.
