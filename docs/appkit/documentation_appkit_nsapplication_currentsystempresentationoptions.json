The constants are listed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/PresentationOptions-swift.struct] and can combined using a C bitwise OR operator.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis property contains the presentation options that have been put into effect by the currently active app. You can use key-value observing on this property to receive notifications when:\n\n- The client is the active app and makes a change itself using either the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplication\/presentationOptions-swift.property] property or the `SetSystemUIMode` function.\n- Another app is active and makes presentation changes of its own.\n- Another app becomes active and causes the active set of presentation options to change.\n\nKey-value observing notifications aren’t sent when one of the above conditions occur, but has the same set of presentation options as the previously active app.\n\n## Managing the app’s appearance\n\n- **appearance**: The appearance associated with the app’s windows.\n- **effectiveAppearance**: The appearance that AppKit uses to draw the app’s interface.\n- **presentationOptions**: The presentation options that should be in effect for the system when this app is active.\n- **NSApplication.PresentationOptions**: Constants that control the presentation of the app, typically for fullscreen apps such as games or kiosks.\n- **applicationShouldSuppressHighDynamicRangeContent**: A boolean value indicating whether your application should suppress HDR content based on established policy. Built-in AppKit components such as NSImageView will automatically behave correctly with HDR content. You should use this value in conjunction with notifications (`NSApplicationShouldBeginSuppressingHighDynamicRangeContentNotification` and `NSApplicationShouldEndSuppressingHighDynamicRangeContentNotification`) to suppress HDR content in your application when signaled to do so.\n\n",
