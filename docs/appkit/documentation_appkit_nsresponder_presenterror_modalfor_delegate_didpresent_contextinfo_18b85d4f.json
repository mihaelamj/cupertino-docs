Once the user dismisses the alert and any recovery attempter associated with the error object has had a chance to recover from it, the receiver sends a message identified by `didPresentSelector` to the modal delegate `delegate`. (A recovery attempter is an object that conforms to the NSErrorRecoveryAttempting informal protocol.)\n\nThe modal delegate implements the method identified by `didPresentSelector` to perform any post-error processing if recovery failed or was not attempted (that is, `didRecover` is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false]). Any supplemental data is passed to the modal delegate via `contextInfo`.\n\nThe default implementation of this method sends [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSResponder\/willPresentError(_:)] to `self`. By doing this, `NSResponder` gives subclasses an opportunity to customize error presentation. It then forwards the message, passing any customized error to the next responder or, if there is no next responder, it passes the error object to `NSApp`, which displays a document-modal error alert. When the user dismisses the alert, any recovery attempter associated with the error object is given a chance to recover from the error. See the class description for the precise route up the responder chain (plus document and controller objects) this message might travel.\n\nIt is not recommended that you attempt to override this method.  If you wish to customize the error presentation, override [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSResponder\/willPresentError(_:)] instead.",
