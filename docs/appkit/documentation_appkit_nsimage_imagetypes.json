Some sample image-related UTI strings include “`public.image`”, “`public.jpeg`”, and “`public.tiff`”. For a list of supported types, see `UTCoreTypes.h`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe returned list includes UTIs all file types supported by registered subclasses of `NSImageRep` plus those that can be converted to a supported type by a user-installed filter service. You can use the returned UTI strings with any method that supports UTIs.\n\nDo not override this method directly. If your app supports custom image types, create and register an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImageRep] subclass that handles those types.",
