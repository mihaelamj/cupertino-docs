See the discussion for the implications of the type of context.\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if successful; otherwise, returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false].\n\n## Methods\n\n- **lockFocus()**: Locks the focus on the view, so subsequent commands take effect in the view’s window and coordinate system.\n- **lockFocusIfCanDraw()**: Locks the focus to the view atomically if the `canDraw` method returns `true` and returns the value of `canDraw`.\n- **unlockFocus()**: Unlocks focus from the current view.\n- **scroll(_:by:)**: Copies the visible portion of the view’s rendered image within a region and lays that portion down again at a specified offset .\n- **shouldDrawColor()**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the view is being drawn to an environment that supports color.\n- **allocateGState()**: Causes the view to maintain a private graphics state object, which encapsulates all parameters of the graphics environment.\n- **gState()**: Returns the identifier for the view’s graphics state object, or 0 if the view doesn’t have a graphics state object.\n- **setUpGState()**: Overridden by subclasses to (re)initialize the view’s graphics state object.\n- **renewGState()**: Invalidates the view’s graphics state object, if it has one.\n- **releaseGState()**: Frees the view’s graphics state object, if it has one.\n- **dragFile(_:from:slideBack:event:)**: Initiates a dragging operation from the view, allowing the user to drag a file icon to any application that has window or view objects that accept files.\n- **dragPromisedFiles(ofTypes:from:source:slideBack:event:)**: Initiates a dragging operation from the view, allowing the user to drag one or more promised files (or directories) into any application that has window or view objects that accept promised file data.\n\n",
