If the control contains multiple cells, the one that initiated the message is usually the selected cell.\n- **textView**: The field editor of the control. You can use this parameter to get the typed text.\n- **words**: An array of `NSString` objects containing the potential completions. The completion strings are listed in their order of preference in the array.\n- **charRange**: The range of characters the user has already typed.\n- **index**: On input, an integer variable with the default value of `0`. On output, you can set this value to an index in the returned array indicating which item should be selected initially. Set the value to `-1` to indicate there should not be an initial selection.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn array of `NSString` objects containing the list of completions to use in place of the array in the `words` parameter.
