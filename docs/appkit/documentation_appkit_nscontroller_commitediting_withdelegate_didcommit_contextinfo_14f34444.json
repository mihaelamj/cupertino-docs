It should implement the method specified by `didCommitSelector`.\n- **didCommitSelector**: A selector that is invoked on delegate. The method specified by the selector must have the same signature as the following method:\n\n```objc\n- (void)editor:(id)editor didCommit:(BOOL)didCommit contextInfo:(void  *)contextInfo\n```\n- **contextInfo**: Contextual information that is sent as the `contextInfo` argument to delegate when `didCommitSelector` is invoked.\n\n## Discussion\n\nProvides support for the NSEditor informal protocol.
