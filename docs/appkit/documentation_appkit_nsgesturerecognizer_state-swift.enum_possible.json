This is the default state.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\ncase possible\n```\n\n## Constants\n\n- **NSGestureRecognizer.State.began**: The gesture recognizer has recognized a sequence of events as a continuous gesture. It calls its action method at the next cycle of the run loop.\n- **NSGestureRecognizer.State.changed**: The gesture recognizer has detected a change to a continuous gesture. It calls its action method at the next cycle of the run loop.\n- **NSGestureRecognizer.State.ended**: The gesture recognizer has detected the end of a continuous gesture. It calls its action method at the next cycle of the run loop and resets its state to [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/possible].\n- **NSGestureRecognizer.State.cancelled**: The gesture recognizer received events that resulted in the cancellation of a continuous gesture. It calls its action method at the next cycle of the run loop and resets its state to [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/possible].\n- **NSGestureRecognizer.State.failed**: The gesture recognizer failed to recognize its gesture and will not call its action method. The gesture recognizer resets itself to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/possible] state.\n- **recognized**: The gesture recognizer successfully recognized its gesture. It calls its action method at the next cycle of the run loop and resets its state to [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/possible].\n\n",
