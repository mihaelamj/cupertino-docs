This method returns the object in the `pasteboard` parameter if the pasteboard was returned by one of the `pasteboardByFiltering...` methods. This prevents a pasteboard from being expanded multiple times.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis process can be thought of as expanding the pasteboard, because the new pasteboard generally contains more representations of the data than `pasteboard`.\n\nThis method only returns the original types and the types that can be created as a result of a single filter; the pasteboard does not have defined types that are the result of translation by multiple filters.\n\nNo filter service is invoked until the data is actually requested, so invoking this method is reasonably inexpensive.",
