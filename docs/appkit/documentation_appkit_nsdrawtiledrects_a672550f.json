  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nThe rectangle that lies within the resulting border.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis is a generic function that can be used to draw different types of borders inside a given rectangle. These borders can be used to outline an area or to give rectangles the effect of being recessed from or elevated above the surface of the screen.\n\nThe `sides`, `grays`, and `count` parameters determine how thick the border is and what gray levels are used to form it. This function uses the `NSDivideRect` function to take successive 1.0-unit-wide slices from the sides of the rectangle specified by the `sides` parameter. Each slice is drawn using the corresponding gray level from the `grays` parameter. This function makes and draws these slices `count` number of times. If you specify the same side more than once, the second slice is drawn inside the first.\n\nThe following example uses this function to draw a bezeled border consisting of a 1.0–unit-wide white line at the top and on the left side and a 1.0-unit-wide dark-gray line inside a 1.0–unit-wide black line on the other two sides. The resulting rectangle inside this border is then filled in using light gray.\n\nIn the preceding example, `mySides` is an array that specifies sides of a rectangle; for example, `NSMinYEdge` selects the side parallel to the x axis with the smallest y coordinate value. `myGrays` is an array that specifies the successive gray levels to be used in drawing parts of the border.",

Since this function is often used to draw the border of a view, this rectangle will typically be that view’s bounds rectangle. Only those parts of `boundsRect` that lie within the `clipRect` are actually drawn.\n- **clipRect**: The clipping rectangle to use during drawing.\n- **sides**: The sides of the rectangle for which you want to specify custom gray levels. Each side must have a corresponding entry in the `grays` parameter.\n- **grays**: The gray levels to draw for each of the edges listed in the `sides` parameter.\n- **count**: The number of 1.0-unit-wide slices to draw on the specified sides.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe rectangle that lies within the resulting border.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis is a generic function that can be used to draw different types of borders inside a given rectangle.
