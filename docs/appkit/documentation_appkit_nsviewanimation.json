(See [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSViewAnimation\/Key] for further information.) Animations with [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSViewAnimation] are, by default, in non-blocking mode over a duration of 0.5 seconds using the ease in-out animation curve. But you can configure the animation to have any duration, curve, frame rate, and blocking mode. You may also set progress marks, assign a delegate, and implement delegation methods in order to animate view and windows concurrent with the ones specified as targets in the view-animation dictionary.\n\nInvoking the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSAnimation] [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSAnimation\/stop()] method on a running [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSViewAnimation] object moves the animation to the end frame.",
