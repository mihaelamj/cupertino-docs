If you do this, always use the domain and error code of the `NSError` object to distinguish between errors whose presentation you want to customize and those you do not. Don’t make decisions based on the localized description, recovery suggestion, or recovery options because parsing localized text is problematic. If you decide not to customize the error presentation, just return the passed-in error object.",
