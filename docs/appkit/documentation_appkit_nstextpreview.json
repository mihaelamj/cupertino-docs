  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn `NSTextPreview` object provides a static image of your view’s text content that the system can use to create animations. You provide preview objects in response to system requests, such as ones from Writing Tools. In addition to creating an image of your view’s text, you also specify the location of that text in your view’s frame rectangle. When creating animations, the system places the image on top of your view’s content and animates changes to the image instead of to your view.\n\nCreate an `NSTextPreview` object in response to specific system requests. Create an image with a transparent background and render your view’s text into the image using the current text attributes. Construct your `NSTextPreview` object with both the image and the frame rectangle that represents the location of the rendered text in your view’s coordinate system. To highlight specific portions of text, instead of all the text in the image, provide a set of candidate rectangles with the locations of the text you want to highlight.",
