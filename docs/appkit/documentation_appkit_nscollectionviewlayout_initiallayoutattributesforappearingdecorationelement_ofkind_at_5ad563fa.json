  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nThe layout attributes object that describes the decoration view’s position and properties at the start of animations.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen your layout object adds decoration views in response to other changes in the collection view, the collection view calls this method for each decoration view before animating it onscreen. Because new decoration views are not yet visible in the collection view, the attributes you return represent the view’s starting state. For example, you might return attributes that position the decoration view offscreen or set its initial alpha to `0`. The collection view uses the attributes you return as the starting point for any animations. (The end point of the animation is the view’s new location and attributes.) If you return `nil`, the layout uses the decoration view’s final attributes for both the start point and end point of the animation.\n\nThe default implementation of this method returns `nil`. Subclasses are expected to override this method, as needed, and provide any initial attributes.",
