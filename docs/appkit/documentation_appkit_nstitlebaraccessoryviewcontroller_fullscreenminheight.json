The minimum height you set determines how much of your accessory view is visible when the menu bar is hidden during full screen mode. By default, the minimum height is `0`, which means that the accessory view is hidden when the menu bar is hidden. When a user reveals the menu bar in this scenario, the accessory view is also revealed.\n\nTo persistently show a portion of the accessory view, set this property to a value greater than `0`. For example, if you have a fixed height accessory view, you can set [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTitlebarAccessoryViewController\/fullScreenMinHeight] to `view.frame.size.height` to show the view regardless of whether the menu bar is hidden. Note that the view’s height is never actually changed when it is hidden or revealed; instead, it is automatically clipped by an internal clip view.",
