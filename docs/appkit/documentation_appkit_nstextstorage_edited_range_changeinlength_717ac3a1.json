Subclasses that override or add methods that alter their attributed strings directly should invoke this method after making those changes; otherwise you shouldn’t invoke this method.

You make the value by combining with the C bitwise OR operator the options described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTextStorageEditActions].\n- **editedRange**: The extent of characters affected before the change took place.\n- **delta**: The number of characters added to or removed from `oldRange`. If no characters where edited as noted by `mask`, its value is irrelevant and undefined. For example, when replacing “The” with “Several” in the string “The files couldn’t be saved”, `oldRange` is {0, 3} and `lengthChange` is 4.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method invokes [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTextStorage\/processEditing()] if there are no outstanding [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSMutableAttributedString\/beginEditing()] calls. `NSTextStorage` invokes this method automatically each time it makes a change to its attributed string.
