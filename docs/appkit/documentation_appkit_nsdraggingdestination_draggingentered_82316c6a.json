Specifically, this method is invoked when the mouse pointer enters the destination’s bounds rectangle (if it is a view object) or its frame rectangle (if it is a window object).\n\nThis method must return a value that indicates which dragging operation the destination will perform when the image is released. In deciding which dragging operation to return, the method should evaluate the overlap between both the dragging operations allowed by the source (obtained from `sender` with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDraggingInfo\/draggingSourceOperationMask] method) and the dragging operations and pasteboard data types the destination itself supports.\n\nIf none of the operations is appropriate, this method should return `NSDragOperationNone` (this is the default response if the method is not implemented by the destination).
