Built-in AppKit components such as NSImageView will automatically behave correctly with HDR content. You should use this value in conjunction with notifications (`NSApplicationShouldBeginSuppressingHighDynamicRangeContentNotification` and `NSApplicationShouldEndSuppressingHighDynamicRangeContentNotification`) to suppress HDR content in your application when signaled to do so.\n\n",
