However, the key equivalent isn’t displayed if the image position is set to `NSNoImage`, `NSImageOnly`, or `NSImageOverlaps`; that is, the button must display both its title and its “image” (which is the key equivalent in this case), and they must not overlap.\n\nTo display a key equivalent on a button, set the image and alternate image to `nil`, set the key equivalent, and then set the image position.",
