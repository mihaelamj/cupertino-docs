This allows custom views to be aligned based on the location of their content while still having a frame that encompasses any ornamentation they need to draw around their content, such as shadows or reflections.\n\nThe default implementation returns `alignmentRect` modified by the insets specified by the view’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/alignmentRectInsets] method. Most custom views can override [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/alignmentRectInsets] to specify the location of their content within their frame. Custom views that require arbitrary transformations can override [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/alignmentRect(forFrame:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/frame(forAlignmentRect:)] to describe the location of their content.
