This mask is used by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/resize(withOldSuperviewSize:)] method when the view needs to be resized.\n\nIf the autoresizing mask is set to `NSViewNotSizable` (that is, if none of the options are set), the view does not resize at all. When more than one option along an axis is set, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/resize(withOldSuperviewSize:)] method distributes the size difference as evenly as possible among the flexible portions. For example, if `NSViewWidthSizable` and `NSViewMaxXMargin` are set and the superview’s width has increased by `10.0` points, the view’s frame and right margin are each widened by `5.0` points.",
