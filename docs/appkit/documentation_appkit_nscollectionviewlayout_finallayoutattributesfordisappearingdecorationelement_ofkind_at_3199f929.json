  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nThe layout attributes object that describes the decoration view’s position and properties at the end of animations.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen your layout object removes decoration views in response to other changes in the collection view, the collection view calls this method for each decoration view you remove. Use this method to specify the layout attributes for the view after it has been removed. For example, you might return attributes that position the decoration view offscreen or set its alpha to `0`. The collection view uses the attributes you return as the end point for any animations. (The start point of the animation is the view’s current location and attributes.) If you return `nil`, the layout uses the decoration view’s current attributes for both the start point and end point of the animation.\n\nThe default implementation of this method returns `nil`. Subclasses are expected to override this method, as needed, and provide any initial attributes.",
