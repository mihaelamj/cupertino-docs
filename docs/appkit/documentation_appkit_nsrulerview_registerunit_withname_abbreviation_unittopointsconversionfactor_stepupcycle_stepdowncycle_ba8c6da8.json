The unit name is used as a key to identify the measurement units and so shouldn’t be localized. `abbreviation` is a localized short form of the unit name, such as “in” for Inches. `conversionFactor` is the number of PostScript points in the specified unit; there are 72.0 points per inch, for example. `stepUpCycle` and `stepDownCycle` are arrays of NSNumbers that specify how hash marks are calculated, as explained in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/Rulers\/Tasks\/SettingUpRulerView.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/20000874].
