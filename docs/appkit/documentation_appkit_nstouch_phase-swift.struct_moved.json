Or, an active touch transitioned to a resting touch and resting touches are not wanted by the view hierarchy.\n- **cancelled**: The system cancelled tracking for the touch, as when (for example) the window associated with the touch resigns key or is deactivated.\n- **touching**: Matches the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTouch\/Phase-swift.struct\/began], [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTouch\/Phase-swift.struct\/moved], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTouch\/Phase-swift.struct\/stationary] phases of a touch.\n- **any**: Matches any phase of a touch.\n\n",
