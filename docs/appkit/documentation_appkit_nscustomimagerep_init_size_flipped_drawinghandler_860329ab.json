Care should be taken to ensure that all state accessed within the drawingHandler block is done so in a thread safe manner.\n\nThis Block replaces the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImage\/lockFocus()] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImage\/unlockFocus()] technique of creating drawing content. The block is invoked at draw time, the drawing can be adjusted to suit the destination’s pixel density, color space, and other properties.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn initialized [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSCustomImageRep] object, or `nil` if the object could not be initialized.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUsing the this method ensures you’ll get correct results under standard and high resolution.\n\nLike other non-bitmap image rep types, drawing is cached as appropriate for the destination context.
