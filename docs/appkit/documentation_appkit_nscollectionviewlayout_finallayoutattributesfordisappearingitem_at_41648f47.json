  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nThe layout attributes object that describes the item’s position and properties at the end of animations.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen your app removes items from the collection view, the collection view calls this method for each item you remove. Use this method to specify the layout attributes of the item after it has been removed. For example, you might return attributes that position the item offscreen or set its final alpha to `0`. The collection view uses the attributes you return as the end point for any animations. (The start point of the animation is the item’s current location and attributes.) If you return `nil`, the layout uses the item’s current attributes for both the start point and end point of the animation.\n\nThe default implementation of this method returns `nil`. Subclasses are expected to override this method, as needed, and provide any final attributes.",
