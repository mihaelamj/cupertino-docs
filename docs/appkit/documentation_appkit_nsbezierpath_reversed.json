For example, reversing the path of a rectangle (whose line segments are normally drawn starting at the origin and proceeding in a counterclockwise direction) causes its line segments to be drawn in a clockwise direction instead. Drawing a reversed path could affect the appearance of a filled pattern, depending on the pattern and the fill rule in use.\n\nThe path in this property is created by reversing each whole or partial subpath in the path object individually.",
