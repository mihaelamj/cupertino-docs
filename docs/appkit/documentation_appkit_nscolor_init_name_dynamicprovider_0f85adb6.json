The provider can use the appearance to return another color to use for drawing. For example, if you create a color matching [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor\/systemYellow] for Light appearance, you’ll get a color matching [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor\/systemYellow] for Dark appearance when using Dark Mode. As often as possible, use the given appearance.\n\nThe `colorName` is equal to the identity of the color and should be universally unique; if `nil`, the system generates a unique name.\n\nThe name and the Light (aqua) appearance are encoded as part of this color. If a color is already registered with the same name as the decoded color, the decoded color joins the other color and becomes dynamic again.",
