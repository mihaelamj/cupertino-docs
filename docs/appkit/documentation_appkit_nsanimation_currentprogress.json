Valid values are in the range `0.0` to `1.0`, where `0.0` represents the beginning of the animation and `1.0` represents the end of the animation.\n\nChanging the value of this property adjusts the progress of a running animation. Setting this property to a value less than `0.0` sets the value of the property to `0.0`. Similarly, specifying a value greater than `1.0` changes the value of the property to `1.0`.  The `NSAnimation` class updates the value of this property during the animation.
