Embedding one view inside another creates a containment relationship between the host view (known as the *superview*) and the embedded view (known as the *subview*). View hierarchies make it easier to manage views.\n\nYou can also use views to do any of the following:\n\n- Respond to touches and other events (either directly or in coordination with gesture recognizers).\n- Draw custom content using Core Graphics.\n- Respond to focus changes.\n- Animate the size, position, and appearance attributes of the view using Core Animation.\n\nFavor AppKit views and controls whenever possible. These components adapt automatically to system changes, and many support appearance customizations to support the look and feel you want in your app. When AppKit doesn’t provide the exact view or control you need, you can create a custom view.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView] is the root class for all views and defines their common behavior. [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSControl] defines additional behaviors that are specific to buttons, switches, and other views designed for user interactions.\n\nFor additional information about how to use views and controls, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/components\/all-components].\n\n## View fundamentals\n\n- **NSView**: The infrastructure for drawing, printing, and handling events in an app.\n- **NSControl**: A specialized view, such as a button or text field, that notifies your app of relevant events using the target-action design pattern.\n- **NSCell**: A mechanism for displaying text or images in a view object without the overhead of a full [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView] subclass.\n- **NSActionCell**: An active area inside a control.\n\n## Container views\n\n- **Localization-friendly layouts in macOS**: This project demonstrates localization-friendly auto layout constraints.\n- **Grid View**: Arrange views in a flexible grid, and handle the layout associated with those views.\n- **NSSplitView**: A view that arranges two or more views in a linear stack running horizontally or vertically.\n- **Organize Your User Interface with a Stack View**: Group individual views in your app’s user interface into a scrollable stack view.\n- **NSStackView**: A view that arranges an array of views horizontally or vertically and updates their placement and sizing when the window size changes.\n- **NSTabView**: A multipage interface that displays one page at a time.\n- **Scroll View**: Provide an interface for navigating content that is too large to fit in the available space.\n\n## Content views\n\n- **Browser View**: Provide a column-based interface for viewing and navigating hierarchical information.\n- **Collection View**: Display one or more subviews in a highly configurable arrangement.\n- **Outline View**: Display a list-based interface for hierarchical data, where each level of hierarchy is indented from the previous one.\n- **Table View**: Display custom data in rows and columns.\n- **NSTextView**: A view that draws text and handles user interactions with that text.\n\n## Controls\n\n- **Responding to control-based events using target-action**: Handle user input by connecting buttons, sliders, and other controls to your app’s code using the target-action design pattern.\n- **NSButton**: A control that defines an area on the screen that a user clicks to trigger an action.\n- **NSColorWell**: A control that displays a color value and lets the user change that color value.\n- **Combo Box**: Display a list of values in a pop-up menu that lets the user select a value or type in a custom value.\n- **NSComboButton**: A button with a pull-down menu and a default action.\n- **Date Picker**: Display a calendar date and provide controls for editing the date value.\n- **NSImageView**: A display of image data in a frame.\n- **NSLevelIndicator**: A visual representation of a level or quantity, using discrete values.\n- **Path Control**: A display of a file system path or virtual path information.\n- **NSPopUpButton**: A control for selecting an item from a list.\n- **NSProgressIndicator**: An interface that provides visual feedback to the user about the status of an ongoing task.\n- **NSRuleEditor**: An interface for configuring a rule-based list of options.\n- **NSPredicateEditor**: A defined set of rules that allows the editing of predicate objects.\n- **Search Field**: Provide a text field that is optimized for text-based search interfaces.\n- **NSSegmentedControl**: Display one or more buttons in a single horizontal group.\n- **Slider**: Display a range of values from which the user selects a single value.\n- **NSStepper**: An interface with up and down arrow buttons for incrementing or decrementing a value.\n- **Text Field**: Provide a simple interface for displaying and editing text, including support for password fields and secure forms of text entry.\n- **Token Field**: Provide a text field whose text can be rendered in a visually distinct way so that users can recognize portions more easily.\n- **Toolbar**: Provide a space for controls under a window’s title bar and above your custom content.\n- **NSSwitch**: A control that offers a binary choice.\n- **NSMatrix**: A legacy interface for grouping radio buttons or other types of cells together.\n\n## Liquid Glass effects\n\n- **NSGlassEffectView**: A view that embeds its content view in a dynamic glass effect.\n- **NSGlassEffectView.Style**\n- **NSGlassEffectContainerView**: A view that efficiently merges descendant glass effect views together when they are within a specified proximity to each other.\n\n## Interacting with adjacent views\n\n- **NSBackgroundExtensionView**: A view that extends content to fill its own bounds.\n\n## Visual adornments\n\n- **NSVisualEffectView**: A view that adds translucency and vibrancy effects to the views in your interface.\n- **NSBox**: A stylized rectangular box with an optional title.\n\n## UI validation\n\n- **NSUserInterfaceValidations**: A protocol that a custom class can adopt to manage the enabled state of a UI element.\n- **NSValidatedUserInterfaceItem**: A protocol that a custom class can adopt to manage the automatic enablement of a UI control.\n\n## Tool tips\n\n- **NSViewToolTipOwner**: A set of methods for dynamically associating a tool tip with a view.\n\n## Related types\n\n- **NSRectAlignment**: Constants that specify alignment to an edge or a set of edges depending on the user interface layout direction.\n- **NSDirectionalEdgeInsets**: The inset distances for views, taking the user interface layout direction into account.\n- **NSDirectionalRectEdge**\n\n## User Interface\n\n- **View Management**: Manage your user interface, including the size and position of views in a window.\n- **View Layout**: Position and size views using a stack view or Auto Layout constraints.\n- **Appearance Customization**: Add Dark Mode support to your app, and use appearance proxies to modify your UI.\n- **Animation**: Animate your views and other content to create a more engaging experience for users.\n- **Windows, Panels, and Screens**: Organize your view hierarchies and facilitate their display onscreen.\n- **Sound, Speech, and Haptics**: Play sounds and haptic feedback, and incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into your interface.\n- **Supporting Continuity Camera in Your Mac App**: Incorporate scanned documents and pictures from a user’s iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch into your Mac app using Continuity Camera.\n\n",
