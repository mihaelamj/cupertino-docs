This initializer makes a copy of the string you provide, so you can discard the original when you’re done.\n- **range**: The portion of `attributedString` you want Writing Tools to evaluate. If you want Writing Tools to evaluate the entire string you provided, specify a range with a location of `0` and a length equal to your string’s length. If you want Writing Tools to evaluate only part of the string, provide the appropriate range in this parameter. Writing Tools suggests changes only to the range of text you specify, but it can consider text outside that range during the evaluation process.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen Writing Tools asks for your view’s current selection, it’s best to create a string that includes text before and after that selection.
