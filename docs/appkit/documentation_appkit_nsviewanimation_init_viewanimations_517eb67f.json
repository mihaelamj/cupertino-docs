Each dictionary specifies a view or window to animate and the effect to apply. `viewAnimations` can be `nil`, but you must later set the required array of dictionaries with [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSViewAnimation\/viewAnimations] if you want to use the capabilities of the `NSViewAnimation` class. See`View Animation Dictionary Keys` for a description of valid keys and values for dictionaries in `viewAnimations`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe created `NSViewAnimation` object or `nil` if there was a problem initializing the object.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Cocoa Drawing Guide**\n\n",
