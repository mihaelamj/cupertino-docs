For example, suppose your app has a tracking loop that you exit when the user releases the mouse button. You could use this method, specifying `NSAnyEventMask` as the mask argument and the ending mouse-up event as the `lastEvent` argument, to discard all events that occurred while you were tracking mouse movements in your loop. Passing the mouse-up event as `lastEvent` ensures that any events that might have occurred after the mouse-up event (that is, that appear in the queue after the mouse-up event) aren’t discarded.\n\nFor the `mask` parameter, you can add together event type constants such as the following:\n\nThis method can also be called in subthreads. Events posted in subthreads bubble up in the main thread event queue.",

The constants section of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSEvent] class defines the constants you can add together to create this mask. The discussion section also lists some of the constants that are typically used.\n- **lastEvent**: A marker event that you use to indicate which events should be discarded. Events that occurred before this event are discarded but those that occurred after it are not.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to ignore any events that occurred before a specific event.
