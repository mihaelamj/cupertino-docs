May not be `nil`.\n- **newView**: The view to replace `oldView`. May not be `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method does nothing if `oldView` is not a subview of the view.\n\nNeither `oldView` nor `newView` may be `nil`, and the behavior is undefined if either of these parameters is `nil`.\n\nThis method causes `oldView` to be released; if you plan to reuse it, be sure to retain it before sending this message and to release it as appropriate when adding it as a subview of another NSView.\n\nCalling this method also removes any constraints associated with `oldView` and its subtree.\n\n## Adding and Removing Subviews\n\n- **addSubview(_:)**: Adds a view to the view’s subviews so it’s displayed above its siblings.\n- **addSubview(_:positioned:relativeTo:)**: Inserts a view among the view’s subviews so it’s displayed immediately above or below another view.\n- **removeFromSuperview()**: Unlinks the view from its superview and its window, removes it from the responder chain, and invalidates its cursor rectangles.\n- **removeFromSuperviewWithoutNeedingDisplay()**: Unlinks the view from its superview and its window and removes it from the responder chain, but does not invalidate its cursor rectangles to cause redrawing.\n- **sortSubviews(_:context:)**: Orders the view’s immediate subviews using the specified comparator function.\n\n",
