The target view calls this method to determine whether the gesture recognizer should process events for the stream, or opt out of them. Returning [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] from this method causes the gesture recognizer to opt out, and prevents the other delegate methods from being called for the event stream.",
