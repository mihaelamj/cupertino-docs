When this facility is enabled in this way, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDocument\/init(contentsOf:ofType:)] executes on a background thread when opening files via the Open panel or from the Finder. This allows concurrent reading of multiple documents and also allows the app to be responsive while reading a large document.\n\nThe default implementation of this method returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false].
