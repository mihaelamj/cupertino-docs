Invoke [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/scroll(_:by:)] to copy the rendered image.\n2. Move the view object’s origin or scroll it within its superview.\n3. Calculate the newly exposed rectangles and either set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/needsDisplay] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] or call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/setNeedsDisplay(_:)] to draw them.\n\nYou should rarely need to use this method, however.
