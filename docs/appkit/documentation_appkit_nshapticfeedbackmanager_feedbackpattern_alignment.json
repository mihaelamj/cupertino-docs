Other scenarios where this type of feedback could be used might include scaling an object to fit within specific dimensions, positioning an object at a preferred location, or reaching the beginning\/minimum or end\/maximum of something, such as a track view in an audio\/video app.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\ncase alignment\n```\n\n## Constants\n\n- **NSHapticFeedbackManager.FeedbackPattern.generic**: A general haptic feedback pattern. Use this when no other feedback patterns apply.\n- **NSHapticFeedbackManager.FeedbackPattern.levelChange**: A haptic feedback pattern to be used as the user moves between discrete levels of pressure. This pattern of feedback is used by multilevel accelerator buttons (class [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSMultiLevelAcceleratorButton]).\n\n",
