Pass `0` to place the window in front of (when `place` is `NSWindowAbove`) or behind (when `place` is `NSWindowBelow`) all other windows in its level.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **windowNumber**: The window number of the window’s window device.\n- **makeKeyAndOrderFront(_:)**: Moves the window to the front of the screen list, within its level, and makes it the key window; that is, it shows the window.\n\n## Managing Window Layers\n\n- **orderOut(_:)**: Removes the window from the screen list, which hides the window.\n- **orderBack(_:)**: Moves the window to the back of its level in the screen list, without changing either the key window or the main window.\n- **orderFront(_:)**: Moves the window to the front of its level in the screen list, without changing either the key window or the main window.\n- **orderFrontRegardless()**: Moves the window to the front of its level, even if its application isn’t active, without changing either the key window or the main window.\n- **level**: The window level of the window.\n- **NSWindow.Level**: The standard window levels in macOS.\n\n",
