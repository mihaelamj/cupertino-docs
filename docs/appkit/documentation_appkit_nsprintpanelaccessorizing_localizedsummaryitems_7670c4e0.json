The values for the keys are both strings. This method must not return `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAccessory panels must implement this method to return information about the panel’s current settings. The returned array should contain a dictionary for each setting that is managed by the accessory panel and each dictionary should contain two key-value pairs identifying the name of the setting and its current value.\n\nYour accessory view must be KVO-compliant for the `localizedSummaryItems` key path because `NSPrintPanel` object observes that key path and uses it to keep the contents of the summary view up to date. This means your view should manually send KVO notifications to observers for the `localizedSummaryItems` key path whenever the contents of the set of summary items changes.
