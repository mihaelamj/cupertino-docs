The framework also contains built-in support for localization and accessibility to ensure that your app reaches as many people as possible.\n\nAppKit also works with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI], so you can implement parts of your AppKit app in SwiftUI or mix interface elements between the two frameworks. For example, you can place AppKit views and view controllers inside SwiftUI views, and vice versa.",
