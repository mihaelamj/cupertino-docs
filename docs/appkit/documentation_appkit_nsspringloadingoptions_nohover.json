The user can drag an object over a destination object and force click to initiate spring-loading and activate the destination object. This option may be useful in situations where a long hover, such as dragging across a large destination object, initiates undesired spring-loading. Use this constant sparingly.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nstatic var noHover: NSSpringLoadingOptions { get }\n```\n\n## Constants\n\n- **disabled**: Spring-loading on the destination object is disabled. No spring-loading operations can occur.\n- **enabled**: Spring-loading on the destination object is enabled. The user can drag an object over a destination object and hover or force click to initiate spring-loading and activate the destination object. When initiated by a force click, spring-loading is invoked once the force click is released.\n- **continuousActivation**: Spring-loading on the destination object is enabled. The user can drag an object over a destination object and hover or force click to initiate spring-loading and activate the destination object. When initiated by a force click, spring-loading is invoked once the force click begins and deactivated when the force click is released. When initiated by hovering, spring-loading is invoked at the hover timeout and deactivated when the drag exits the destination object. Use this constant sparingly.\n\n",
