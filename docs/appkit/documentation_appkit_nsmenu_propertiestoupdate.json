This property is intended to allow for more efficient updating of the menu in certain circumstances.\n\nFor example, if the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSMenu\/Properties\/propertyItemImage] property isn’t set, your delegate doesn’t need to spend time updating the images of the menu items, because the images aren’t needed (for example, during key-equivalent matching).\n\nYou have to update a menu property only if it has changed since you last set it, even if the corresponding bit is `1`. For example, if the title of a menu item never changes, you have to set it only once.\n\nAccessing this property is optional; it is always acceptable to fully update all properties of the menu.",
