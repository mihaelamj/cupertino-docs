Cells and views cannot be mixed within the same outline view.\n\nIt is recommended that the implementation of this method first call the `NSTableView` method [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTableView\/makeView(withIdentifier:owner:)] passing, respectively, the `tableColumn` parameter’s identifier and `self` as the owner to attempt to reuse a view that is no longer visible.
