The location value of this range is relative to the beginning of the text in your context object, and it’s your responsibility to match that location to the correct location in your text storage. If you initialized the context object with the entire contents of your view’s text storage, you can use `range` as-is to access that text storage. However, if you initialized the context object with only a portion of your view’s text, add the starting location of your context object’s text to this value to get the correct range for that text storage.\n- **context**: The context object that contains the text to consider. Use this object to locate the appropriate text storage object for your view.\n- **completion**: A completion handler to execute when you are done. The handler has no return value and takes an array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSValue] types, each of which contains an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSRange-c.struct]. The union of the ranges you pass to this handler must equal all of the text in `range`. The order of the ranges in the array must be sequential, with each new range’s starting location coming after the previous one. There must also not be any gaps or overlap between ranges. You must call this handler at some point during your implementation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf your view uses multiple [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTextContainer] objects to draw text in different regions, use this method to tell Writing Tools about the containers that display the specified text.
