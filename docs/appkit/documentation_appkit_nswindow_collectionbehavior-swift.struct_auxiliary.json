Auxiliary windows prefer being shown alongside primary windows.\n\nTo set a different behavior in full screen, while keeping Stage Manager auxiliary, set a more specific behavior just for full screen mode (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow\/CollectionBehavior-swift.struct\/fullScreenNone]).\n\nUse this collection behavior for About or Settings windows as well as utility panes.",
