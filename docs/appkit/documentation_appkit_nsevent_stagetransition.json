  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis property is specifically intended to provide a value for the transition animation between the stages of a pressure gesture event.\n\nGesture events of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSEvent\/EventType\/pressure] go through stages, and transitions occur between these stages. This property indicates a transition value between the current stage and the next or prior stage.\n\nThis value is distinct from pressure. It immediately resets to `0` as soon as a stage transition occurs. However, this value does not then immediately begin to fluctuate. The value only starts to change as a new stage begins to approach. It then continues to rise or fall throughout the transition, until that new stage is reached.\n\nAs pressure increases for the gesture and a new stage approaches, this property provides a value between `0` and `1`, indicating the approach of the next stage. When pressure is reduced for the gesture and a new stage is approached, this property provides a value between `0` and `-1`, indicating the approach of the current stage’s release.",
