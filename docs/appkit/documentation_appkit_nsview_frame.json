Changing the frame does not mark the view as needing to be displayed.

You can specify a custom bounds rectangle by changing the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/bounds] property or by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/setBoundsOrigin(_:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/setBoundsSize(_:)] method explicitly. Once set, the view creates an internal transform to convert from frame coordinates to bounds coordinates. As long as the width-to-height ratio of the two coordinate systems remains the same, your content appears normal. If the ratios differ, your content may appear skewed.\n\nThe frame rectangle may be rotated relative to its superview’s coordinate system.
