For example, when a window is deallocated, you can use this method to remove notification observers and bindings associated with the view.\n\nWhen a window is deallocated, AppKit calls this method for each view in the window, passing `nil` for the `newWindow` parameter. AppKit does not necessarily call this method when closing a window, though. Closing a window usually just hides the window.
