The next time the layout process happens, the constraint-based layout system uses the value of this property to determine whether it needs to call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/updateConstraints()] on the view. Use this as an optimization tool to batch constraint changes. Updating constraints all at once just before they are needed ensures that you don’t needlessly recalculate constraints when multiple changes are made to your view in between layout passes.",
