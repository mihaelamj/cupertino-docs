Your delegate delivers your view’s text to Writing Tools, incorporates suggested changes back into your text storage, and supports the animations that Writing Tools creates to show the state of an operation.\n\nCreate the `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` object when setting up your UI, and initialize it with a custom object that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWritingToolsCoordinator\/Delegate-swift.protocol] protocol. Add the coordinator to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/writingToolsCoordinator] property of your view. When a coordinator is present on a view, the system adds UI elements to initiate Writing Tools operations.\n\nWhen defining the delegate, choose an object from your app that has access to your view and its text storage. You can adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWritingToolsCoordinator\/Delegate-swift.protocol] protocol in the view itself, or in another type that your view uses to manage content.
