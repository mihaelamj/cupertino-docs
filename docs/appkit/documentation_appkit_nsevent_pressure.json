  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nFor input devices that are pressure-sensitive, the value is increased as pressure is applied to the device.\n\nFor [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSEvent\/EventType\/pressure] events, pressure value relates to the current [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSEvent\/stage] of the gesture event. Each stage has its own pressure curve. For example, pressure ranges from `0.0` through `1.0` for a stage 1 event, and `0.0` through `1.0` for a stage 2 event. Pressure readings should be retrieved for a single stage of a gesture only, and should not be combined to achieve a wider range of pressure levels. In most cases, retrieving pressure during stage 1 is sufficient and appropriate for supporting variable input. Stage 1 pressure is the most physically comfortable for the user. Stage 2 pressure should only be used in rare circumstances where additional tactile feedback is necessary prior to retrieving pressure level.\n\nFor input devices that aren’t pressure-sensitive, the value is either `0.0` or `1.0`. An [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSExceptionName\/internalInconsistencyException] exception is raised if this property is accessed on an event other than a mouse-up, mouse-down, mouse-drag, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTabletPoint], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSEvent\/EventType\/pressure] event.\n\nFor tablet pointing devices that are in proximity, the pressure value is `0.0` if the user is not actually touching the tablet.\n\nPressure is not intended to measure weight.",
