If a view with the specified identifier can’t be instantiated from the nib file or found in the reuse queue, this method returns `nil`.\n\nThis method is usually called by the delegate in [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTableViewDelegate\/tableView(_:viewFor:row:)], but it can also be overridden to provide custom views for the `identifier`.
