  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis sample code project creates a meme generator that combines an image and text into a composite meme image which can be exported as a JPEG. The sample shows you how to support both file URLs and file promises when accepting images from Mail, Safari, Photos, and other apps that support drag and drop. It also demonstrates how to provide file promises to other apps.\n\nYour app may need to support file promises because drag and drop on macOS uses an NSPasteboard, which is separate from the normal copy-and-paste clipboard. When dragging content that isnʼt yet a file on disk at the time dragging began, an app may put a file promise onto the pasteboard instead of a file URL, to avoid blocking the main thread. File promises are different from URLs because they can be read and written asynchronously at a later time, on a background queue separate from the main queue. macOS Sierra introduced modern APIs to handle file promises.\n\n### Configure the Sample Code Project\n\nTo see this sample in action, build and run the project, then drag an image from another app or location, such as Finder, Mail, or Safari, into the app window. Dragging the image into the window imports it into a form the sample app can parse and consume. Add text to the image by clicking on the text button in the upper-right corner and typing. Reposition the text box by dragging and dropping it within the app window. Dragging the composite image outside the app window exports it as a JPEG.\n\nBelow are the various ways a drag and drop can occur that will involve either a `NSFilePromiseProvider` or a `NSFilePromiseReceiver`.\n\nDrag sent by `NSFilePromiseProvider`:\n\nDrag received by `NSFilePromiseReceiver`:\n\nIn addition, a drag and drop involves just the image file’s URL, without a file promise:\n\n### Support Image Import by Accepting File Promises\n\nWhen setting up the view that supports drag and drop, register drag types provided by [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSFilePromiseReceiver].

It does this by providing an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSFilePromiseProvider] instance to the dragging pasteboard and conforming to [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSFilePromiseProviderDelegate] by implementing three delegate methods.\n\nThis sample uses the first method to provide the title of the file.
