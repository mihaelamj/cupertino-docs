These APIs handle text rendering, text input, and user interactions, support multiple languages, and provide many features like spell checking and Writing Tools. Apps generally use these APIs to implement text editing.\n\nIn some cases, apps may desire to build a custom text editing experience by implementing a custom text engine and integrating the editor with system-provided features, such as Writing Tools.
