  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nMany methods in AppKit require you to specify color data using an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor] object; when drawing you use them to set the current fill and stroke colors. Color objects are immutable and thread-safe. You can create color objects in many ways:\n\nFor user-specified colors, you can also display a color panel and let the user specify the color. For information about color panels, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColorPanel].\n\n### Color and color spaces\n\nA color object is typically represented internally as a Core Graphics color ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreGraphics\/CGColor]) in a Core Graphics color space ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreGraphics\/CGColorSpace]). Colors can also be created in extended color spaces:\n\nWhen you need to worry about color spaces, use extended color spaces as working color spaces. When you need to worry about representing that color as closely as possible in a specific color space, convert the color from the extended color space into the target color space.\n\nWhen working in an extended color space, color values are not clamped to fit inside the color gamut, meaning that component values may be less than `0.0` or greater than `1.0`. When displayed on an sRGB display, such colors are outside the gamut and won’t render accurately. However, extended color spaces are useful as working color spaces when you want a pixel format and representation that other color spaces can be easily converted into. For example, a color in the Display P3 color space can convert to an extended sRGB format, even if it isn’t within the sRGB color gamut. While some of the converted color’s values are outside of the 0-1.0 range, the color renders correctly when viewed on a device with a P3 display gamut.\n\nIt is a programmer error to access color components of a color space that the `NSColor` object does not support. For example, you cannot access the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor\/redComponent] property and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor\/getRed(_:green:blue:alpha:)] method on a color that uses the CMYK color space. Further, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor\/getComponents(_:)] method and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor\/numberOfComponents] property work only in color spaces that have individual components. As such, they return the components of color objects as individual floating-point values regardless of whether they’re based on [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColorSpace] objects or named color spaces. However, older component-fetching methods such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor\/getRed(_:green:blue:alpha:)] are effective only on color objects based on named color spaces.\n\nIf you have a color object in an unknown color space and you want to extract its components, convert the color object to a known color space and then use the component accessor methods of that color space.\n\nFor design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines > [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/color\/].",

Color objects are immutable and thread-safe. You can create color objects in many ways:\n\n- Load colors from an asset catalog. Colors created from assets can adapt automatically to system appearance changes.\n- Use the semantic colors for custom UI elements, so that they match the appearance of other AppKit views; see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/ui-element-colors].\n- Use the adaptable system colors, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor\/systemBlue], when you want a specific tint that looks correct in both light and dark environments.\n- Create a color object from another object, such as a Core Graphics representation of a color, or a Core Image color.\n- Create a color from an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImage] object, and paint a repeating pattern instead of using a solid color.\n- Create a color by applying a transform to another [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColor] object. For example, you might perform a blend operation between two colors, or you might create a color that represents the same color, but in a different color space.\n- Create custom colors using raw component values, and a variety of color spaces, when you need to represent user-specified colors.\n\nFor user-specified colors, you can also display a color panel and let the user specify the color. For information about color panels, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSColorPanel].\n\n### Color and color spaces\n\nA color object is typically represented internally as a Core Graphics color ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreGraphics\/CGColor]) in a Core Graphics color space ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreGraphics\/CGColorSpace]).

Colors created with an exposure by NSColor create CGColors that are tagged with a contentHeadroom value. While CGColors created without a contentHeadroom tag will return 0 from CGColorGetHeadroom, NSColors generated in a similar fashion return a linearExposure of 1.0.\n- **standardDynamicRange**: In some cases it is useful to recover the color that was base the SDR color that was exposed to generate an HDR color. If a color’s `linearExposure` is > 1, then this will return the base SDR color. If the color is not an HDR color, this will return `self`.\n- **applyingContentHeadroom(_:)**: Reinterpret the color by applying a new `contentHeadroom` without changing the color components. Changing the `contentHeadroom` redefines the color relative to a different peak white, changing its behavior under tone mapping and the result of calling `standardDynamicRangeColor`. The new color will have a `contentHeadroom` >= 1.0. If called on a color with a color space that does not support extended range, or does not have an equivalent extended range counterpart, this will return `self`.\n\n## Retrieving core graphics color information\n\n- **cgColor**: The Core Graphics color object corresponding to the color.\n\n## Drawing with colors\n\n- **drawSwatch(in:)**: Draws the current color in the specified rectangle.\n- **set()**: Sets the color of subsequent drawing to the color that the color object represents.\n- **setFill()**: Sets the fill color of subsequent drawing to the color object’s color.\n- **setStroke()**: Sets the stroke color of subsequent drawing to the color object’s color.\n\n## Determining when colors change\n\n- **systemColorsDidChangeNotification**: Sent when the system colors have changed, such as through a system control panel interface.\n\n## Deprecated\n\n- **ignoresAlpha**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the app supports alpha.\n- **colorSpaceName**: The name of the color space associated with the color.\n- **usingColorSpaceName(_:)**: Creates a new color object whose color is the same as the receiver’s, except that the new color object is in the specified color space.\n- **usingColorSpaceName(_:device:)**: Creates a new color object for the same color, but in the specified color space and specific to the provided device.\n- **currentControlTintDidChangeNotification**: Sent after the user changes control tint preference.\n\n## Colors\n\n- **NSColorList**: An ordered list of color objects, identified by keys.\n- **NSColorSpace**: An object that represents a custom color space.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- Copyable\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSAccessibilityColor\n- NSCoding\n- NSCopying\n- NSObjectProtocol\n- NSPasteboardReading\n- NSPasteboardWriting\n- NSSecureCoding\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n- Transferable\n\n",
