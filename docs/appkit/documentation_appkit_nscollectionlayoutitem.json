  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn item is a blueprint for how to size, space, and arrange an individual piece of content in your collection view. An item represents a single view that’s rendered onscreen. Generally, an item is a cell, but items can be supplementary views like headers, footers, and other decorations.\n\nFor example, in the Photos app, an item might represent a single photo. In the App Store app, an item might be a cell displaying information about an individual app in a list of featured apps, such as the app icon, app name, tagline, and download button.\n\n\n\nEach item specifies its own size in terms of a width dimension and a height dimension. Items can express their dimensions relative to their container, as an absolute value, or as an estimated value that might change at runtime, like in response to a change in system font size. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSCollectionLayoutDimension].\n\nYou combine items into groups that determine how those items are arranged in relation to each other.
