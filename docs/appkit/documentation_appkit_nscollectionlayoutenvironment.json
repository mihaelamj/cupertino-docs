You can get information about the layout’s container, such as its size and content insets, and the traits of its environment, such as size classes, display scale factor, and user interface idiom. You use this information while rendering the layout’s sections to help you make decisions about how to display the layout.\n\nFor example, the following code uses the layout environment’s trait collection to check whether the UI is in Dark Mode while creating the layout’s sections.",
