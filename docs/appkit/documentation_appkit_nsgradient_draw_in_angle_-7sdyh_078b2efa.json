  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis convenience method draws a linear gradient inside the specified rectangle. The gradient is drawn so that the start and end colors are guaranteed to be visible in opposite corners of the rectangle. The angle of rotation determines which corner contains the start color; see the table below.\n\nThe gradient’s color transitions occur along the line formed by the angle of rotation. For example, a rotation of 0 degrees results in colors changing from left-to-right across the rectangle, while a rotation of 90 degrees results in colors changing from bottom to top.\n\nThe gradient drawn by this method is clipped to `rect`.",
