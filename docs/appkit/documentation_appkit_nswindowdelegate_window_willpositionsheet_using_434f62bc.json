If your window has a toolbar, for example, you can specify a location for the sheet that is just below it. If you want the sheet associated with a certain control or view, you could position the sheet so that it appears to originate from the object (through animation) or is positioned next to it.\n\nNeither the `rect` parameter nor the returned `NSRect` value define the boundary of the sheet. They indicate where the top-left edge of the sheet is attached to the window. The origin is expressed in window coordinates; the default `origin.y` value is the height of the content view and the default `origin.x` value is 0. The `size.width` value indicates the width and behavior of the initial animation; if `size.width` is narrower than the sheet, the sheet genies out from the specified location, and if `size.width` is wider than the sheet, the sheet slides out. You cannot affect the size of the sheet through the `size.width` and `size.height` fields. It is recommended that you specify zero for the `size.height` value as this field may have additional meaning in a future release.",
