Cells of this type are comprised of four fixed-size corner images along and a set of edge and center images that are used to fill the gaps between the corners. These cells allow you to create sophisticated looking controls that can grow and shrink in any direction without distorting the control’s overall appearance.\n\nYou should prefer the use of this function over your own custom code for handling multi-part images whose size can change. This function correctly manages the subtle behaviors needed to handle resolution independence issues and to avoid visual artifacts caused by tiling the various images.\n\nThis function uses the top-left and bottom-right corner images to determine the widths and heights of the edge areas that need to be filled. If the width or height of the bottom-left and top-right images are not sized appropriately, they may be scaled to fill their corner area. Edge areas between the corners are tiled using the corresponding image. Similarly, the center area is tiled using the specified center image.\n\nThe `flipped` parameter lets you reorient the contents of each image when drawing in a flipped coordinate system. By default, images use an internal coordinate system that is not flipped. Rendering such an image in a flipped coordinate system would therefore cause the image to appear upside down. Passing [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] for the `flipped` parameter adjusts the image’s internal coordinate system to draw it correctly in a flipped environment.",
