This registration forces the field editor to send a [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSTextDelegate\/textDidEndEditing(_:)] message to its delegate. The field editor is then removed from the view hierarchy, its delegate is set to `nil`, and it’s emptied of any text it may contain.\n\nThis method is typically invoked by the object using the field editor when it’s finished. Other objects normally change the first responder by simply using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow\/makeFirstResponder(_:)], which allows a field editor or other object to retain its first responder status if, for example, the user has entered an invalid value. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow\/endEditing(for:)] method should be used only as a last resort if the field editor refuses to resign first responder status. Even in this case, you should always allow the field editor a chance to validate its text and take whatever other action it needs first.
