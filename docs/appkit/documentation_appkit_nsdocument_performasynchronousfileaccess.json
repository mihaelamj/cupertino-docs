The block is passed another block, the file access completion handler, which must be invoked when the file access is complete, though it can be invoked from any thread. This method is for use with file access that might begin on one thread but continue on another before it is complete. For example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDocument\/save(to:ofType:for:completionHandler:)] uses this method instead of [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDocument\/performSynchronousFileAccess(_:)] because if it does asynchronous saving then there is no way for it to complete all of its file access before returning from the file access block.",
