Subclasses can override this property and use their implementation to determine if the view requires its panel to become the key window so that it can handle keyboard input and navigation. Such a subclass should also override [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSResponder\/acceptsFirstResponder] to return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true].\n\nThis property is also used in keyboard navigation. It determines if a mouse click should give focus to a view—that is, make it the first responder). Some views (for example, text fields) want to receive the keyboard focus when you click in them. Other views (for example, buttons) receive focus only when you tab to them. You wouldn’t want focus to shift from a textfield that has editing in progress simply because you clicked on a check box.",
