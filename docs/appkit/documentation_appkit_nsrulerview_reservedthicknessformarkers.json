If you don’t expect to have any markers on the ruler, you can set the reserved thickness to 0.0.\n\nAn NSRulerView automatically increases the reserved thickness as necessary to that of its thickest marker. If you plan to use markers of varying sizes, you should set the reserved thickness beforehand to that of the thickest one in order to avoid retiling of the NSScrollView.",
