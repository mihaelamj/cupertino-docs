The default implementation returns an empty array, but you can override it and return index paths for each decoration view you want to remove. For example, when a section is removed, you might want to remove the decoration views associated with that section. In that case, you would add index paths to the array that contain the section numbers that were removed.\n\nThe index paths you return should always contain a valid section number, but the item number is optional. The item number is necessary only if you support multiple supplementary views of the same type in a single section. If you do, your layout object can use the item numbers internally to differentiate the supplementary views.\n\nSubclasses are expected to override this method, as needed, and provide any appropriate index paths.",
