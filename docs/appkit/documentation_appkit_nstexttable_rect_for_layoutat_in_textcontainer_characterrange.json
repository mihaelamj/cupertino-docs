For top-level blocks, this is the container rectangle of `textContainer`; for nested blocks, this is the layout rectangle of the enclosing block.\n- **textContainer**: The text container being used for the layout.\n- **charRange**: The range of the characters whose glyphs are to be drawn.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe rectangle within which glyphs should be laid out.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method is called by the text table block `block` to determine the rectangle within which glyphs should be laid out for the text table block.\n\n## Determining layout rectangles\n\n- **boundsRect(for:contentRect:in:textContainer:characterRange:)**: Returns the rectangle the text table block actually occupies, including padding, borders, and margins.\n\n",
