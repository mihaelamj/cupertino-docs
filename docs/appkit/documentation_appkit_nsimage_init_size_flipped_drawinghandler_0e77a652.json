  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nAn initialized `NSImage` object.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to generate an image that is correct at any resolution. This method creates an image object with a single [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSCustomImageRep] object to manage drawing. The image representation uses the block in the `drawingHandler` parameter to do the actual drawing.\n\nWhen you draw the image for the first time, the underlying image representation executes the `drawingHandler` block. The image object caches the results according to its usual caching policies; see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImage\/cacheMode-swift.property] property. As long as the configuration of the destination graphics context does not change in a significant way, subsequent attempts to draw the image reuse the cached results whenever possible. If the pixel density or color space of the destination graphics context changes, though, the image representation throws away any caches and executes the block again to obtain a new version of the image. For example, if you drew the image on a standard resolution display but then draw it on a Retina display, AppKit executes the block again to obtain an image at the new resolution.\n\nThe most typical use for this method is to create an image based on vector-based content. In that case, your `drawingHandler` block would redraw its existing path objects when asked. If you draw a mixture of vectors and images, you need to do more work to ensure that your images are the appropriate resolution for the destination graphics context.",

The image representation copies the block and stores it for later use. It is not executed until you draw the image. Because the block is executed later, AppKit executes it on the same thread on which you draw the image itself, which can be any thread of your app. Therefore, the block must be safe to call from any thread. The block takes the following parameter:\n\n\n\nThe block returns a Boolean that indicates whether it drew the image successfully. Return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] from your block if it successfully drew the contents or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] if it did not.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn initialized `NSImage` object.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to generate an image that is correct at any resolution.
