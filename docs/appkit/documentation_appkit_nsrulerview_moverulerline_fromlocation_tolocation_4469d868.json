Use NSView’s `convert...` methods to convert coordinates from the client or document view’s coordinate system to that of the NSRulerView.\n\nThis method is useful for drawing highlight lines in the ruler to show the position or extent of an object while it’s being dragged in the client view. The sender is responsible for keeping track of the number and positions of temporary lines—the NSRulerView only does the drawing.",
