  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nThe `NSImage` object associated with the specified name or `nil` if no such image was found.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method searches for named images in several places, returning the first image it finds matching the given name. The order of the search is as follows:\n\nWhen looking for files in the app bundle, it is better (but not required) to include the filename extension in the `name` parameter. When naming an image with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImage\/setName(_:)] method, it is convention not to include filename extensions in the names you specify. That way, you can easily distinguish between images you have named explicitly and those you want to load from the app’s bundle.\n\nOne particularly useful image you can retrieve is your app’s icon. This image is set by Cocoa automatically and accessible using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImage\/applicationIconName] constant. Icons for other apps can be obtained through the use of methods declared in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWorkspace] class. You can also retrieve many of the standard system images using Cocoa defined constants; for more information, see the `Image Template Constants`, `Sharing Permissions Named Images`, `System Entity Images`, `Toolbar Named Images`, and `View Type Template Images` sections for applicable constants.\n\nIf an app is linked on macOS 10.5 or later, images requested using this method and whose name ends in the word “Template” are automatically marked as template images.\n\nThe `NSImage` class may cache a reference to the returned image object for performance in some cases. However, the class holds onto cached objects only while the object exists. If all strong references to the image are subsequently removed, the object may be quietly removed from the cache. Thus, if you plan to hold onto a returned image object, you must maintain a strong reference to it like you would any Cocoa object. You can clear an image object from the cache explicitly by calling the object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImage\/setName(_:)] method and specifying `nil` for the image name.",
