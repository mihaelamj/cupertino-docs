The default implementation restores some basic information about the document.

You can also use this method to reconfigure the document (or its associated window controller and window) to their previous appearance.\n\nFor information about using a coder object to read data from an archive, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/encoding-and-decoding-custom-types].",
