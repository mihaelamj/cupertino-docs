The default value for hugging priority, on both user interface axes, is [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSLayoutConstraint\/Priority-swift.struct\/defaultLow]. If you have not added constraints between the stack view and its enclosing view, the stack view stays as small as possible to fully contain its views—independent of the size of the view that contains it.\n\nTo configure a stack view to grow and shrink according to the size of its enclosing view, add constraints between the stack view and its enclosing view by using Auto Layout priorities higher than the hugging priority.\n\nTo configure a stack view to prevent its enclosing view from growing, use priorities for the constraints between the stack view and its enclosing view that are lower than the hugging priority.\n\nThe value of the hugging priority also affects spacing between views and between gravity areas, as described in the discussion for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSStackView\/spacing] property.",
