It neither redisplays the view nor marks it as needing display. Set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/needsDisplay] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] when you want the view to be redisplayed.\n\nThis method posts an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/boundsDidChangeNotification] to the default notification center if the view is configured to do so.\n\nAfter calling this method, `NSView` creates an internal transform (or appends these changes to an existing internal transform) to convert from frame coordinates to bounds coordinates in your view. As long as the width-to-height ratio of the two coordinate systems remains the same, your content appears normal. If the ratios differ, your content may appear skewed.",
