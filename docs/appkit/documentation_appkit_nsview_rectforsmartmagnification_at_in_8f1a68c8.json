To get the default magnification behavior, return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSZeroRect].\n\n## Discussion\n\nAppKit calls this method when magnifying content in a scroll view. If you do not override this method, or if you return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSZeroRect], the scroll view magnifies the view’s content around the specified point. If you override this method and return a custom rectangle, the scroll view adjusts the magnification behavior to accommodate the rectangle you provide.\n\nUse this method to provide AppKit with rectangles for your view’s custom content. If your view’s content can be divided into logical groups of content, use the provided `location` and `visibleRect` parameters to determine which group is being targeted and then return the rectangle that fully encloses that group. For example, a view with multiple columns of content could return the rectangle for the targeted column. The returned rectangle should always fully enclose the content, regardless of whether that rectangle is larger than the visible rectangle.",
