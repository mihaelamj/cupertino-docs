For pixel-format compatibility, `bitmapImageRep` should have been obtained from [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/bitmapImageRepForCachingDisplay(in:)].\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou are responsible for initializing the bitmap to the desired configuration before calling this method.
