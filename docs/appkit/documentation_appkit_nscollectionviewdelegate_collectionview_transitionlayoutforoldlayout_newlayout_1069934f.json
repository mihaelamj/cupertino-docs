A transition layout object lets you customize the behavior of collection view elements when transitioning from one layout to the next. Normally, transitioning between layouts causes the assorted items and views to animate from their current locations directly to their new locations. By returning a custom transition object, you could have those elements follow a nonlinear path, use a different timing algorithm, or move items in response to touch events.\n\nIf you do not implement this method in your delegate object, the collection view uses a standard [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICollectionViewTransitionLayout] object for the transition.\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nIn OS X 10.11, this method is never called by the collection view.",
