The default implementation of this method returns an empty dictionary for an `NSSaveOperation` or `NSAutosaveInPlaceOperation`, or a dictionary with an appropriate `NSFileExtensionHidden` entry for any other kind of save operation. You can override this method to customize the attributes that are written to document files.\n\nFor backward binary compatibility with OS X v10.5 and earlier, the default implementation of this method returns a dictionary with `NSFileHFSCode` and `NSFileHFSTypeCode` entries that have a value of 0 for `NSSaveOperation`, in apps linked against OS X v10.5 or earlier.\n\nFor backward binary compatibility with OS X v10.3 and earlier, the default implementation of this method instead invokes `[self fileAttributesToWriteToFile:[url path] ofType:typeName saveOperation:aSaveOperation]` if [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDocument\/fileAttributesToWriteToFile:ofType:saveOperation:] is overridden and the URL uses the `file:` scheme.

This method is meant to be used just for attributes that need to be written for the first time, for `NSSaveAsOperation` and `NSSaveToOperation`.
