The second, more general, case involves the application providing a palette of different kinds of markers that can be dragged onto the ruler, from the ruler’s accessory view or from some other place. With this technique the palette tracks the cursor until it enters the ruler view, at which time it hands over control to the ruler view by invoking [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSRulerView\/trackMarker(_:withMouseEvent:)].",
