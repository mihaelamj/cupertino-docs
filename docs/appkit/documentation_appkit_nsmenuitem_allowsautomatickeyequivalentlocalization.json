Localized keyboards sometimes rearrange punctuation marks or replace them altogether to make room for a language’s required characters. The new locations of those keys might make it difficult to use your menu item’s current shortcut. To ensure your shortcuts are always usable, the system can automatically remap shortcuts, as needed, to accommodate the connected keyboard.\n\nWhen the value of this property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], the system automatically remaps this menu item’s shortcut when that shortcut is unreachable on the current keyboard. The system doesn’t remap shortcuts when the input keys have identical positions on both keyboards, or when the shortcut is still easily reachable on the current keyboard. The remapping is transparent to your app.\n\nIf you already localize your app’s shortcuts for different languages, or if you permit someone to customize your app’s shortcuts, you can set this property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] to disable the automatic remapping behavior.
