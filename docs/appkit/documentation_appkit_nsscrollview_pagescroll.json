This value is used when the user clicks the scroll arrows while holding down the Option key.

It differs from the line scroll amount, which indicates how far the document view moves. The page scroll amount is the amount common to the content view before and after the document view is scrolled by one page. Thus, setting the page scroll amount to `0.0` implies that the entire visible portion of the document view is replaced when a page scroll occurs.\n\nNote that a scroll view can have two different page scroll amounts: [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSScrollView\/verticalPageScroll] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSScrollView\/horizontalPageScroll].
