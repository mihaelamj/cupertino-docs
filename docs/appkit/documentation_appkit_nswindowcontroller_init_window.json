The default initialization turns on cascading, sets the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindowController\/shouldCloseDocument] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], and sets the window frame autosave name to an empty string. As a side effect, the created window controller is added as an observer of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow\/willCloseNotification]s posted by that window object (which is handled by a private method). If you make the window controller a delegate of the window, you can implement NSWindow’s windowShouldClose: delegate method.",
