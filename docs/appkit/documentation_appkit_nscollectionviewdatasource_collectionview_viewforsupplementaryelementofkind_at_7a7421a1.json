You do this by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSCollectionView\/makeSupplementaryView(ofKind:withIdentifier:for:)] method of the collection view to retrieve an unconfigured view of the appropriate type. After receiving the view, update its properties and content using your app’s data structures and return it.\n\nYou do not need to set the location of supplementary views inside the collection view’s bounds. The collection view gets the view’s location and other layout-related attributes from the layout object during a separate step.",
