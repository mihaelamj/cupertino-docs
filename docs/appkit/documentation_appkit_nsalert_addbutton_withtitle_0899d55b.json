The first three buttons are identified positionally as `NSAlertFirstButtonReturn`, `NSAlertSecondButtonReturn`, `NSAlertThirdButtonReturn` in the return-code parameter evaluated by the modal delegate. Subsequent buttons are identified as `NSAlertThirdButtonReturn` +`n`, where `n` is an integer\n\nBy default, the first button has a key equivalent of Return, any button with a title of “Cancel” has a key equivalent of Escape, and any button with the title “Don’t Save” has a key equivalent of Command-D (but only if it’s *not* the first button). You can also assign different key equivalents for the buttons using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSButton\/keyEquivalent] method of the `NSButton` class. In addition, you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSControl\/tag] method of the `NSButton` class to set the return value.",
