Calling this method kicks off an update (and possible animations) to delete the specified sections. Specifically, the collection view asks the layout object for the final layout attributes for any deleted sections and may also ask for updated layout attributes for any remaining sections. If the layout attributes of any visible items changed, those changes are animated into place.\n\nWhen inserting or deleting multiple sections and items, you can animate all of your changes at once using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSCollectionView\/performBatchUpdates(_:completionHandler:)] method.",
