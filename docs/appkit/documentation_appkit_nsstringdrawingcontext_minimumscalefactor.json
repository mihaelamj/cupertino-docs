Any value greater than `0.0` is multiplied by the font point size to get the smallest font size that is permissible to use. For example, 0.5 indicates a font that is half the size of the actual font, 0.75 is three-quarters of the font size, and so on. Typically, you specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 to indicate how much the font can be shrunk during drawing.\n\nThe default value of this property is `0.0`.",
