These baselines are merely hints that your own code can use to determine positioning. The `NSImage` class does not use this rectangle during drawing; however, instances of [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSCell] typically use this information when laying out images within their boundaries.\n\nFor example, if you have a 20 x 20 pixel icon that includes a glow effect, you might set the alignment rectangle to `{{2, 2}, {16, 16}}` to indicate the position of the underlying icon without the glow effect. This property defaults to a rectangle with an origin of `{0, 0}` and a size that matches the size of the image.",
