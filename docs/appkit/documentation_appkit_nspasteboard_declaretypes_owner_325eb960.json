The types should be ordered according to the preference of the source application, with the most preferred type coming first (typically, the richest representation).\n- **newOwner**: The object responsible for writing data to the pasteboard, or `nil` if you provide data for all types immediately. If you specify a `newOwner` object, it must support all of the types declared in the `newTypes` parameter and must remain alive for as long as the data is *promised* on the pasteboard.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe receiver’s new change count.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method is the equivalent of invoking [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSPasteboard\/clearContents()], implicitly writing the first pasteboard item, and then calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSPasteboard\/addTypes(_:owner:)] to promise types for the first pasteboard item.\n\n\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nIn general, you should not use this method with [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSPasteboard\/writeObjects(_:)], since [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSPasteboard\/writeObjects(_:)] will always write additional items to the pasteboard, and will not affect items already on the pasteboard, including the item implicitly created by this method.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **clearContents()**: Clears the existing contents of the pasteboard.\n- **changeCount**: The receiver’s change count.\n\n## Writing data (macOS 10.5 and earlier)\n\n- **addTypes(_:owner:)**: Adds promises for the specified types to the first pasteboard item.\n- **writeFileContents(_:)**: Writes the contents of the specified file to the pasteboard.\n- **write(_:)**: Writes the serialized contents of the specified file wrapper to the pasteboard.\n\n",
