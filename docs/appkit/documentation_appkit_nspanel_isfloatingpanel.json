It’s appropriate for a panel to float above other windows only if all of the following conditions are true:\n\n- It’s small enough not to obscure whatever is behind it.\n- It’s oriented more to the mouse than to the keyboard—that is, if it doesn’t become the key window or becomes so only when needed.\n- It needs to remain visible while the user works in the app’s standard windows—for example, if the user must frequently move the pointer back and forth between a standard window and the panel (such as a tool palette), or if the panel gives information relevant to the user’s actions in a standard window.\n- It hides when the app is deactivated (the default behavior for panels).\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **level**: The window level of the window.\n- **Window Programming Guide**\n\n## Configuring Panels\n\n- **becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver becomes the key window only when needed.\n- **worksWhenModal**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the panel receives keyboard and mouse events even when some other window is being run modally.\n\n",
