Adopt a role-specific accessibility protocol if:\n\nFirst, identify the role-specific protocol that best matches your control’s intended behavior. For example, if your control is something that triggers actions when the user clicks it, adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSAccessibilityButton] protocol.\n\nAfter you select an appropriate protocol, adopt that protocol. The compiler may ask you to reimplement some of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSAccessibilityProtocol] protocol’s accessor or action methods. Simply implement these methods, and your control is ready to use.",

Adopt a role-specific accessibility protocol if:\n\n- You’re creating a custom control that’s a subclass of [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView], and you want to modify the control’s behavior beyond what AppKit provides by default.\n- You’re working with a specialized control that doesn’t subclass [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView]. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSAccessibilityElement-swift.class] first.\n\nFirst, identify the role-specific protocol that best matches your control’s intended behavior. For example, if your control is something that triggers actions when the user clicks it, adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSAccessibilityButton] protocol.\n\nAfter you select an appropriate protocol, adopt that protocol. The compiler may ask you to reimplement some of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSAccessibilityProtocol] protocol’s accessor or action methods. Simply implement these methods, and your control is ready to use.\n\n## Buttons\n\n- **NSAccessibilityButton**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a button.\n- **NSAccessibilityRadioButton**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a radio button.\n- **NSAccessibilitySwitch**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a switch.\n- **NSAccessibilityCheckBox**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a checkbox.\n\n## Value Controls\n\n- **NSAccessibilityStepper**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a stepper.\n- **NSAccessibilitySlider**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a slider.\n\n## Groups\n\n- **NSAccessibilityGroup**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary to act as a container for other user interface elements.\n\n## Lists\n\n- **NSAccessibilityTable**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a table view.\n- **NSAccessibilityList**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a list view.\n- **NSAccessibilityOutline**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as an outline view.\n- **NSAccessibilityRow**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a row for a table, list, or outline view.\n\n## Text\n\n- **NSAccessibilityStaticText**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as static text.\n- **NSAccessibilityNavigableStaticText**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as navigable static text.\n\n## Images and Color\n\n- **NSAccessibilityImage**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as an image.\n- **NSAccessibilityColor**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a color.\n\n## Loading\n\n- **NSAccessibilityProgressIndicator**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a progress indicator.\n- **NSAccessibilityElementLoading**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to support loading.\n\n## Dynamic Elements\n\n- **NSAccessibilityContainsTransientUI**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to support dynamic UI changes.\n\n## Layout Elements\n\n- **NSAccessibilityLayoutArea**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a layout area.\n- **NSAccessibilityLayoutItem**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary for an accessibility element to act as a layout item.\n\n## Supporting Types\n\n- **NSAccessibilityElementProtocol**: A role-based protocol that declares the minimum interface necessary to interact with an assistive app.\n\n## Custom View Subclasses\n\n- **Accessibility Functions**: Global accessibility functions for custom views and controls.\n\n",
