When the returned delegate is connected to a text field, all suggestion items provided from the first suggestions delegate appear before all those from the second suggestions delegate, visually separated by a separator.\n- **appending(_:)**: Returns a new text suggestions delegate of a different, but `Hashable` suggestion item type with the items and behaviors of the receiving delegate and `other` concatenated. When the returned delegate is connected to a text field, all suggestion items provided from the first suggestions delegate appear before all those from the second suggestions delegate, visually separated by a separator.\n- **textField(_:didSelect:)**: Called when an item in the suggestions menu has been selected.\n- **textField(_:provideUpdatedSuggestions:)**: Called when the text field’s text (or tokens) have changed and when the text field is going to display a new list of suggestion items.\n- **textField(_:textCompletionFor:)**: Returns the full completion text for a particular item to use when the item is highlighted or selected.\n\n## Type Aliases\n\n- **NSTextSuggestionsDelegate.Item**: A suggestion item with the same suggestion item type as the delegate.\n- **NSTextSuggestionsDelegate.ItemResponse**: A suggestion item response with the same generic type as the delegate.\n- **NSTextSuggestionsDelegate.ItemSection**: A suggestion item section with the same suggestion item type as the controller.\n\n## Supporting Text Completion and Suggestions\n\n- **isAutomaticTextCompletionEnabled**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the text field automatically completes text as the user types.\n- **NSSuggestionItem**: The items that appear in suggestion menus.\n- **NSSuggestionItemResponse**: Describes the result of a batch of suggestion items from a search\n- **NSSuggestionItemSection**: Describes a section of suggestions items in a suggestions menu\n\n",
