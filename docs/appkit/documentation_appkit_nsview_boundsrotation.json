Rotation is performed around the coordinate system origin, (0.0, 0.0), which need not coincide with that of the frame rectangle or the bounds rectangle.

Set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/needsDisplay] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] when you want the view to be redisplayed.\n\nBounds rotation affects the orientation of the drawing within the view object’s frame rectangle, but not the orientation of the frame rectangle itself. Also, for a rotated bounds rectangle to enclose all the visible areas of its view object—that is, to guarantee coverage over the frame rectangle—it must also contain some areas that aren’t visible. This can cause unnecessary drawing to be requested, which may affect performance. It may be better in many cases to rotate the coordinate system in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView\/draw(_:)] method rather than use this method.\n\nAfter changing the value of this property, the view creates an internal transform (or appends these changes to an existing internal transform) to convert from frame coordinates to bounds coordinates in your view.
