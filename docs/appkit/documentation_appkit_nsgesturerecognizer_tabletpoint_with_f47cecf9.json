Tablet-point events describe the current state of a pointing device that is in proximity to its tablet, reflecting changes such as location, pressure, tilt, and rotation. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSEvent].\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe default implementation of this method does nothing.

The gesture recognizer receives events before any views do.\n\n## Methods for Subclasses\n\n- **reset()**: Overridden to reset the internal state of the gesture recognizer when an attempt completes.\n- **mouseDown(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user pressed the left mouse button.\n- **mouseDragged(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user moved the mouse with the left button pressed.\n- **mouseUp(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user released the left mouse button.\n- **otherMouseDown(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user pressed a mouse button other than the left or right one.\n- **otherMouseDragged(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user moved the mouse with a button other than the left or right one pressed.\n- **otherMouseUp(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user released a mouse button other than the left or right one.\n- **rightMouseDown(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user pressed the right mouse button.\n- **rightMouseDragged(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user moved the mouse with the right button pressed.\n- **rightMouseUp(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user released the right mouse button.\n- **magnify(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user is performing a pinch gesture.\n- **rotate(with:)**: Informs the gesture recognizer that the user is performing a rotation gesture.\n- **canBePrevented(by:)**: Overridden to indicate that the specified gesture recognizer can prevent the current object from recognizing a gesture.\n- **canPrevent(_:)**: Overridden to indicate that the current object can prevent the specified gesture recognizer from recognizing its gesture.\n- **shouldBeRequiredToFail(by:)**: Overridden to indicate that the current object must fail before the specified gesture recognizer begins recognizing its gesture.\n\n",
