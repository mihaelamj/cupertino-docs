This is the screen that contains the menu bar and whose origin is at the point `(0, 0)`. In the case of mirroring, the first screen is the largest drawable display; if all screens are the same size, it is the screen with the highest pixel depth. This primary screen may not be the same as the one returned by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSScreen\/main] method, which returns the screen with the active window.\n\nThe array should not be cached. Screens can be added, removed, or dynamically reconfigured at any time.
