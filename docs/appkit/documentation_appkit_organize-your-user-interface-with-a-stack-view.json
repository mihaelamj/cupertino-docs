You embed a stack view inside an `NSScrollView` object, making the stack’s content scrollable when the user resizes the window. This sample shows how to use `NSStackView` with each individual view either disclosed (expanded) or hidden (collapsed).\n\nThe sample’s architecture uses the following protocols:\n\n- `StackItemHeader`. Represents the header’s view and its ability to expand and collapse its corresponding stack item body.\n- `StackItemBody`. Represents the stack item’s primary interface.\n- `StackItemContainer`. Represents each stack item, combining both the header view and the body view.\n- `StackItemHost`. Discloses each stack item container.\n\nThe following code shows the `StackItemContainer` class and its associated header and body components:\n\n```swift\nclass StackItemContainer {\n    \/\/ Disclosure state of this container.\n    var state: NSControl.StateValue\n    \n    let header: StackItemHeader\n    let body: StackItemBody\n    \n    init(header: StackItemHeader, body: StackItemBody) {\n        self.header = header\n        self.body = body\n        self.state = .on\n    }\n```\n\nThis design simplifies adding stack items as view controllers.

The disclosure states of all stack view containers are also restored. Each body view controller saves and restores various parts of its user interface.\n\nTo restore the states of stack view items, add the `NSRestorableState` to each item’s view controller:\n\n- `FormViewController`. Restores the form field text content.\n- `TableViewController`. Restores the table view’s selection.\n- `CollectionViewController`. Restores the collection view’s selection.\n\nFor `FormViewController`, restoration looks like this:\n\n```swift\n\/\/\/ Encode state. Helps save the restorable state of this view controller.\noverride func encodeRestorableState(with coder: NSCoder) {\n    \n    coder.encode(textField.stringValue, forKey: FormViewController.formTextKey)\n    super.encodeRestorableState(with: coder)\n}\n\n\/\/\/ Decode state.
