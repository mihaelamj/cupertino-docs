The default implementation does nothing but specific subclasses (such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSView] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWindow]) override it and save important state information. Therefore, if you override this method, you should always call `super` at some point in your implementation.\n\nSubclasses can override this method and use it to restore any information that was saved in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSResponder\/encodeRestorableState(with:)] method. You can also use this method to reconfigure the responder to its previous appearance.\n\nFor information about using a coder object to read data from an archive, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/encoding-and-decoding-custom-types].",
