This option is called Momentary Light in Interface Builder’s Button inspector.\n\n## Deprecated Button Types\n\n- **NSPushOnPushOffButton**: When the button is clicked (on state), it appears illuminated. If the button has borders, it may also appear recessed. A second click returns it to its normal (off) state.\n- **NSToggleButton**: After the first click, the button displays its alternate image or title (on state); a second click returns the button to its normal (off) state.\n- **NSSwitchButton**: This style is a variant of `NSToggleButton` that has no border and is typically used to represent a checkbox.\n- **NSRadioButton**: This style is similar to `NSSwitchButton`, but it is used to constrain a selection to a single element from several elements.\n- **NSMomentaryChangeButton**: When the button is clicked, the alternate (on state) image and alternate title are displayed.\n- **NSOnOffButton**: The first click highlights the button; a second click returns it to the normal (unhighlighted) state.\n- **NSAcceleratorButton**: A button that sends an action when the user first clicks the button and continues sending actions until the user releases pressure entirely.\n- **NSMultiLevelAcceleratorButton**: A multilevel accelerator button is a variation of a normal accelerator button that allows for a configurable number of stepped pressure levels. As each one is reached, the user receives light tactile feedback and an action is sent.\n- **NSMomentaryPushInButton**: When the user clicks the button (on state), the button appears illuminated.\n- **NSMomentaryPushButton**: When the button is clicked (on state), it appears illuminated. If the button has a bordered, it may also appear recessed. When the button is released, it returns to its normal (off) state.\n- **NSMomentaryLight**: When the button is clicked (on state), it appears illuminated.\n\n",
