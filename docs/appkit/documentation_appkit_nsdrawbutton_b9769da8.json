Since this function is often used to draw the border of a view, the `aRect` parameter typically contains the view’s bounds rectangle. For an Aqua button, use an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appkit\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSButton] object instead.\n\nThis function fills the specified rectangle with light gray. This function is designed for rectangles that are defined in unscaled, unrotated coordinate systems (that is, where the y axis is vertical, the x axis is horizontal, and a unit along either axis is equal to 1 screen pixel). The coordinate system can be either flipped or unflipped. The sides of the rectangle should lie on pixel boundaries.",
