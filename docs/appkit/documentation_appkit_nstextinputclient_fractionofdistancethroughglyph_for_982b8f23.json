May be 0 or 1 if `aPoint` is not within the bounding rectangle of a glyph (0 if the point is to the left or above the glyph; 1 if it’s to the right or below).\n\n## Discussion\n\nImplementation of this method is optional. This allows caller to perform precise selection handling.\n\nFor purposes such as dragging out a selection or placing the insertion point, a partial percentage less than or equal to 0.5 indicates that `aPoint` should be considered as falling before the glyph; a partial percentage greater than 0.5 indicates that it should be considered as falling after the glyph. If the nearest glyph doesn’t lie under `aPoint` at all (for example, if `aPoint` is beyond the beginning or end of a line), this ratio is 0 or 1.\n\nFor example, if the glyph stream contains the glyphs “A” and “b”, with the width of “A” being 13 points, and `aPoint` is 8 points from the left side of “A”, then the fraction of the distance is 8\/13, or 0.615. In this case, the `aPoint` should be considered as falling between “A” and “b” for purposes such as dragging out a selection or placing the insertion point.",
