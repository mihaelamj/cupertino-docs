The app handles the playback on each device, but the Group Activities framework synchronizes that playback and facilitates communication between the devices.\n\nThis framework leverages the FaceTime infrastructure to synchronize your app’s activities and to invite other participants to join those activities. When your app’s UI contains shareable activities, adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity] protocol in the objects you use to represent those activities.
