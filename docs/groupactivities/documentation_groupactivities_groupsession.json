  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA `GroupSession` object contains details about the user’s currently selected activity, its status, and its participants. When a participant engages in an activity, the system binds a session to that activity for you. You use the session object to synchronize your app’s activity-related content, including your app’s UI.\n\nYou don’t create `GroupSession` objects directly. Instead, the system creates sessions and makes them available to your app asynchronously. Use the `AsyncSequence` type returned by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity\/sessions()] method of your activity to retrieve new sessions when they become available.\n\nBefore the system can create a session object, your app must create a `GroupActivity` object and activate it. For information about how to configure group activities, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity].\n\n### Start and Stop the Session\n\nWhen you receive a new session object, it’s initially in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/State-swift.enum\/waiting] state. As soon as your app is ready to begin the associated activity, call the session’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/join()] method. Joining a session validates the connection and starts the synchronization process between the current device and other participants’ devices. If your app successfully joins the session, the session transitions to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/State-swift.enum\/joined] state.\n\nWhen the user quits your app, or navigates away from the shared activity, call the session’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/leave()] method. Leaving a session gracefully transitions it to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/State-swift.enum\/invalidated(reason:)] state, and informs the system that the user isn’t currently engaged in the activity.",
