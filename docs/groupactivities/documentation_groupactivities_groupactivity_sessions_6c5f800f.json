The method returns a sequence that may contain some or none of its values when you access it. The system adds an element to the sequence when the participant joins a new activity. It doesn’t update the sequence when properties of an active session change. For example, it doesn’t update the sequence when the state of the session changes.\n\nUse a `for`-`in` loop to iterate over the values in the sequence. Preface your loop with `await` to receive each value asynchronously as it becomes available. To avoid blocking your code, perform the iteration from an asynchronous task in your app. The following example shows a typical way to call this method asynchronously:\n\nWhen a new session arrives, use it to prepare your app’s UI for the new activity.",
