A journal object isn’t a replacement for a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSessionMessenger] object, which you use to transfer time-sensitive messages and commands between participants. Instead, use it to associate files and other data objects with the activity. For example, you might share images that people drag into your app as part of the activity. The journal makes these data objects available to all participants, regardless of when they joined the session.\n\nAfter your app joins an activity and receives a session object, create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSessionJournal] object and store a strong reference to it. To add a file or data object to the group’s journal, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSessionJournal\/add(_:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSessionJournal\/add(_:metadata:)] method with the data you want to share. The types you specify must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/Transferable] protocol from the Core Transferable framework. The journal object uses that protocol to package a version of your data suitable for sending to other devices.\n\nTo receive data that a participant added to the journal, configure a task to listen for asynchronous updates to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSessionJournal\/attachments-swift.property] property of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSessionJournal] object.
