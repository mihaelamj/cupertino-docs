  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen one person in a group starts an activity, other people’s devices display system UI to prompt them to join that activity.  When each person joins, the system prepares a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] object for the activity and delivers it to their app. Your app uses that session object to:\n\n\n\nFor information about how to define activities, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/defining-your-apps-shareplay-activities]. For information about how to start activities, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/promoting-shareplay-activities-from-your-apps-ui].\n\n### Join an activity from a background task\n\nActivities can start at any time, so you need to set up an asynchronous handler in your app to listen for when they start. After a participant joins an activity, the system creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] object and delivers it to the sessions property of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity] type you defined. Monitor the sessions property from an asynchronous handler, and process new session objects when they become available.\n\nConfigure separate asynchronous handlers for each of your app’s activity types, and use each one to receive new sessions for their activity. In SwiftUI, create your handler by adding the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/task(priority:_:)] modifier to the view containing the UI for the activity, as shown in the example below. Inside the block for the task modifier, wait on the activity’s sessions property using a `for..in` loop. The sessions property contains an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/AsyncSequence] type, which wakes up the task and executes your code when a new session arrives. Use your code to begin the activity in your app.\n\nIf you’re not using SwiftUI, handle the arrival of sessions using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Task] block, as shown in the following example. This block offers the same behavior as the SwiftUI task modifier, and you use it in similar ways. When a new session arrives, update your app’s UI to reflect the current activity, or perform any other tasks you need to prepare for the activity.\n\nSave a reference to any sessions you receive asynchronously and remove those references when the session state changes to [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/State-swift.enum\/invalidated(reason:)]. The system delivers one new session for each joined activity. When the state of the session changes, or when other properties change, the system updates the already delivered session. To detect updates while the session is active, add subscribers to the properties of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] object.\n\n### Prepare your app’s interface\n\nWhen your app receives a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] object, start preparing your app’s UI immediately. The activity doesn’t start until you call the join method of the session object you received. However, don’t call that method until you’re ready to display the UI for the activity itself. If your app needs to collect login credentials or download content before starting the activity, present the UI for those tasks and wait for them to complete before you call the join method.\n\nAfter you join an activity, update your UI as needed to reflect relevant information. In particular:\n\n### Join the session to start the activity\n\nWhen your app has everything it needs and is ready to start the activity, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/join()] method of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] object. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/join()] method asks the system to start the activity in your app.\nEven after you call this method, the session remains in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/State-swift.enum\/waiting] state until the system establishes a connection to the activity.\n\nIf your call to [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/join()] is successful, the system changes the state of the session to [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/State-swift.enum\/joined] and begins sending information to and from the current device. If you tried to synchronize data after calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/join()], but before the system completed the request, those requests remain queued until your session enters the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/State-swift.enum\/joined] state. After successfully joining the session, the system expects you to handle session-related changes and messages. For information about how to send messages between participants, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/synchronizing-data-during-a-shareplay-activity].\n\n### Accommodate people who arrive late to the session\n\nParticipants join activities separately, and people can join immediately or after a delay.  If participants need to download your app, or don’t see the invitation to join the activity, they might arrive several minutes after others. If your activity manages state information that all participants require, devise a way to deliver that information to someone who arrives late. For example, a whiteboard app needs to deliver the current whiteboard content to any late joiners.\n\nConsider the experience for people who arrive late to an activity, and plan for it when implementing your activity support. You might create a lobby interface where participants wait until everyone is present, or you might define custom messages to let people catch up with the rest of the group. Choose an experience that makes sense for your app, and remember that every participant is equal in a SharePlay activity. There’s no single activity owner who controls the experience.\n\nTo determine when new participants join the session, monitor the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/activeParticipants] property of the session using a separate task. When the list of participants changes, compare the new list with a saved copy your app maintains. When you detect new participants, update them with the current state of the activity.\n\n### End the activity for one or more participants\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] object contains methods to end the session for the current participant or the entire group. When designing your UI, make it clear which option someone is choosing, and call the correct method in response.\n\n\n\nWhen a participant quits your app, switches to a different app, or navigates away from your app’s activity-related UI, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/leave()]  to end the activity for that participant. Other participants remain engaged in the activity until they leave or until someone ends the activity for everyone.\n\nWhen a participant leaves an activity, the system moves their session to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/State-swift.enum\/invalidated(reason:)] state and stops the flow of information between their device and the rest of the group. When the session moves to this state, it’s safe to discard the session object itself and perform any activity-related cleanup. If the person is still active on the FaceTime call or Messages conversation and rejoins the activity later, the system delivers a new session object to your app.\n\nWhen you want to end the activity for everyone, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/end()] method. This method invalidates the sessions for all participants. Make sure any buttons or UI that calls this method makes it clear that the activity ends for everyone. The session also ends when everyone leaves the activity.",

This block offers the same behavior as the SwiftUI task modifier, and you use it in similar ways.

In particular:\n\n- Provide a way for people to see who joined the activity, and who hasn’t joined. Some people might not join an activity right away, because they don’t have the app or are doing something else. Keeping everyone informed lets them know who’s aware of the activity details.\n- Provide visual cues when someone makes a change, and optionally display information about who made the change. For example, annotate the change temporarily with the person’s identity, or add app-specific messages to the conversation.\n- Support people navigating away from an activity but staying on the group FaceTime call or Messages conversation. For activities that involve video playback, support Picture in Picture to continue playback even when someone changes apps.\n- Make sure app-specific controls are easy to access.\n\n### Join the session to start the activity\n\nWhen your app has everything it needs and is ready to start the activity, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/join()] method of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] object.
