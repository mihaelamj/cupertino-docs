The protocol provides the system with the context and metadata to start an activity-related session. For example, the protocol defines the unique identity of the activity, and returns information about the activity.\n\nIn addition to the protocol’s methods and properties, make sure your type includes the information you need to start the activity. When a participant accepts an activity, the system provides a copy of your activity type. You must use that type to begin the activity. For example, use it to present the appropriate UI for the activity and to load any required content.\n\nTo initiate an activity, create an instance of your custom type and call its [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity\/prepareForActivation()] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity\/activate()] method. You might call one of these methods from a button in your app’s UI, or in response to other user actions. If activation succeeds, the system advertises the activity on the current FaceTime call.\n\nWhen an activity begins, the system creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] instance for the activity and delivers it asynchronously to your app. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity\/sessions()] method to get the session and configure your app’s UI.",
