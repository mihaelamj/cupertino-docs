  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nSharePlay activities are an organic way to create experiences that people can enjoy together. When you add the Group Activities framework to your app, you gain the ability to share your app’s features over FaceTime, Messages, and AirDrop. Some examples of experiences people can share together include:\n\nConsider the preceding list of activities, and any other activities your app supports, and build SharePlay support for them. Think about how people might enjoy those activities if they were together in the same physical space. Consider the types of interactions that can occur in the real world, and build support for those interactions into your activities. For example, a movie-watching app needs to pause playback for all participants when one person hits the pause button. A shared whiteboard app needs to transmit newly drawn content to other participants, and send all of the content to someone who arrives late.\n\n### Configure the SharePlay entitlements\n\nBefore you start adding SharePlay support to your app, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.group-session] entitlement to your Xcode project. Because SharePlay involves communication with other devices, you need this entitlement to support activities. To add the entitlement to your app:\n\nConfigure this entitlement only for app targets. When you add the Group Activities capability, Xcode adds the necessary entitlements to your app and updates its provisioning profile.\n\n### Turn an existing app feature into an activity\n\nTurn one of your app’s features into a SharePlay experience by adopting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity] protocol in the appropriate place in your code. This protocol provides the basic definition of a SharePlay activity. When you adopt it in one of your app’s existing types, that type provides the information that SharePlay needs to promote that activity to participants. If you prefer to keep the activity separate from your app data structures, define a new type and add any app-specific data you need to manage the activity.\n\nMost of the content in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity] type is the data you use to support the activity itself. Include data that is critical for performing the activity, such as the URL of the movie in a movie-watching activity. Also, include information to support the overall experience, such as the name of the movie and an image to display in the SharePlay UI. Store as little data as possible to support the activity, and share state information instead of detailed changes wherever possible. For example, store a link to the movie instead of the movie file itself. The following example defines a `Movie` type that stores information about a movie to watch, and a group activity to share the experience:\n\n### Customize the unique identifier for your activity\n\nTo differentiate one activity from another, each [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity] type must have a unique string in its [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity\/activityIdentifier] property. The default implementation of this property combines your app’s bundle identifier with the name of your custom [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity] type. This string is sufficient for most activity types, but you can also specify a custom value if you prefer.\n\nIf you specify a custom string, include your company name in reverse-DNS format along with any other information you need to distinguish the activity from others in your app. The following code adds a custom identifier for the `WatchTogether` activity:\n\nMake activity identifiers as granular as needed to differentiate the activities within your app. Don’t create one activity type that serves multiple purposes. Instead, define separate types and give them unique activity identifiers. For example, if your video player supports playing both movies and television shows, create separate activities for each.\n\n### Provide descriptive information about the activity\n\nEach activity contains a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivityMetadata] type that stores descriptive information about the activity. When inviting people to join the activity, the system incorporates this metadata into the system UI. A concise title, a short description of the activity, and an image help people understand which activity they’re joining. You can also provide additional details, such as a fallback URL that someone can use to join the activity from a web browser.\n\nCreate a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivityMetadata] type dynamically from your activity, and populate it with activity-related details. Fill in as much of the information as possible, and make your descriptions concise and clear. People need to quickly identify the purpose of the activity and whether it’s one they want to join, so make sure your descriptions are clear enough for someone to make a decision. The following example creates the metadata for the `WatchTogether` activity and populates it with the movie details. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivityMetadata\/fallbackURL] property to provide a URL to the content in case a participant doesn’t have the app.\n\nClassify your app’s activities by specifying an appropriate value for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivityMetadata\/type] property of [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivityMetadata]. In the SharePlay banner, the system displays an icon that matches the type of the activity. The icon provides an additional visual cue about what people can expect from the activity.\n\n### Include a transferable representation of your activity\n\nThe Core Transferable framework helps you build data types that you can easily transfer between different processes or devices. In particular, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/Transferable] protocol makes it easy to support pasteboard operations and drag and drop. The Group Activities framework supports this protocol by letting you associate a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivity] with one of your transferable types. SwiftUI and SharePlay via AirDrop also take advantage of this association to present possible activities from your UI.\n\nIf you initialize an activity using one of your app’s data types, adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/Transferable] protocol in that data type and include a transfer representation for the activity. Implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/Transferable\/transferRepresentation] property of the protocol, and include a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivityTransferRepresentation] structure in addition to any representations you use to support the pasteboard. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivityTransferRepresentation] structure to initialize an activity using the current data type. For example, the following code creates an activity to watch a movie for a custom `Movie` type:\n\nWhen you include a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ShareLink] view in your SwiftUI interface, you can specify your transferable data type as the shareable item from that view. When someone taps or clicks the link, the system displays a share sheet with options for sharing the data. If you include a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivityTransferRepresentation] type, the sheet includes an option to start the associated activity. The following example creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ShareLink] view using the `Movie` data type:\n\nFor more information on displaying a share sheet or supporting SharePlay via AirDrop, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/promoting-shareplay-activities-from-your-apps-ui].",

When you add the Group Activities framework to your app, you gain the ability to share your app’s features over FaceTime, Messages, and AirDrop. Some examples of experiences people can share together include:\n\n- Watching or listening to content\n- Participating in an online fitness class\n- Creating content on a shared whiteboard or painter’s canvas\n- Shopping for food, clothes, or other online products\n- Planning a trip or browsing the web\n- Reading a book or taking an online class\n\nConsider the preceding list of activities, and any other activities your app supports, and build SharePlay support for them.
