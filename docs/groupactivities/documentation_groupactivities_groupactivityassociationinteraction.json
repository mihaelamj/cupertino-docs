This association between the group activity and a scene in your app creates a shared space for the spatial Personas to interact in; enabling participants to gesture at the associated scene and understand each other. For more information about spatial Personas and SharePlay on visionOS, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/adding-spatial-persona-support-to-an-activity].\n\nBy default, the system uses your scene’s activation conditions in concert with your activity’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/SceneAssociationBehavior] to select a primary scene to associate with the activity. You can specify a different scene or dynamically change the primary associated scene by adding this interaction to a view and specifying that view as the `GroupActivityAssociationKind\/primary` group activity association.\n\nTo add the interaction to a view, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/addInteraction(_:)].\n\nIf there are multiple scenes that are simultaneously configured with the primary group activity association, the most recently associated scene will be used. For example, if your app defines two windows and both contain views with the primary association kind, the most recently opened one will be used as the primary scene. If that second window is subsequently closed, the original window will be used again.\n\nYou can dynamically disable the group activity association of a view by setting the optional `associationKind` property to `nil`. You can later re-associate it by setting the `associationKind` to `.primary`.",
