The default value of this property is `false`.\n\nAn immersive space places a person in their own private experience. To prevent the disruption of that experience, the system disables spatial Personas by default when any immersive space is open. Setting this property to `true` tells the system that it can once again display spatial Personas when an immersive space is open.\n\nWhen displaying spatial Personas in an immersive space, the system establishes a shared coordinate space among the participants. Specifically, the system moves the origin of the coordinate space to a shared location, which it derives from the template in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/SystemCoordinator\/Configuration-swift.struct\/spatialTemplatePreference] property. Any content you place in the immersive space subsequently appears in the correct relative location from each participant’s perspective. To place content in front of a specific participant, use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GeometryReader3D] object to read the geometry of your scene. The doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/swiftui\/geometryproxy3d\/immersivespacedisplacement(in:) method of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GeometryProxy3D] provides you with the offset from the current participant to the shared origin, which you can use to position your content.",
