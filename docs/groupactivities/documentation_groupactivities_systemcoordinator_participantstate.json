When that happens, share any extra activity-related details that preserve the shared context of the scene. For example, when one person scrolls the content in a shared window, communicate the new scroll position as an activity update. When your app receives those extra updates, apply them only if the current spatial Persona is also active.\n\nObserve the participant’s spatial state from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/SystemCoordinator\/localParticipantState] property of your session’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/SystemCoordinator] object.
