If no FaceTime call is active, the view controller also displays a people picker to let the person select the participants for the activity. When they choose to start the activity, the view controller automatically starts the FaceTime call as needed and joins your app to the activity.\n\nIf your app’s interface includes controls to start SharePlay activities, present this view controller in response to interactions with those controls. Initialize the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupActivitySharingController-4gtfk] object with the activity you want to start. After you present it, the view controller handles all further interactions. It manages the interface that appears onscreen and responds when someone chooses to start or cancel the activity.
