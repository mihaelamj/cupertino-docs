In visionOS, the system can present a SharePlay activity as if the participants were together in the same room with the content. Each participant views the content from a particular vantage point, and sees the changes that others make. The system handles the placement of each participant’s spatial Persona relative to the content, but you handle any changes to the content itself with the help of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/SystemCoordinator] object.\n\nYou don’t create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/SystemCoordinator] object directly. After you receive a [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession] object for an activity, retrieve the system coordinator from the session’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/GroupSession\/systemCoordinator] property. When you first retrieve the object, update its [doc:\/\/com.apple.GroupActivities\/documentation\/GroupActivities\/SystemCoordinator\/configuration-swift.property] property to tell the system how you want to arrange participants in the scene. After that, use the information in the system coordinator’s properties to keep your app’s interface up to date. When participants support spatial placement, send additional data to synchronize your content for those participants. For example, when one person scrolls the contents of a window, update the scroll position in the window of other spatially aware participants to preserve the shared context for everyone.\n\nYou choose what information to share among participants, and you choose how to manage the corresponding updates. A system coordinator object only helps you know when to make those changes. Observe the object’s published properties to receive automatic updates when the values change.",
