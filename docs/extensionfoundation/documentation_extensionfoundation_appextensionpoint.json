To declare an extension point your app supports, extend this type by adding a static variable with the details of your extension point. Annotate your variable with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.extensionfoundation\/documentation\/ExtensionFoundation\/AppExtensionPoint\/Definition] property wrapper and specify the name and other attributes of your extension point. The following example adds two extension point with different configurations:\n\nIn addition to defining your app’s extension points, use this type in an app extension to bind to an extension point. In your app extension’s source code, add a variable that contains the `AppExtensionPoint` type. Set the value of that variable to the extension point identifier you support. Annotate your variable declaration with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.extensionfoundation\/documentation\/ExtensionFoundation\/AppExtensionPoint\/Bind] property wrapper, as shown in the following example:\n\nTo make extension point and binding information available at runtime, use the compiler to add the relevant information to your built products. In your Xcode project, add the `EX_ENABLE_EXTENSION_POINT_GENERATION` flag to the build settings of your host app and app extension. When the value of the flag is `true`, the compiler collects the target’s extension point definitions or bindings and writes them to the target’s bundle. For example, it creates a special file in the host app’s bundle and adds the extension point definitions to that file. The system collects definition and binding information at installation time and uses it to match the host app to relevant app extensions.",
