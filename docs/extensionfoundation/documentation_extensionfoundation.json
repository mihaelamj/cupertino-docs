  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn app extension is an executable code bundle that extends the capabilities of the system, or the capabilities of another app. At the system level, app extensions give you a way to add your custom capabilities to system features. For example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Creating-a-Widget-Extension] display your app’s content in specific locations like the iOS Home Screen and Lock screen. To build app extensions for system features, you typically use a different framework or a dedicated set of types instead of this framework.\n\nAdopt the `ExtensionFoundation` framework directly when you want to add support for app extensions to your own apps. An app extension model gives you a way to extend your app’s capabilities safely in several ways. If your app needs to run risky code, you might isolate that code in an app extension to prevent it from affecting the rest of your app. Alternatively, a productivity app might give other developers a way to create app extensions that extend the app’s core feature set.\n\nHost apps use the `ExtensionFoundation` framework to find and launch available app extensions. App extensions use this framework to communicate with the host app and support non-UI features. If your app also integrates custom UI from its app extensions, adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ExtensionKit] framework in addition to this one.",
