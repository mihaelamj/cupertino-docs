  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nShazamKit uses the unique acoustic *signature* of an audio recording to find a match. This signature captures the time-frequency distribution of the audio signal energy, and is much smaller than the original audio. It’s also a one-way conversion, so it’s not possible to convert the signature back to the recording.\n\nShazamKit generates a *reference signature* for each searchable full audio recording. A *catalog* stores the reference signatures and their associated metadata, or *media items*.\n\nSearching for a match compares a *query signature*, which ShazamKit generates for captured audio, with the reference signatures in the catalog. Matches occur when the query signature sufficiently matches a part of a reference signature. Matches can occur even when the captured audio is noisy, such as with a partial recording of background music playing in a restaurant.\n\nThe figure below illustrates matching a query signature with the reference signature in the catalog. The information for a match includes the timecode in the reference recording that matches the start of the query.\n\n\n\nFor example, the Shazam app converts the sound stream from a device’s microphone into a query signature and searches for a match in the Shazam music catalog. The match includes the metadata for the reference signature, such as the song title, artist name, and other details.\n\nYou can create a custom catalog with your own reference signatures and their associated metadata. For example, the catalog for a virtual learning app might contain reference signatures for teaching videos, and the associated metadata that includes the timecodes for questions. Using ShazamKit, the app identifies the current question by the timecode for the match, and can offer choices for a possible answer. If the student skips forward or backward in the video, the app updates according to the sound of what the student is watching.",
