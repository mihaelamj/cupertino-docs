However, a delegate can implement this method to customize how transactions are handled. This method returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] to indicate that the custom implementation handled the transaction and returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] to have the provider execute the transaction normally—as if the delegate did not implement this method. For example, given a transaction consisting of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXSetHeldCallAction] object and a [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXSetGroupCallAction] object, the delegate may override this method to inject a 30 second wait and play hold music to the caller.",
