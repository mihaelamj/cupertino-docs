Later in the same call, other properties may change; for example, a call may be upgraded from audio only to audio and video, which would be reflected by a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXCallUpdate] object with its [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXCallUpdate\/hasVideo] property set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true].\n\nWhen an incoming call is received, you construct a [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXCallUpdate] object specifying a [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXCallUpdate\/localizedCallerName] and pass that to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXProvider\/reportNewIncomingCall(with:update:completion:)] method to notify the telephony provider.\n\nWhen an active call is updated, you construct a [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXCallUpdate] object specifying any updated information and pass that to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXProvider\/reportCall(with:updated:)] method.
