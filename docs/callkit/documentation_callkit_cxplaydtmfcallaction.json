Whenever digits are transmitted during a call, whether from a user interacting with a number pad or following a hard or soft pause, the provider sends [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXProviderDelegate\/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt] to its delegate. The provider’s delegate calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXAction\/fulfill()] method to indicate that the action was successfully performed.\n\nThe provider sends [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXProviderDelegate\/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt] for successive actions only after the current action is fulfilled. When interacting with the number pad, each entered digit constitutes its own action. Digits following a hard or soft pause, however, are passed to [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXProviderDelegate\/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt] as a single string of digits. For example, if a user taps the 4 button on the number pad, followed by the 2 button, the delegate is sent [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXProviderDelegate\/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt] for the digit `4` and waits for the action to be fulfilled; after the action is fulfilled, the delegate is sent [doc:\/\/com.apple.callkit\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXProviderDelegate\/provider(_:perform:)-4htxt] for the digit `2`.\n\nCallKit automatically plays the corresponding DTMF frequencies for any digits transmitted over a call.
