In future versions of Swift, the string might contain multiple slashes, such as `MyModule\/some\/disambiguation\/MyFile.swift`.\n\nThis macro’s value can be changed by `#sourceLocation`, as described in [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/statements#Line-Control-Statement] in [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/].",
