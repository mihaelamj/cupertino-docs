This initializer “unfolds” your closure into a full-blown asynchronous stream. The created stream handles adherence to the `AsyncSequence` protocol automatically. To terminate the stream with an error, throw the error from your closure.\n\nThe following example shows an `AsyncThrowingStream` created with this initializer that produces random numbers on a one-second interval. If the random number is divisible by 5 with no remainder, the stream throws a `MyRandomNumberError`.",
