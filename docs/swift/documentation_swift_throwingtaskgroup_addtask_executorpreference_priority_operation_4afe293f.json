Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to calling the `addTask` method without a preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/globalConcurrentExecutor] global executor explicitly.\n- **priority**: The priority of the operation task. Omit this parameter or pass `nil` to inherit the task group’s base priority.\n- **operation**: The operation to execute as part of the task group.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method doesn’t throw an error, even if the child task does. Instead, the corresponding call to `ThrowingTaskGroup.next()` rethrows that error.\n\n## Adding Tasks to a Throwing Task Group\n\n- **addTask(priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group.\n- **addTask(name:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group.\n- **addTask(name:executorPreference:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group.\n- **addTaskUnlessCancelled(priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group, unless the group has been canceled. Returns a boolean value indicating if the task was successfully added to the group or not.\n- **addTaskUnlessCancelled(name:executorPreference:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group, unless the group has been canceled. Returns a boolean value indicating if the task was successfully added to the group or not.\n- **addTaskUnlessCancelled(executorPreference:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group, unless the group has been canceled. Returns a boolean value indicating if the task was successfully added to the group or not.\n- **addTaskUnlessCancelled(name:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group, unless the group has been canceled. Returns a boolean value indicating if the task was successfully added to the group or not.\n- **addImmediateTask(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:)**: Add a child task to the group and immediately start running it in the context of the calling thread\/task.\n- **addImmediateTaskUnlessCancelled(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:)**: Add a child task to the group and immediately start running it in the context of the calling thread\/task.\n\n",
