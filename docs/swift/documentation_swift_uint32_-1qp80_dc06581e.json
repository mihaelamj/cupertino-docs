The shift is performed using this masked value.\n\nThe following example defines `x` as an instance of `UInt8`, an 8-bit, unsigned integer type. If you use `2` as the right-hand-side value in an operation on `x`, the shift amount requires no masking.\n\nHowever, if you pass `19` as `rhs`, the method first bitmasks `rhs` to `3`, and then uses that masked value as the number of bits to shift `lhs`.",
