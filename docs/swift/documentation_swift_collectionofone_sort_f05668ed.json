Elements are sorted in ascending order.\n\nHere’s an example of sorting a list of students’ names. Strings in Swift conform to the `Comparable` protocol, so the names are sorted in ascending order according to the less-than operator (`<`).\n\nTo sort the elements of your collection in descending order, pass the greater-than operator (`>`) to the `sort(by:)` method.\n\nThe sorting algorithm is guaranteed to be stable. A stable sort preserves the relative order of elements that compare as equal.",
