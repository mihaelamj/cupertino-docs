  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA dictionary is a type of hash table, providing fast access to the entries it contains. Each entry in the table is identified using its key, which is a hashable type such as a string or number. You use that key to retrieve the corresponding value, which can be any object. In other languages, similar data types are known as hashes or associated arrays.\n\nCreate a new dictionary by using a dictionary literal. A dictionary literal is a comma-separated list of key-value pairs, in which a colon separates each key from its associated value, surrounded by square brackets. You can assign a dictionary literal to a variable or constant or pass it to a function that expects a dictionary.\n\nHere’s how you would create a dictionary of HTTP response codes and their related messages:\n\nThe `responseMessages` variable is inferred to have type `[Int: String]`. The `Key` type of the dictionary is `Int`, and the `Value` type of the dictionary is `String`.\n\nTo create a dictionary with no key-value pairs, use an empty dictionary literal (`[:]`).\n\nAny type that conforms to the `Hashable` protocol can be used as a dictionary’s `Key` type, including all of Swift’s basic types. You can use your own custom types as dictionary keys by making them conform to the `Hashable` protocol.\n\n# Getting and Setting Dictionary Values\n\nThe most common way to access values in a dictionary is to use a key as a subscript. Subscripting with a key takes the following form:\n\nSubscripting a dictionary with a key returns an optional value, because a dictionary might not hold a value for the key that you use in the subscript.\n\nThe next example uses key-based subscripting of the `responseMessages` dictionary with two keys that exist in the dictionary and one that does not.\n\nYou can also update, modify, or remove keys and values from a dictionary using the key-based subscript. To add a new key-value pair, assign a value to a key that isn’t yet a part of the dictionary.\n\nUpdate an existing value by assigning a new value to a key that already exists in the dictionary. If you assign `nil` to an existing key, the key and its associated value are removed. The following example updates the value for the `404` code to be simply “Not found” and removes the key-value pair for the `500` code entirely.\n\nIn a mutable `Dictionary` instance, you can modify in place a value that you’ve accessed through a keyed subscript. The code sample below declares a dictionary called `interestingNumbers` with string keys and values that are integer arrays, then sorts each array in-place in descending order.\n\n# Iterating Over the Contents of a Dictionary\n\nEvery dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. You can iterate over a dictionary using a `for`-`in` loop, decomposing each key-value pair into the elements of a tuple.\n\nThe order of key-value pairs in a dictionary is stable between mutations but is otherwise unpredictable. If you need an ordered collection of key-value pairs and don’t need the fast key lookup that `Dictionary` provides, see the `KeyValuePairs` type for an alternative.\n\nYou can search a dictionary’s contents for a particular value using the `contains(where:)` or `firstIndex(where:)` methods supplied by default implementation. The following example checks to see if `imagePaths` contains any paths in the `\"\/glyphs\"` directory:\n\nNote that in this example, `imagePaths` is subscripted using a dictionary index. Unlike the key-based subscript, the index-based subscript returns the corresponding key-value pair as a non-optional tuple.\n\nA dictionary’s indices stay valid across additions to the dictionary as long as the dictionary has enough capacity to store the added values without allocating more buffer. When a dictionary outgrows its buffer, existing indices may be invalidated without any notification.\n\nWhen you know how many new values you’re adding to a dictionary, use the `init(minimumCapacity:)` initializer to allocate the correct amount of buffer.\n\n# Bridging Between Dictionary and NSDictionary\n\nYou can bridge between `Dictionary` and `NSDictionary` using the `as` operator. For bridging to be possible, the `Key` and `Value` types of a dictionary must be classes, `@objc` protocols, or types that bridge to Foundation types.\n\nBridging from `Dictionary` to `NSDictionary` always takes O(1) time and space. When the dictionary’s `Key` and `Value` types are neither classes nor `@objc` protocols, any required bridging of elements occurs at the first access of each element. For this reason, the first operation that uses the contents of the dictionary may take O(*n*).\n\nBridging from `NSDictionary` to `Dictionary` first calls the `copy(with:)` method (`- copyWithZone:` in Objective-C) on the dictionary to get an immutable copy and then performs additional Swift bookkeeping work that takes O(1) time. For instances of `NSDictionary` that are already immutable, `copy(with:)` usually returns the same dictionary in O(1) time; otherwise, the copying performance is unspecified. The instances of `NSDictionary` and `Dictionary` share buffer using the same copy-on-write optimization that is used when two instances of `Dictionary` share buffer.",

To add a new key-value pair, assign a value to a key that isn’t yet a part of the dictionary.\n\n```swift\nresponseMessages[301] = \"Moved permanently\"\nprint(responseMessages[301])\n\/\/ Prints \"Optional(\"Moved permanently\")\"\n```\n\nUpdate an existing value by assigning a new value to a key that already exists in the dictionary.

The following example updates the value for the `404` code to be simply “Not found” and removes the key-value pair for the `500` code entirely.\n\n```swift\nresponseMessages[404] = \"Not found\"\nresponseMessages[500] = nil\nprint(responseMessages)\n\/\/ Prints \"[301: \"Moved permanently\", 200: \"OK\", 403: \"Access forbidden\", 404: \"Not found\"]\"\n```\n\nIn a mutable `Dictionary` instance, you can modify in place a value that you’ve accessed through a keyed subscript.
