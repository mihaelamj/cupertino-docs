This initializer “unfolds” your closure into an asynchronous stream. The created stream handles conformance to the `AsyncSequence` protocol automatically, including termination (either by cancellation or by returning `nil` from the closure to finish iteration).\n\nThe following example shows an `AsyncStream` created with this initializer that produces random numbers on a one-second interval. This example uses the Swift multiple trailing closure syntax, which omits the `unfolding` parameter label.",
