If the memory is bound to a type `U` that is layout compatible with `T`, then it contains a value of type `U`. Calling `storeBytes(of:toByteOffset:as:)` does not change the bound type of the memory.\n\nIf you need to store into memory a copy of a value of a type that isn’t trivial, you cannot use the `storeBytes(of:toByteOffset:as:)` method.
