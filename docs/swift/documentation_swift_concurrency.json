When a generic type `T` conforms to `SendableMetatype`, its metatype `T.Type` conforms to `Sendable`.  All concrete types implicitly conform to the `SendableMetatype` protocol, so its primary purpose is in generic code to prohibit the use of isolated conformances along with the generic type.\n- **ConcurrentValue**\n- **UnsafeSendable**: A type whose values can safely be passed across concurrency domains by copying, but which disables some safety checking at the conformance site.\n- **UnsafeConcurrentValue**\n- **isolation()**: Produce a reference to the actor to which the enclosing code is isolated, or `nil` if the code is nonisolated.\n- **extractIsolation(_:)**\n\n## Task-Local Storage\n\n- **TaskLocal**: Wrapper type that defines a task-local value key.\n- **TaskLocal()**: Macro that introduces a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/TaskLocal] binding.\n\n## Executors\n\n- **Executor**: A service that can execute jobs.\n- **ExecutorJob**: A unit of schedulable work.\n- **SerialExecutor**: A service that executes jobs.\n- **TaskExecutor**: An executor that may be used as preferred executor by a task.\n- **PartialAsyncTask**\n- **UnownedJob**: A unit of schedulable work.\n- **JobPriority**: The priority of this job.\n- **UnownedSerialExecutor**: An unowned reference to a serial executor (a `SerialExecutor` value).\n- **UnownedTaskExecutor**\n- **globalConcurrentExecutor**: The global concurrent executor that is used by default for Swift Concurrency tasks.\n- **withTaskExecutorPreference(_:isolation:operation:)**: Configure the current task hierarchy’s task executor preference to the passed [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/TaskExecutor], and execute the passed in closure by immediately hopping to that executor.\n\n## Deprecated\n\n- **Job**: Deprecated equivalent of [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/ExecutorJob].\n\n## Programming Tasks\n\n- **Input and Output**: Print values to the console, read from and write to text streams, and use command line arguments.\n- **Debugging and Reflection**: Fortify your code with runtime checks, and examine your values’ runtime representation.\n- **Macros**: Generate boilerplate code and perform other compile-time operations.\n- **Key-Path Expressions**: Use key-path expressions to access properties dynamically.\n- **Manual Memory Management**: Allocate and manage memory manually.\n- **Type Casting and Existential Types**: Perform casts between types or represent values of any type.\n- **C Interoperability**: Use imported C types or call C variadic functions.\n- **Operator Declarations**: Work with prefix, postfix, and infix operators.\n\n",
