(Symmetry)\n- If `areEquivalent(a, b)` and `areEquivalent(b, c)` are both `true`, then `areEquivalent(a, c)` is also `true`. (Transitivity)\n\n\n\n## Comparing Characters\n\n- **elementsEqual(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.\n- **starts(with:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements in another sequence.\n- **starts(with:by:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.\n- **lexicographicallyPrecedes(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the less-than operator (`<`) to compare elements.\n- **lexicographicallyPrecedes(_:by:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.\n\n",
