If the sequence has no elements, the result is `initialResult`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse the `reduce(_:_:)` method to produce a single value from the elements of an entire sequence. For example, you can use this method on an array of numbers to find their sum or product.\n\nThe `nextPartialResult` closure is called sequentially with an accumulating value initialized to `initialResult` and each element of the sequence. This example shows how to find the sum of an array of numbers.\n\n```swift\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlet numberSum = numbers.reduce(0, { x, y in\n    x + y\n})\n\/\/ numberSum == 10\n```\n\nWhen `numbers.reduce(_:_:)` is called, the following steps occur:\n\n1. The `nextPartialResult` closure is called with `initialResult`—`0` in this case—and the first element of `numbers`, returning the sum: `1`.\n2. The closure is called again repeatedly with the previous call’s return value and each element of the sequence.\n3. When the sequence is exhausted, the last value returned from the closure is returned to the caller.\n\nIf the sequence has no elements, `nextPartialResult` is never executed and `initialResult` is the result of the call to `reduce(_:_:)`.\n\n\n\n",
