For most numbers `x`, this is the difference between `x` and the next greater (in magnitude) representable number. There are some edge cases to be aware of:\n\n- If `x` is not a finite number, then `x.ulp` is NaN.\n- If `x` is very small in magnitude, then `x.ulp` may be a subnormal number. If a type does not support subnormals, `x.ulp` may be rounded to zero.\n- `greatestFiniteMagnitude.ulp` is a finite number, even though the next greater representable value is `infinity`.\n\nSee also the `ulpOfOne` static property.\n\n## Querying a Float\n\n- **significand**: The significand of the floating-point value.\n- **exponent**: The exponent of the floating-point value.\n- **nextUp**: The least representable value that compares greater than this value.\n- **nextDown**: The greatest representable value that compares less than this value.\n- **binade**: The floating-point value with the same sign and exponent as this value, but with a significand of 1.0.\n\n",
