  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo create a discarding task group, call the `withDiscardingTaskGroup(returning:body:)` method.\n\nDon’t use a task group from outside the task where you created it. In most cases, the Swift type system prevents a task group from escaping like that because adding a child task to a task group is a mutating operation, and mutation operations can’t be performed from a concurrent execution context like a child task.\n\nRefer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/TaskGroup] documentation for detailed discussion of semantics shared between all task groups.\n\n### Discarding behavior\n\nA discarding task group eagerly discards and releases its child tasks as soon as they complete. This allows for the efficient releasing of memory used by those tasks, which are not retained for future `next()` calls, as would be the case with a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/TaskGroup].\n\n### Cancellation behavior\n\nA throwing discarding task group becomes canceled in one of the following ways:\n\nBut also, and uniquely in *discarding* task groups:\n\nThe group becoming canceled automatically, and cancelling all of its child tasks, whenever *any* child task throws an error is a behavior unique to discarding task groups, because achieving such semantics is not possible otherwise, due to the missing `next()` method on discarding groups. Accumulating task groups can implement this by manually polling `next()` and deciding to `cancelAll()` when they decide an error should cause the group to become canceled, however a discarding group cannot poll child tasks for results and therefore assumes that child task throws are an indication of a group wide failure. In order to avoid such behavior, use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/DiscardingTaskGroup] instead of a throwing one, or catch specific errors in operations submitted using `addTask`.\n\nSince a `ThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup` is a structured concurrency primitive, cancellation is automatically propagated through all of its child-tasks (and their child tasks).\n\nA canceled task group can still keep adding tasks, however they will start being immediately canceled, and may act accordingly to this. To avoid adding new tasks to an already canceled task group, use `addTaskUnlessCancelled(priority:body:)` rather than the plain `addTask(priority:body:)` which adds tasks unconditionally.\n\nFor information about the language-level concurrency model that `DiscardingTaskGroup` is part of, see [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/LanguageGuide\/Concurrency.html] in [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/].",
