The sequence ends either when the base sequence ends or when `transform` throws an error.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse the `compactMap(_:)` method to transform every element received from a base asynchronous sequence, while also discarding any `nil` results from the closure. Typically, you use this to transform from one type of element to another.\n\nIn this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `5`. The closure provided to the `compactMap(_:)` method takes each `Int` and looks up a corresponding `String` from a `romanNumeralDict` dictionary. Since there is no key for `4`, the closure returns `nil` in this case, which `compactMap(_:)` omits from the transformed asynchronous sequence. When the value is `5`, the closure throws `MyError`, terminating the sequence.",
