For example, a rendering engine might display “fl” in English as a connected glyph; inserting the zero width non-joiner would force them to be rendered as disconnected glyphs.\n- When U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER is inserted between two characters, it directs the rendering engine to render them as a connected glyph when it would otherwise render them independently. The zero width joiner is also used to construct complex emoji from sequences of base emoji characters. For example, the various “family” emoji are encoded as sequences of man, woman, or child emoji that are interleaved with zero width joiners.\n\nThis property corresponds to the “Join_Control” property in the [http:\/\/www.unicode.org\/versions\/latest\/].\n\n",
