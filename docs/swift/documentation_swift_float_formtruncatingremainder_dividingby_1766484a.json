The `formTruncatingRemainder(dividingBy:)` method is always exact.\n\n## Performing Calculations\n\n- **Floating-Point Operators for Float**: Perform arithmetic and bitwise operations or compare values.\n- **addingProduct(_:_:)**: Returns the result of adding the product of the two given values to this value, computed without intermediate rounding.\n- **addProduct(_:_:)**: Adds the product of the two given values to this value in place, computed without intermediate rounding.\n- **squareRoot()**: Returns the square root of the value, rounded to a representable value.\n- **formSquareRoot()**: Replaces this value with its square root, rounded to a representable value.\n- **remainder(dividingBy:)**: Returns the remainder of this value divided by the given value.\n- **formRemainder(dividingBy:)**: Replaces this value with the remainder of itself divided by the given value.\n- **truncatingRemainder(dividingBy:)**: Returns the remainder of this value divided by the given value using truncating division.\n- **negate()**: Replaces this value with its additive inverse.\n\n",
