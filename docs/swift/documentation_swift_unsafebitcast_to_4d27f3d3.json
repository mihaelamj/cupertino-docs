Common conversions supported by the Swift standard library include the following:\n\n- Value conversion from one integer type to another. Use the destination type’s initializer or the `numericCast(_:)` function.\n- Bitwise conversion from one integer type to another. Use the destination type’s `init(truncatingIfNeeded:)` or `init(bitPattern:)` initializer.\n- Conversion from a pointer to an integer value with the bit pattern of the pointer’s address in memory, or vice versa. Use the `init(bitPattern:)` initializer for the destination type.\n- Casting an instance of a reference type. Use the casting operators (`as`, `as!`, or `as?`) or the `unsafeDowncast(_:to:)` function. Do not use `unsafeBitCast(_:to:)` with class or pointer types; doing so may introduce undefined behavior.\n\nWarning: Calling this function breaks the guarantees of the Swift type system; use with extreme care.\n\nWarning: Casting from an integer or a pointer type to a reference type is undefined behavior. It may result in incorrect code in any future compiler release. To convert a bit pattern to a reference type:\n\n1. convert the bit pattern to an UnsafeRawPointer.\n2. create an unmanaged reference using Unmanaged.fromOpaque()\n3. obtain a managed reference using Unmanaged.takeUnretainedValue() The programmer must ensure that the resulting reference has already been manually retained.\n\nParameters:\n\n- x: The instance to cast to `type`.\n- type: The type to cast `x` to. `type` and the type of `x` must have the same size of memory representation and compatible memory layout. Returns: A new instance of type `U`, cast from `x`.\n\n## Instance Casting\n\n- **unsafeDowncast(_:to:)**: Returns the given instance cast unconditionally to the specified type.\n\n",
