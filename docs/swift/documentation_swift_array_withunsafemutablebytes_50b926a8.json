If no such storage exists, it is created. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withUnsafeMutableBytes(_:)` method. The argument is valid only for the duration of the closure’s execution.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe array’s `Element` type must be a *trivial type*, which can be copied with just a bit-for-bit copy without any indirection or reference-counting operations. Generally, native Swift types that do not contain strong or weak references are trivial, as are imported C structs and enums.\n\nThe following example copies bytes from the `byteValues` array into `numbers`, an array of `Int32`:\n\n```swift\nvar numbers: [Int32] = [0, 0]\nvar byteValues: [UInt8] = [0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]\n\nnumbers.withUnsafeMutableBytes { destBytes in\n    byteValues.withUnsafeBytes { srcBytes in\n        destBytes.copyBytes(from: srcBytes)\n    }\n}\n\/\/ numbers == [1, 2]\n```\n\n\n\nThe pointer passed as an argument to `body` is valid only for the lifetime of the closure.
