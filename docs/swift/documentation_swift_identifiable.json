For example, you could define a `User` type with an `id` property that is stable across your app and your app’s database storage. You could use the `id` property to identify a particular user even if other data fields change, such as the user’s name.\n\n`Identifiable` leaves the duration and scope of the identity unspecified. Identities can have any of the following characteristics:\n\nIt’s up to both the conformer and the receiver of the protocol to document the nature of the identity.\n\n# Conforming to the Identifiable Protocol\n\n`Identifiable` provides a default implementation for class types (using `ObjectIdentifier`), which is only guaranteed to remain unique for the lifetime of an object. If an object has a stronger notion of identity, it may be appropriate to provide a custom implementation.",

Identities can have any of the following characteristics:\n\n- Guaranteed always unique, like UUIDs.\n- Persistently unique per environment, like database record keys.\n- Unique for the lifetime of a process, like global incrementing integers.\n- Unique for the lifetime of an object, like object identifiers.\n- Unique within the current collection, like collection indices.\n\nIt’s up to both the conformer and the receiver of the protocol to document the nature of the identity.\n\n# Conforming to the Identifiable Protocol\n\n`Identifiable` provides a default implementation for class types (using `ObjectIdentifier`), which is only guaranteed to remain unique for the lifetime of an object.
