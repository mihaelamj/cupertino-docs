That is, for any elements `a`, `b`, and `c`, the following conditions must hold:\n\n- `areInIncreasingOrder(a, a)` is always `false`. (Irreflexivity)\n- If `areInIncreasingOrder(a, b)` and `areInIncreasingOrder(b, c)` are both `true`, then `areInIncreasingOrder(a, c)` is also `true`. (Transitive comparability)\n- Two elements are *incomparable* if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If `a` and `b` are incomparable, and `b` and `c` are incomparable, then `a` and `c` are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)\n\n\n\n\n\n",
