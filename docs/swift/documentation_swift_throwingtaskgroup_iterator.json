If a task completes by throwing an error, it doesn’t return any further task results. After iterating over the results of each task, it’s valid to make a new iterator for the task group, which you can use to iterate over the results of new tasks you add to the group. You can also make a new iterator to resume iteration after a child task throws an error. For example:",
