The collection traversal modeled by `unlabeledChildren` is captured so that the resulting mirror’s children may be upgraded to a bidirectional or random access collection later. See the `children` property for details.\n- **displayStyle**: The preferred display style for the mirror when presented in the debugger or in a playground. The default is `nil`.\n- **ancestorRepresentation**: The means of generating the subject’s ancestor representation. `ancestorRepresentation` is ignored if `subject` is not a class instance. The default is `.generated`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou use this initializer from within your type’s `customMirror` implementation to create a customized mirror, particularly for custom types that are collections. The labels of the resulting mirror’s `children` collection are all `nil`.\n\nIf `subject` is a class instance, `ancestorRepresentation` determines whether ancestor classes will be represented and whether their `customMirror` implementations will be used.
