If `maxSplits + 1` subsequences are returned, the last one is a suffix of the original collection containing the remaining elements. `maxSplits` must be greater than or equal to zero. The default value is `Int.max`.\n- **omittingEmptySubsequences**: If `false`, an empty subsequence is returned in the result for each pair of consecutive elements satisfying the `isSeparator` predicate and for each element at the start or end of the collection satisfying the `isSeparator` predicate. The default value is `true`.\n- **isSeparator**: A closure that takes an element as an argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the collection should be split at that element.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn array of subsequences, split from this collection’s elements.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe resulting array consists of at most `maxSplits + 1` subsequences. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.\n\nThe following examples show the effects of the `maxSplits` and `omittingEmptySubsequences` parameters when splitting a string using a closure that matches spaces.
