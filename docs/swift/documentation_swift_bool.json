If either of the values is `false`, the operator returns `false`.\n\nThis operator uses short-circuit evaluation: The left-hand side (`lhs`) is evaluated first, and the right-hand side (`rhs`) is evaluated only if `lhs` evaluates to `true`. For example:\n\nIn this example, `lhs` tests whether `measurements.count` is greater than zero. Evaluation of the `&&` operator is one of the following:",

If either of the values is `false`, the operator returns `false`.\n\nThis operator uses short-circuit evaluation: The left-hand side (`lhs`) is evaluated first, and the right-hand side (`rhs`) is evaluated only if `lhs` evaluates to `true`. For example:\n\n```swift\nlet measurements = [7.44, 6.51, 4.74, 5.88, 6.27, 6.12, 7.76]\nlet sum = measurements.reduce(0, +)\n\nif measurements.count > 0 && sum \/ Double(measurements.count) < 6.5 {\n    print(\"Average measurement is less than 6.5\")\n}\n\/\/ Prints \"Average measurement is less than 6.5\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `lhs` tests whether `measurements.count` is greater than zero. Evaluation of the `&&` operator is one of the following:\n\n- When `measurements.count` is equal to zero, `lhs` evaluates to `false` and `rhs` is not evaluated, preventing a divide-by-zero error in the expression `sum \/ Double(measurements.count)`. The result of the operation is `false`.\n- When `measurements.count` is greater than zero, `lhs` evaluates to `true` and `rhs` is evaluated. The result of evaluating `rhs` is the result of the `&&` operation.\n\n## Transforming a Boolean\n\n- **toggle()**: Toggles the Boolean variable’s value.\n- **!(_:)**: Performs a logical NOT operation on a Boolean value.\n- **||(_:_:)**: Performs a logical OR operation on two Boolean values.\n\n",
