In particular, an asynchronous stream is well-suited to adapt callback- or delegation-based APIs to participate with `async`-`await`.\n\nYou initialize an `AsyncStream` with a closure that receives an `AsyncStream.Continuation`.

To receive callbacks, callers set a custom closure as the value of the monitor’s `quakeHandler` property, which the monitor calls back as necessary.\n\n```swift\nclass QuakeMonitor {\n    var quakeHandler: ((Quake) -> Void)?\n\n    func startMonitoring() {…}\n    func stopMonitoring() {…}\n}\n```\n\nTo adapt this to use `async`-`await`, extend the `QuakeMonitor` to add a `quakes` property, of type `AsyncStream<Quake>`. In the getter for this property, return an `AsyncStream`, whose `build` closure – called at runtime to create the stream – uses the continuation to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Creates a `QuakeMonitor` instance.\n2. Sets the monitor’s `quakeHandler` property to a closure that receives each `Quake` instance and forwards it to the stream by calling the continuation’s `yield(_:)` method.\n3. Sets the continuation’s `onTermination` property to a closure that calls `stopMonitoring()` on the monitor.\n4. Calls `startMonitoring` on the `QuakeMonitor`.\n\n```swift\nextension QuakeMonitor {\n\n    static var quakes: AsyncStream<Quake> {\n        AsyncStream { continuation in\n            let monitor = QuakeMonitor()\n            monitor.quakeHandler = { quake in\n                continuation.yield(quake)\n            }\n            continuation.onTermination = { @Sendable _ in\n                 monitor.stopMonitoring()\n            }\n            monitor.startMonitoring()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBecause the stream is an `AsyncSequence`, the call point can use the `for`-`await`-`in` syntax to process each `Quake` instance as the stream produces it:\n\n```swift\nfor await quake in QuakeMonitor.quakes {\n    print(\"Quake: \\(quake.date)\")\n}\nprint(\"Stream
