For example, it would be reasonable to implement alternative operations in which operating on a signaling NaN triggers a runtime error or results in a diagnostic for debugging purposes. Types that implement alternative behaviors for a signaling NaN must document the departure.\n\nOther than these signaling operations, a signaling NaN behaves in the same manner as a quiet NaN.",
