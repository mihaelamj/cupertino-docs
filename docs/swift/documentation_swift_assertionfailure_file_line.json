The default is an empty string.\n- **file**: The file name to print with `message`. The default is the file where `assertionFailure(_:file:line:)` is called.\n- **line**: The line number to print along with `message`. The default is the line number where `assertionFailure(_:file:line:)` is called.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function’s effect varies depending on the build flag used:\n\n- In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration), stop program execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.\n- In `-O` builds, has no effect.\n- In `-Ounchecked` builds, the optimizer may assume that this function is never called. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious programming error.\n\n## Testing\n\n- **assert(_:_:file:line:)**: Performs a traditional C-style assert with an optional message.\n- **precondition(_:_:file:line:)**: Checks a necessary condition for making forward progress.\n- **preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)**: Indicates that a precondition was violated.\n\n",
