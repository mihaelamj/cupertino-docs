If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withCString(encodedAs:_:)` method. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the method’s execution.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe pointer passed as an argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withCString(encodedAs:_:)`.
