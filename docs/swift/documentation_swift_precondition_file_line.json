The default is an empty string.\n- **file**: The file name to print with `message` if the precondition fails. The default is the file where `precondition(_:_:file:line:)` is called.\n- **line**: The line number to print along with `message` if the assertion fails. The default is the line number where `precondition(_:_:file:line:)` is called.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this function to detect conditions that must prevent the program from proceeding, even in shipping code.\n\n- In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration): If `condition` evaluates to `false`, stop program execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.\n- In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode’s Release configuration): If `condition` evaluates to `false`, stop program execution.\n- In `-Ounchecked` builds, `condition` is not evaluated, but the optimizer may assume that it *always* evaluates to `true`. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious programming error.\n\n## Testing\n\n- **assert(_:_:file:line:)**: Performs a traditional C-style assert with an optional message.\n- **assertionFailure(_:file:line:)**: Indicates that an internal consistency check failed.\n- **preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)**: Indicates that a precondition was violated.\n\n",
