If `areInIncreasingOrder` throws an error during the sort, the elements may be in a different order, but none will be lost.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen you want to sort a collection of elements that don’t conform to the `Comparable` protocol, pass a closure to this method that returns `true` when the first element should be ordered before the second.\n\nIn the following example, the closure provides an ordering for an array of a custom enumeration that describes an HTTP response. The predicate orders errors before successes and sorts the error responses by their error code.\n\n```swift\nenum HTTPResponse {\n    case ok\n    case error(Int)\n}\n\nvar responses: [HTTPResponse] = [.error(500), .ok, .ok, .error(404), .error(403)]\nresponses.sort {\n    switch ($0, $1) {\n    \/\/ Order errors by code\n    case let (.error(aCode), .error(bCode)):\n        return aCode < bCode\n\n    \/\/ All successes are equivalent, so none is before any other\n    case (.ok, .ok): return false\n\n    \/\/ Order errors before successes\n    case (.error, .ok): return true\n    case (.ok, .error): return false\n    }\n}\nprint(responses)\n\/\/ Prints \"[.error(403), .error(404), .error(500), .ok, .ok]\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, use this method to sort a collection of elements that do conform to `Comparable` when you want the sort to be descending instead of ascending.

That is, for any elements `a`, `b`, and `c`, the following conditions must hold:\n\n- `areInIncreasingOrder(a, a)` is always `false`. (Irreflexivity)\n- If `areInIncreasingOrder(a, b)` and `areInIncreasingOrder(b, c)` are both `true`, then `areInIncreasingOrder(a, c)` is also `true`. (Transitive comparability)\n- Two elements are *incomparable* if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If `a` and `b` are incomparable, and `b` and `c` are incomparable, then `a` and `c` are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)\n\nThe sorting algorithm is guaranteed to be stable. A stable sort preserves the relative order of elements for which `areInIncreasingOrder` does not establish an order.\n\n\n\n",
