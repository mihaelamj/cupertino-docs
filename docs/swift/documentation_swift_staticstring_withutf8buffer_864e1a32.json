If the closure has a return value, that value is also used as the return value of the `withUTF8Buffer(_:)` method. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the method’s execution.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method works regardless of whether the static string stores a pointer or a single Unicode scalar value.\n\nThe pointer argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withUTF8Buffer(_:)`.
