Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to no preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/globalConcurrentExecutor] global executor explicitly.\n- **priority**: The priority of the operation task.\n- **operation**: The operation to perform.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA reference to the task.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou need to keep a reference to the task if you want to cancel it by calling the `Task.cancel()` method. Discarding your reference to a task doesn’t implicitly cancel that task, it only makes it impossible for you to explicitly cancel the task.\n\n## Creating a Task\n\n- **init(name:priority:operation:)**: Runs the given nonthrowing operation asynchronously as part of a new *unstructured* top-level task.\n- **init(name:priority:operation:)**: Runs the given throwing operation asynchronously as part of a new *unstructured* top-level task.\n- **init(name:executorPreference:priority:operation:)**: Runs the given throwing operation asynchronously as part of a new *unstructured* top-level task.\n- **currentPriority**: The current task’s priority.\n- **basePriority**: The current task’s base priority.\n- **withTaskPriorityEscalationHandler(operation:onPriorityEscalated:isolation:)**: Runs the passed `operation` while registering a task priority escalation handler. The handler will be triggered concurrently to the current task if the current is subject to priority escalation.\n\n",
