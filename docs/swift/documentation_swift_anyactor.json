When a generic type `T` conforms to `SendableMetatype`, its metatype `T.Type` conforms to `Sendable`.  All concrete types implicitly conform to the `SendableMetatype` protocol, so its primary purpose is in generic code to prohibit the use of isolated conformances along with the generic type.\n- **ConcurrentValue**\n- **UnsafeSendable**: A type whose values can safely be passed across concurrency domains by copying, but which disables some safety checking at the conformance site.\n- **UnsafeConcurrentValue**\n- **isolation()**: Produce a reference to the actor to which the enclosing code is isolated, or `nil` if the code is nonisolated.\n- **extractIsolation(_:)**\n\n",
