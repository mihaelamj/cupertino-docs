  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe magnitude of a floating-point value `x` of type `F` can be calculated by using the following formula, where `**` is exponentiation:\n\nIn the next example, `y` has a value of `21.5`, which is encoded as `1.34375 * 2 ** 4`. The significand of `y` is therefore 1.34375.\n\nIf a type’s radix is 2, then for finite nonzero numbers, the significand is in the range `1.0 ..< 2.0`. For other values of `x`, `x.significand` is defined as follows:",
