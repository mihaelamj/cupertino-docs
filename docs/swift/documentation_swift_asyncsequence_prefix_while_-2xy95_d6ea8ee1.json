The modified sequence ends when the predicate closure returns `false`.\n\nIn this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `10`. The `prefix(while:)` method causes the modified sequence to pass along values so long as they aren’t divisible by `2` and `3`. Upon reaching `6`, the sequence ends:",
