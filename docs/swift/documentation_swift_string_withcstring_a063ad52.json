If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withCString(_:)` method. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the method’s execution.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe pointer passed as an argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withCString(_:)`. Do not store or return the pointer for later use.\n\n## Getting C Strings\n\n- **utf8CString**: A contiguously stored null-terminated UTF-8 representation of the string.\n- **withCString(encodedAs:_:)**: Calls the given closure with a pointer to the contents of the string, represented as a null-terminated sequence of code units.\n\n",
