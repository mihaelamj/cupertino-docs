The default is a single space (`\" \"`).\n- **terminator**: The string to print after all items have been printed. The default is a newline (`\"\\n\"`).\n- **output**: An output stream to receive the text representation of each item.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou can pass zero or more items to the `debugPrint(_:separator:terminator:to:)` function. The textual representation for each item is the same as that obtained by calling `String(reflecting: item)`. The following example prints a closed range of integers to a string:\n\n```swift\nvar range = \"My range: \"\ndebugPrint(1...5, to: &range)\n\/\/ range == \"My range: ClosedRange(1...5)\\n\"\n```\n\nTo print the items separated by something other than a space, pass a string as `separator`.\n\n```swift\nvar separated = \"\"\ndebugPrint(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, separator: \" ... \", to: &separated)\n\/\/ separated == \"1.0 ... 2.0 ... 3.0 ... 4.0 ... 5.0\\n\"\n```\n\nThe output from each call to `debugPrint(_:separator:terminator:to:)` includes a newline by default. To print the items without a trailing newline, pass an empty string as `terminator`.\n\n```swift\nvar numbers = \"\"\nfor n in 1...5 {\n    debugPrint(n, terminator: \"\", to: &numbers)\n}\n\/\/ numbers == \"12345\"\n```\n\n## Printing and Dumping\n\n- **print(_:separator:terminator:)**: Writes the textual representations of the given items into the standard output.\n- **print(_:separator:terminator:to:)**: Writes the textual representations of the given items into the given output stream.\n- **debugPrint(_:separator:terminator:)**: Writes the textual representations of the given items most suitable for debugging into the standard output.\n- **dump(_:name:indent:maxDepth:maxItems:)**: Dumps the given object’s contents using its mirror to standard output.\n- **dump(_:to:name:indent:maxDepth:maxItems:)**: Dumps the given object’s contents using its mirror to the specified output stream.\n\n",
