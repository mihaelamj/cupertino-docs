  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nAn asynchronous sequence that skips over values until the provided closure returns `false` or throws an error.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse `drop(while:)` to omit elements from an asynchronous sequence until the element received meets a condition you specify. If the closure you provide throws an error, the sequence produces no elements and throws the error instead.\n\nIn this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `10`. The predicate passed to the `drop(while:)` method throws an error if it encounters an even number, and otherwise returns `true` while it receives elements less than `5`. Because the predicate throws when it receives `2` from the base sequence, this example throws without ever printing anything.\n\nAfter the predicate returns `false`, the sequence never executes it again, and from then on the sequence passes through elements from its underlying sequence. A predicate that throws an error also never executes again.",
