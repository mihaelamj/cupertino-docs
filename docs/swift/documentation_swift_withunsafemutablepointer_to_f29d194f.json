Note that the `inout` exclusivity rules mean that, like any other `inout` argument, `value` cannot be directly accessed by other code for the duration of `body`. Access must only occur through the pointer argument to `body` until `body` returns.\n- **body**: A closure that takes a mutable pointer to `value` as its sole argument. If the closure has a return value, that value is also used as the return value of the `withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)` function. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the function’s execution.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe `withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)` function is useful for calling Objective-C APIs that take in\/out parameters (and default-constructible out parameters) by pointer.\n\nThe pointer argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)`. Do not store or return the pointer for later use.\n\n## Pointers to Values\n\n- **withUnsafePointer(to:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.\n- **withUnsafePointer(to:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeBytes(of:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeBytes(of:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeMutableBytes(of:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a mutable buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.\n\n",
