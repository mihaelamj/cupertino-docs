  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe `<<` operator performs a *smart shift*, which defines a result for a shift of any value.\n\nThe following example defines `x` as an instance of `UInt8`, an 8-bit, unsigned integer type. If you use `2` as the right-hand-side value in an operation on `x`, the value is shifted left by two bits.\n\nIf you use `11` as `rhs`, `x` is overshifted such that all of its bits are set to zero.\n\nUsing a negative value as `rhs` is the same as performing a right shift with `abs(rhs)`.",
