Child tasks inherit the parent task’s priority and task-local storage, and canceling a parent task automatically cancels all of its child tasks. You need to handle these considerations manually with a detached task.\n\nYou need to keep a reference to the task if you want to cancel it by calling the `Task.cancel()` method. Discarding your reference to a task doesn’t implicitly cancel that task, it only makes it impossible for you to explicitly cancel the task.",

Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to no preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/globalConcurrentExecutor] global executor explicitly.\n- **priority**: The priority of the operation task. Omit this parameter or pass `nil` to inherit the enclosing context’s base priority.\n- **operation**: The operation to perform.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA reference to the task.\n\n## Discussion\n\nDon’t use a detached unstructured task if it’s possible to model the operation using structured concurrency features like child tasks. Child tasks inherit the parent task’s priority and task-local storage, and canceling a parent task automatically cancels all of its child tasks.
