The `nextPartialResult` closure receives `initialResult` the first time the closure executes.\n- **updateAccumulatingResult**: A closure that combines an accumulating value and an element of the asynchronous sequence into a new accumulating value, for use in the next call of the `nextPartialResult` closure or returned to the caller.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe final accumulated value. If the sequence has no elements, the result is `initialResult`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse the `reduce(into:_:)` method to produce a single value from the elements of an entire sequence. For example, you can use this method on a sequence of numbers to find their sum or product.\n\nThe `updateAccumulatingResult` closure executes sequentially with an accumulating value initialized to `initialResult` and each element of the sequence.\n\nPrefer this method over `reduce(_:_:)` for efficiency when the result is a copy-on-write type, for example an `Array` or `Dictionary`.\n\n## Accessing an Asynchronous Sequence of Results\n\n- **makeAsyncIterator()**: Creates the asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.\n- **allSatisfy(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.\n- **compactMap(_:)**: Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.\n- **compactMap(_:)**: Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.\n- **contains(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains the given element.\n- **contains(where:)**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.\n- **drop(while:)**: Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.\n- **dropFirst(_:)**: Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.\n- **filter(_:)**: Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.\n- **first(where:)**: Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.\n- **map(_:)**: Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.\n- **map(_:)**: Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.\n- **max()**: Returns the maximum element in an asynchronous sequence of comparable elements.\n- **max(by:)**: Returns the maximum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.\n- **min()**: Returns the minimum element in an asynchronous sequence of comparable elements.\n\n",
