The memory must also be uninitialized, initialized to `T`, or initialized to another trivial type that is layout compatible with `T`.\n\nThe memory written to must not extend beyond the memory region represented by the buffer pointer slice—that is, `offset + MemoryLayout<T>.size` must be less than or equal to the slice’s `count`.\n\nAfter calling `storeBytes(of:toByteOffset:as:)`, the memory is initialized to the raw bytes of `value`. If the memory is bound to a type `U` that is layout compatible with `T`, then it contains a value of type `U`. Calling `storeBytes(of:toByteOffset:as:)` does not change the bound type of the memory.\n\nIf you need to store into memory a copy of a value of a type that isn’t trivial, you cannot use the `storeBytes(of:toByteOffset:as:)` method. Instead, you must know either initialize the memory or, if you know the memory was already bound to `type`, assign to the memory.",
