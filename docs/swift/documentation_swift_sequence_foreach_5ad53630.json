You cannot use a `break` or `continue` statement to exit the current call of the `body` closure or skip subsequent calls.\n2. Using the `return` statement in the `body` closure will exit only from the current call to `body`, not from any outer scope, and won’t skip subsequent calls.\n\n## Iterating Over a Sequence’s Elements\n\n- **enumerated()**: Returns a sequence of pairs (*n*, *x*), where *n* represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and *x* represents an element of the sequence.\n- **underestimatedCount**: A value less than or equal to the number of elements in the sequence, calculated nondestructively.\n\n",
