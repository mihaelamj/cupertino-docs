For example, you can use this method on an sequence of numbers to find their sum or product.\n\nThe `nextPartialResult` closure executes sequentially with an accumulating value initialized to `initialResult` and each element of the sequence.\n\nIn this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `4`.
