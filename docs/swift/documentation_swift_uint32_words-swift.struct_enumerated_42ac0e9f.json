  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA sequence of pairs enumerating the sequence.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis example enumerates the characters of the string “Swift” and prints each character along with its place in the string.\n\nWhen you enumerate a collection, the integer part of each pair is a counter for the enumeration, but is not necessarily the index of the paired value. These counters can be used as indices only in instances of zero-based, integer-indexed collections, such as `Array` and `ContiguousArray`. For other collections the counters may be out of range or of the wrong type to use as an index. To iterate over the elements of a collection with its indices, use the `zip(_:_:)` function.\n\nThis example iterates over the indices and elements of a set, building a list consisting of indices of names with five or fewer letters.\n\nNow that the `shorterIndices` array holds the indices of the shorter names in the `names` set, you can use those indices to access elements in the set.",
