  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf you want to import an Objective-C API into Swift with a different name, use the `NS_SWIFT_NAME` macro. The macro preserves the Objective-C name for use with Objective-C code, so the API has appropriate names in each language.\n\nYou apply the `NS_SWIFT_NAME` macro to an individual type, method, or function declaration in Objective-C. After applying the macro, the name you use in your Swift code will be what you’ve chosen by using the macro.\n\n### Rename APIs\n\nThe example below renames a class and one of its properties:\n\nThe `SandwichPreferences` class and its `includesCrust` property are renamed to `Sandwich.Preferences` and `isCrusty` for Swift:\n\nYou use the `NS_SWIFT_NAME` macro as a prefix for classes and protocols. For all other kinds of declaration—such as properties, enumeration cases, and type aliases—you use the macro as a suffix. The following example uses the macro as a suffix to rename an enumeration:",
