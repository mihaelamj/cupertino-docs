For example, you can iterate over a range of `Int` and use sequence and collection methods.\n\n# Conforming to the Strideable Protocol\n\nTo add `Strideable` conformance to a custom type, choose a `Stride` type that can represent the distance between two instances and implement the `advanced(by:)` and `distance(to:)` methods.
