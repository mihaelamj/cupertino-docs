If `maxSplits + 1` subsequences are returned, the last one is a suffix of the original collection containing the remaining elements. `maxSplits` must be greater than or equal to zero. The default value is `Int.max`.\n- **omittingEmptySubsequences**: If `false`, an empty subsequence is returned in the result for each consecutive pair of `separator` elements in the collection and for each instance of `separator` at the start or end of the collection. If `true`, only nonempty subsequences are returned. The default value is `true`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn array of subsequences, split from this collection’s elements.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe resulting array consists of at most `maxSplits + 1` subsequences.
