If you’re working directly with numeric values, use the addition operator (`+`) instead of this method.\n\nIf this type’s `Stride` type conforms to `BinaryInteger`, then for a value `x`, a distance `n`, and a value `y = x.advanced(by: n)`, `x.distance(to: y) == n`. Using this method with types that have a noninteger `Stride` may result in an approximation. If the result of advancing by `n` is not representable as a value of this type, then a runtime error may occur.",
