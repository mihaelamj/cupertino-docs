  "overview" : "### Custom Actor Executors\n\nBy default, all actor types execute tasks on a shared global concurrent pool. The global pool does not guarantee any thread (or dispatch queue) affinity, so actors are free to use different threads as they execute tasks.\n\nSometimes it is important to be able to customize the execution behavior of an actor. For example, when an actor is known to perform heavy blocking operations (such as IO), and we would like to keep this work *off* the global shared pool, as blocking it may prevent other actors from being responsive.\n\nYou can implement a custom executor, by conforming a type to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/SerialExecutor] protocol, and implementing the `enqueue(_:)` method.\n\nOnce implemented, you can configure an actor to use such executor by implementing the actor’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/Actor\/unownedExecutor] computed property. For example, you could accept an executor in the actor’s initializer, store it as a variable (in order to retain it for the duration of the actor’s lifetime), and return it from the `unownedExecutor` computed property like this:\n\nIt is also possible to use a form of shared executor, either created as a global or static property, which you can then re-use for every MyActor instance:\n\nIn the example above, *all* “MyActor” instances would be using the same serial executor, which would result in only one of such actors ever being run at the same time. This may be useful if some of your code has some “specific thread” requirement when interoperating with non-Swift runtimes for example.\n\nSince the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/UnownedSerialExecutor] returned by the `unownedExecutor` property *does not* retain the executor, you must make sure the lifetime of it extends beyond the lifetime of any actor or task using it, as otherwise it may attempt to enqueue work on a released executor object, causing a crash. The executor returned by unownedExecutor *must* always be the same object, and returning different executors can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use existing serial executor implementations, such as Dispatch’s `DispatchSerialQueue` or others.",
