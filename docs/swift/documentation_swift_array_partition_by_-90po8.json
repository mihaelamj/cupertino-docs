All elements satisfying this predicate are ordered after all elements not satisfying it.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe index of the first element in the reordered collection that matches `belongsInSecondPartition`. If no elements in the collection match `belongsInSecondPartition`, the returned index is equal to the collection’s `endIndex`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAfter partitioning a collection, there is a pivot index `p` where no element before `p` satisfies the `belongsInSecondPartition` predicate and every element at or after `p` satisfies `belongsInSecondPartition`. This operation isn’t guaranteed to be stable, so the relative ordering of elements within the partitions might change.\n\nIn the following example, an array of numbers is partitioned by a predicate that matches elements greater than 30.\n\n```swift\nvar numbers = [30, 40, 20, 30, 30, 60, 10]\nlet p = numbers.partition(by: { $0 > 30 })\n\/\/ p == 5\n\/\/ numbers == [30, 10, 20, 30, 30, 60, 40]\n```\n\nThe `numbers` array is now arranged in two partitions. The first partition, `numbers[..<p]`, is made up of the elements that are not greater than 30. The second partition, `numbers[p...]`, is made up of the elements that *are* greater than 30.\n\n```swift\nlet first = numbers[..<p]\n\/\/ first == [30, 10, 20, 30, 30]\nlet second = numbers[p...]\n\/\/ second == [60, 40]\n```\n\nNote that the order of elements in both partitions changed. That is, `40` appears before `60` in the original collection, but, after calling `partition(by:)`, `60` appears before `40`.\n\n\n\n## Reordering an Array’s Elements\n\n- **sort()**: Sorts the collection in place.\n- **sort(by:)**: Sorts the collection in place, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.\n- **sorted()**: Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted.\n- **sorted(by:)**: Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.\n- **reverse()**: Reverses the elements of the collection in place.\n- **reversed()**: Returns a view presenting the elements of the collection in reverse order.\n- **shuffle()**: Shuffles the collection in place.\n- **shuffle(using:)**: Shuffles the collection in place, using the given generator as a source for randomness.\n- **shuffled()**: Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled.\n- **shuffled(using:)**: Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.\n- **swapAt(_:_:)**: Exchanges the values at the specified indices of the collection.\n\n",
