Typically, you use this to transform from one type of element to another.\n\nIn this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `5`. The closure provided to the `map(_:)` method takes each `Int` and looks up a corresponding `String` from a `romanNumeralDict` dictionary. This means the outer `for await in` loop iterates over `String` instances instead of the underlying `Int` values that `Counter` produces. Also, the dictionary doesn’t provide a key for `4`, and the closure throws an error for any key it can’t look up, so receiving this value from `Counter` ends the modified sequence with an error.",
