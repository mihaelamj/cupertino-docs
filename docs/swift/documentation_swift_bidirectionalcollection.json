Bidirectional collections can therefore offer additional operations, such as a `last` property that provides efficient access to the last element and a `reversed()` method that presents the elements in reverse order. In addition, bidirectional collections have more efficient implementations of some sequence and collection methods, such as `suffix(_:)`.\n\n# Conforming to the BidirectionalCollection Protocol\n\nTo add `BidirectionalProtocol` conformance to your custom types, implement the `index(before:)` method in addition to the requirements of the `Collection` protocol.\n\nIndices that are moved forward and backward in a bidirectional collection move by the same amount in each direction. That is, for any valid index `i` into a bidirectional collection `c`:\n\n- If `i >= c.startIndex && i < c.endIndex`, then `c.index(before: c.index(after: i)) == i`.\n- If `i > c.startIndex && i <= c.endIndex`, then `c.index(after: c.index(before: i)) == i`.\n\nValid indices are exactly those indices that are reachable from the collection’s `startIndex` by repeated applications of `index(after:)`, up to, and including, the `endIndex`.\n\n## Associated Types\n\n- **Element**: A type representing the sequence’s elements.\n- **Index**: A type that represents a position in the collection.\n- **Indices**: A type that represents the indices that are valid for subscripting the collection, in ascending order.\n- **SubSequence**: A collection representing a contiguous subrange of this collection’s elements.

immediately before the given index.\n- **joined(separator:)**: Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence, adding the given separator between each element.\n- **last(where:)**:

regex, created by the given closure.\n- **matches(of:)**: Returns a collection containing all matches of the specified regex.\n- **popLast()**: Removes and returns the last element of the collection.\n- **prefixMatch(of:)**: Matches part of the regex, starting at the beginning, where the regex is created by the given closure.\n- **prefixMatch(of:)**: Returns a match if this string is matched by the given regex at its start.\n- **ranges(of:)**: Finds and returns the ranges of the all occurrences of a given sequence within the collection.\n- **ranges(of:)**: Returns the ranges of
