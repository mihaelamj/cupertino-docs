When using such a declaration from another actor (or from nonisolated code), synchronization is performed through the shared actor instance to ensure mutually-exclusive access to the declaration.\n\n## Custom Actor Executors\n\nA global actor uses a custom executor if it needs to customize its execution semantics, for example, by making sure all of its invocations are run on a specific thread or dispatch queue.\n\nThis is done the same way as with normal non-global actors, by declaring a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/Actor\/unownedExecutor] nonisolated property in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/GlobalActor\/ActorType] underlying this global actor.\n\nIt is *not* necessary to override the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/GlobalActor\/sharedUnownedExecutor] static property of the global actor, as its default implementation already delegates to the `shared.unownedExecutor`, which is the most reasonable and correct implementation of this protocol requirement.\n\nYou can find out more about custom executors, by referring to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/SerialExecutor] protocol’s documentation.",
