Accessing memory as type `T` requires that the memory be bound to that type. A memory location may only be bound to one type at a time, so accessing the same memory as an unrelated type without first rebinding the memory is undefined.\n\nThe number of instances of `T` referenced by the rebound buffer may be different than the number of instances of `Element` referenced by the original buffer slice. The number of instances of `T` will be calculated at runtime.\n\nAny instance of `T` within the re-bound region may be initialized or uninitialized. Every instance of `Pointee` overlapping with a given instance of `T` should have the same initialization state (i.e. initialized or uninitialized.) Accessing a `T` whose underlying `Pointee` storage is in a mixed initialization state shall be undefined behaviour.\n\nBecause this range of memory is no longer bound to its `Element` type while the `body` closure executes, do not access memory using the original buffer slice from within `body`. Instead, use the `body` closure’s buffer argument to access the values in memory as instances of type `T`.\n\nAfter executing `body`, this method rebinds memory back to the original `Element` type.",

The type `T` must be layout compatible with the pointer’s `Element` type.\n- **body**: A closure that takes a typed buffer to the same memory as this buffer slice, only bound to type `T`. The buffer parameter contains a number of complete instances of `T` based on the capacity of the original buffer and the stride of `Element`. The closure’s buffer argument is valid only for the duration of the closure’s execution. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withMemoryRebound(to:_:)` method.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when you have a buffer slice of memory bound to one type and you need to access that memory as a buffer of another type.
