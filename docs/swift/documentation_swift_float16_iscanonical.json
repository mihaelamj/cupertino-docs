On platforms that fully support IEEE 754, every `Float` or `Double` value is canonical, but non-canonical values can exist on other platforms or for other types. Some examples:\n\n- On platforms that flush subnormal numbers to zero (such as armv7 with the default floating-point environment), Swift interprets subnormal `Float` and `Double` values as non-canonical zeros. (In Swift 5.1 and earlier, `isCanonical` is `true` for these values, which is the incorrect value.)\n- On i386 and x86_64, `Float80` has a number of non-canonical encodings. “Pseudo-NaNs”, “pseudo-infinities”, and “unnormals” are interpreted as non-canonical NaN encodings. “Pseudo-denormals” are interpreted as non-canonical encodings of subnormal values.\n- Decimal floating-point types admit a large number of non-canonical encodings. Consult the IEEE 754 standard for additional details.\n\n",
