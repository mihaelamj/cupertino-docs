If the closure has a return value, that value is also used as the return value of the `withUnsafePointer(to:_:)` function. The pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the function’s execution. It is undefined behavior to try to mutate through the pointer argument by converting it to `UnsafeMutablePointer` or any other mutable pointer type. If you need to mutate the argument through the pointer, use `withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)` instead.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe `withUnsafePointer(to:_:)` function is useful for calling Objective-C APIs that take in parameters by const pointer.\n\nThe pointer argument to `body` is valid only during the execution of `withUnsafePointer(to:_:)`. Do not store or return the pointer for later use.\n\n## Pointers to Values\n\n- **withUnsafePointer(to:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)**: Calls the given closure with a mutable pointer to the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeBytes(of:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeBytes(of:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeMutableBytes(of:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a mutable buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.\n\n",
