The default is an empty string.\n- **file**: The file name to print with `message`. The default is the file where `preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)` is called.\n- **line**: The line number to print along with `message`. The default is the line number where `preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)` is called.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this function to stop the program when control flow can only reach the call if your API was improperly used and execution flow is not expected to reach the call—for example, in the `default` case of a `switch` where you have knowledge that one of the other cases must be satisfied.\n\nThis function’s effect varies depending on the build flag used:\n\n- In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration), stops program execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.\n- In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode’s Release configuration), stops program execution.\n- In `-Ounchecked` builds, the optimizer may assume that this function is never called. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious programming error.\n\n## Testing\n\n- **assert(_:_:file:line:)**: Performs a traditional C-style assert with an optional message.\n- **assertionFailure(_:file:line:)**: Indicates that an internal consistency check failed.\n- **precondition(_:_:file:line:)**: Checks a necessary condition for making forward progress.\n\n",
