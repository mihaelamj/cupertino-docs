For example, you might want to create an array with the integers from 1 through 7. Use this initializer around a range instead of typing all those numbers in an array literal.\n\nYou can also use this initializer to convert a complex sequence or collection type back to an array. For example, the `keys` property of a dictionary isn’t an array with its own storage, it’s a collection that maps its elements from the dictionary only when they’re accessed, saving the time and space needed to allocate an array. If you need to pass those keys to a method that takes an array, however, use this initializer to convert that list from its type of `LazyMapCollection<Dictionary<String, Int>, Int>` to a simple `[String]`.",
