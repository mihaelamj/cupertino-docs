Swift deliberately avoids using the term “epsilon” because:\n\n- Historically “epsilon” has been used to refer to several different concepts in different languages, leading to confusion and bugs.\n- The name “epsilon” suggests that this quantity is a good tolerance to choose for approximate comparisons, but it is almost always unsuitable for that purpose.\n\nSee also the `ulp` member property.\n\n",
