In the `.success(_:)` case, this returns the associated value from the iterator’s `next()` method. If the result is the `failure(_:)` case, this call terminates the stream with the result’s error, by calling `finish(throwing:)`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA `YieldResult` that indicates the success or failure of the yield operation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf nothing is awaiting the next value and the result is success, this call attempts to buffer the result’s element.\n\nIf you call this method repeatedly, each call returns immediately, without blocking for any awaiting consumption from the iteration.\n\n## Producing Elements\n\n- **yield(_:)**: Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return normally from its suspension point with a given element.\n- **yield()**: Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return normally from its suspension point.\n- **AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.YieldResult**: A type that indicates the result of yielding a value to a client, by way of the continuation.\n\n",
