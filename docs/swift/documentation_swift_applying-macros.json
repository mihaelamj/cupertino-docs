Calling a macro is always additive: The macro adds new code alongside the code that you wrote, but never modifies or deletes code that’s already part of your project.\n\nMany libraries provide macros, including the Swift standard library and many frameworks. You can also write your own macros.\n\nBecause macros generate Swift code, you use the same tools for development and debugging, regardless of whether your code uses macros.\n\n\n\n### Call a Macro\n\nThe syntax you use to call a macro varies slightly, depending on whether you attach the macro to a declaration.\n\nTo attach a macro to a declaration, write an at sign (`@`) before the macro’s name and write any macro arguments after its name. This syntax is the same as writing an attribute. For example:\n\nA macro that’s attached to a declaration generates code and adds that code to the declaration. For example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Observation\/Observable()] macro in the code above adds additional members to the `MyObject` class so it implements the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Observation\/Observable] protocol, and marks `MyObject` as conforming to `Observable`.\n\nTo call a macro without attaching it to a declaration, write a number sign (`#`) before the macro’s name and write any macro arguments after its name. This syntax is the same as `#if` and other compile-time operations. For example:\n\nA macro that isn’t attached to a declaration generates code and adds that code in the location where where you call the macro. For example, the `Predicate` macro in the code above creates an instance of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Predicate] structure.\n\nFor more information, see [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/macros] in [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language].\n\n### Inspect an Expanded Macro\n\nWhen you build your project, Swift reads your code and finds the places where you call a macro.
