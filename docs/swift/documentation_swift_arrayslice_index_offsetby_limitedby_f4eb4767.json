The operation doesn’t require going beyond the limiting `numbers.endIndex` value, so it succeeds.\n\nThe next example attempts to retrieve an index ten positions from `numbers.startIndex`, but fails, because that distance is beyond the index passed as `limit`.\n\nThe value passed as `distance` must not offset `i` beyond the bounds of the collection, unless the index passed as `limit` prevents offsetting beyond those bounds.",
