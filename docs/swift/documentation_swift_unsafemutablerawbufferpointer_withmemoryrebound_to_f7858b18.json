Accessing memory as a type `T` requires that the memory be bound to that type. A memory location may only be bound to one type at a time, so accessing the same memory as an unrelated type without first rebinding the memory is undefined.\n\nAny instance of `T` within the re-bound region may be initialized or uninitialized. The memory underlying any individual instance of `T` must have the same initialization state (i.e.  initialized or uninitialized.) Accessing a `T` whose underlying memory is in a mixed initialization state shall be undefined behaviour.\n\nIf the byte count of the original buffer is not a multiple of the stride of `T`, then the re-bound buffer is shorter than the original buffer.\n\nAfter executing `body`, this method rebinds memory back to its original binding state. This can be unbound memory, or bound to a different type.",

The closure’s pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the closure’s execution. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withMemoryRebound(to:capacity:_:)` method.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when you have a buffer to raw memory and you need to access that memory as instances of a given type `T`.
