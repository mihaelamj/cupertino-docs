The sequence ends either when the last sequence created from the last element from base sequence ends, or when `transform` throws an error.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to receive a single-level asynchronous sequence when your transformation produces an asynchronous sequence for each element.\n\nIn this example, an asynchronous sequence called `Counter` produces `Int` values from `1` to `5`. The transforming closure takes the received `Int` and returns a new `Counter` that counts that high. For example, when the transform receives `3` from the base sequence, it creates a new `Counter` that produces the values `1`, `2`, and `3`. The `flatMap(_:)` method “flattens” the resulting sequence-of-sequences into a single `AsyncSequence`. However, when the closure receives `4`, it throws an error, terminating the sequence.",
