Note that the `inout` exclusivity rules mean that, like any other `inout` argument, `value` cannot be directly accessed by other code for the duration of `body`. Access must only occur through the pointer argument to `body` until `body` returns.\n- **body**: A closure that takes a raw buffer pointer to the bytes of `value` as its sole argument. If the closure has a return value, that value is also used as the return value of the `withUnsafeBytes(of:_:)` function. The buffer pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the closure’s execution. It is undefined behavior to attempt to mutate through the pointer by conversion to `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` or any other mutable pointer type. If you want to mutate a value by writing through a pointer, use `withUnsafeMutableBytes(of:_:)` instead.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe buffer pointer argument to the `body` closure provides a collection interface to the raw bytes of `value`. The buffer is the size of the instance passed as `value` and does not include any remote storage.\n\n## Pointers to Values\n\n- **withUnsafePointer(to:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.\n- **withUnsafePointer(to:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a pointer to the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeMutablePointer(to:_:)**: Calls the given closure with a mutable pointer to the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeBytes(of:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.\n- **withUnsafeMutableBytes(of:_:)**: Invokes the given closure with a mutable buffer pointer covering the raw bytes of the given argument.\n\n",
