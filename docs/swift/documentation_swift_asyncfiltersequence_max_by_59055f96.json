If the sequence has no elements, returns `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when the asynchronous sequence’s values don’t conform to `Comparable`, or when you want to apply a custom ordering to the sequence.\n\nThe predicate must be a *strict weak ordering* over the elements. That is, for any elements `a`, `b`, and `c`, the following conditions must hold:\n\n- `areInIncreasingOrder(a, a)` is always `false`. (Irreflexivity)\n- If `areInIncreasingOrder(a, b)` and `areInIncreasingOrder(b, c)` are both `true`, then `areInIncreasingOrder(a, c)` is also `true`. (Transitive comparability)\n- Two elements are *incomparable* if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If `a` and `b` are incomparable, and `b` and `c` are incomparable, then `a` and `c` are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)\n\nThe following example uses an enumeration of playing cards ranks, `Rank`, which ranges from `ace` (low) to `king` (high). An asynchronous sequence called `RankCounter` produces all elements of the array. The predicate provided to the `max(by:)` method sorts ranks based on their `rawValue`:\n\n```swift\nenum Rank: Int {\n    case ace = 1, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king\n}\n\nlet max = await RankCounter()\n    .max { $0.rawValue < $1.rawValue }\nprint(max ?? \"none\")\n\/\/ Prints \"king\"\n```\n\n",
