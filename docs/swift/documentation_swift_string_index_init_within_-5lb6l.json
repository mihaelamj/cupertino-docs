For example, because UTF-8 and UTF-16 represent high Unicode code points differently, an attempt to convert the position of the trailing surrogate of a UTF-16 surrogate pair fails.\n\nThe next example attempts to convert the indices of the two UTF-16 code points that represent the teacup emoji (`\"🍵\"`). The index of the lead surrogate is successfully converted to a position in `utf8`, but the index of the trailing surrogate is not.",
