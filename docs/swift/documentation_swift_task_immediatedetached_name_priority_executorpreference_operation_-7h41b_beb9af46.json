Pass `nil` to use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/Task\/basePriority] of the current task (if there is one).\n- **taskExecutor**: The task executor that the child task should be started on and keep using. Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to no preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/globalConcurrentExecutor] global executor explicitly.\n- **operation**: The operation to be run immediately upon entering the task.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA reference to the unstructured task which may be awaited on.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function *starts* the created task on the calling context. The task will continue executing on the caller’s context until it suspends, and after suspension will resume on the adequate executor.
