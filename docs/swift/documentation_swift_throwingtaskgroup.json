In most cases, the Swift type system prevents a task group from escaping like that because adding a child task to a task group is a mutating operation, and mutation operations can’t be performed from concurrent execution contexts like a child task.\n\nRefer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/TaskGroup] documentation for detailed discussion of semantics shared between all task groups.\n\n### Cancellation behavior\n\nA task group becomes canceled in one of the following ways:\n\n- when [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/ThrowingTaskGroup\/cancelAll()] is invoked on it,\n- when an error is thrown out of the `withThrowingTaskGroup(...) { }` closure,\n- when the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/Task] running this task group is canceled.\n\nSince a `ThrowingTaskGroup` is a structured concurrency primitive, cancellation is automatically propagated through all of its child-tasks (and their child tasks).\n\nA canceled task group can still keep adding tasks, however they will start being immediately canceled, and may act accordingly to this. To avoid adding new tasks to an already canceled task group, use `addTaskUnlessCancelled(priority:body:)` rather than the plain `addTask(priority:body:)` which adds tasks unconditionally.\n\nFor information about the language-level concurrency model that `ThrowingTaskGroup` is part of, see [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/LanguageGuide\/Concurrency.html] in [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Adding Tasks to a Throwing Task Group\n\n- **addTask(priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group.\n- **addTask(executorPreference:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group.\n- **addTask(name:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group.\n- **addTask(name:executorPreference:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group.\n- **addTaskUnlessCancelled(priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group, unless the group has been canceled. Returns a boolean value indicating if the task was successfully added to the group or not.\n- **addTaskUnlessCancelled(name:executorPreference:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group, unless the group has been canceled. Returns a boolean value indicating if the task was successfully added to the group or not.\n- **addTaskUnlessCancelled(executorPreference:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group, unless the group has been canceled. Returns a boolean value indicating if the task was successfully added to the group or not.\n- **addTaskUnlessCancelled(name:priority:operation:)**: Adds a child task to the group, unless the group has been canceled.
