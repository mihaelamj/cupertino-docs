For values `x` and `y` and their truncated integer quotient `q`, the remainder `r` satisfies `x == y * q + r`.\n\nThe following example calculates the truncating remainder of dividing 8.625 by 0.75:\n\nIf this value and `other` are both finite numbers, the truncating remainder has the same sign as this value and is strictly smaller in magnitude than `other`.
