  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nUse the masking left shift operator (`&<<`) when you need to perform a shift and are sure that the shift amount is in the range `0..<lhs.bitWidth`. Before shifting, the masking left shift operator masks the shift to this range. The shift is performed using this masked value.\n\nThe following example defines `x` as an instance of `UInt8`, an 8-bit, unsigned integer type. If you use `2` as the right-hand-side value in an operation on `x`, the shift amount requires no masking.\n\nHowever, if you use `8` as the shift amount, the method first masks the shift amount to zero, and then performs the shift, resulting in no change to the original value.\n\nIf the bit width of the shifted integer type is a power of two, masking is performed using a bitmask; otherwise, masking is performed using a modulo operation.",
