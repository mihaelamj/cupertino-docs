Unlike traditional truncating multiplication, the `multipliedFullWidth(by:)` method returns a tuple containing both the `high` and `low` parts of the product of this value and `other`. The following example uses this method to multiply two `Int8` values that normally overflow when multiplied:\n\nThe product of `x` and `y` is `-1920`, which is too large to represent in an `Int8` instance. The `high` and `low` components of the `result` value represent `-1920` when concatenated to form a double-width integer; that is, using `result.high` as the high byte and `result.low` as the low byte of an `Int16` instance.",
