The transforming closure takes the received `Int` and returns a new `Counter` that counts that high. For example, when the transform receives `3` from the base sequence, it creates a new `Counter` that produces the values `1`, `2`, and `3`. The `flatMap(_:)` method “flattens” the resulting sequence-of-sequences into a single `AsyncSequence`.",
