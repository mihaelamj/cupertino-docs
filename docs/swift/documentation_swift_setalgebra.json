In the standard library, you can use the `Set` type with elements of any hashable type, or you can easily create bit masks with `SetAlgebra` conformance using the `OptionSet` protocol. See those types for more information.\n\n# Conforming to the SetAlgebra Protocol\n\nWhen implementing a custom type that conforms to the `SetAlgebra` protocol, you must implement the required initializers and methods. For the inherited methods to work properly, conforming types must meet the following axioms. Assume that `S` is a custom type that conforms to the `SetAlgebra` protocol, `x` and `y` are instances of `S`, and `e` is of type `S.Element`—the type that the set holds.",
