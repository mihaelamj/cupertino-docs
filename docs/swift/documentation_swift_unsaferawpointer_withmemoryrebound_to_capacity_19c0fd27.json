Accessing a `T` whose underlying memory is in a mixed initialization state shall be undefined behaviour.\n\nThe following example temporarily rebinds a raw memory pointer to `Int64`, then accesses a property on the signed integer.\n\nAfter executing `body`, this method rebinds memory back to its original binding state.

This pointer must be a multiple of this type’s alignment.\n- **count**: The number of instances of `T` in the re-bound region.\n- **body**: A closure that takes a typed pointer to the same memory as this pointer, only bound to type `T`. The closure’s pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the closure’s execution. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withMemoryRebound(to:capacity:_:)` method.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when you have a pointer to raw memory and you need to access that memory as instances of a given type `T`.
