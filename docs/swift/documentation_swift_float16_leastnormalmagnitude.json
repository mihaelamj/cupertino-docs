There may be smaller positive numbers, but they are *subnormal*, meaning that they are represented with less precision than normal numbers.\n\nThis value corresponds to type-specific C macros such as `FLT_MIN` and `DBL_MIN`. The naming of those macros is slightly misleading, because subnormals, zeros, and negative numbers are smaller than this value.",
