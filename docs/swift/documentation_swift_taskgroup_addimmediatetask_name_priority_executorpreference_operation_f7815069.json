Omit this parameter or pass `nil` to inherit the task group’s base priority.\n- **taskExecutor**: The task executor that the child task should be started on and keep using. Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to calling the `addImmediateTask` method without a preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/globalConcurrentExecutor] global executor explicitly.\n- **operation**: The operation to execute as part of the task group.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function *starts* the created task on the calling context.
