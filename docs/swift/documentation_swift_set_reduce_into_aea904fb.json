If the sequence has no elements, the result is `initialResult`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse the `reduce(into:_:)` method to produce a single value from the elements of an entire sequence. For example, you can use this method on an array of integers to filter adjacent equal entries or count frequencies.\n\nThis method is preferred over `reduce(_:_:)` for efficiency when the result is a copy-on-write type, for example an Array or a Dictionary.\n\nThe `updateAccumulatingResult` closure is called sequentially with a mutable accumulating value initialized to `initialResult` and each element of the sequence. This example shows how to build a dictionary of letter frequencies of a string.\n\n```swift\nlet letters = \"abracadabra\"\nlet letterCount = letters.reduce(into: [:]) { counts, letter in\n    counts[letter, default: 0] += 1\n}\n\/\/ letterCount == [\"a\": 5, \"b\": 2, \"r\": 2, \"c\": 1, \"d\": 1]\n```\n\nWhen `letters.reduce(into:_:)` is called, the following steps occur:\n\n1. The `updateAccumulatingResult` closure is called with the initial accumulating value—`[:]` in this case—and the first character of `letters`, modifying the accumulating value by setting `1` for the key `\"a\"`.\n2. The closure is called again repeatedly with the updated accumulating value and each element of the sequence.\n3. When the sequence is exhausted, the accumulating value is returned to the caller.\n\nIf the sequence has no elements, `updateAccumulatingResult` is never executed and `initialResult` is the result of the call to `reduce(into:_:)`.\n\n\n\n## Transforming a Set\n\n- **compactMap(_:)**: Returns an array containing the non-`nil` results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.\n- **flatMap(_:)**: Returns an array containing the concatenated results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.\n- **flatMap(_:)**\n- **reduce(_:_:)**: Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.\n- **sorted()**: Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted.\n- **sorted(by:)**: Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.\n- **shuffled()**: Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled.\n- **shuffled(using:)**: Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.\n- **lazy**: A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as `map` and `filter`, are implemented lazily.\n\n",
