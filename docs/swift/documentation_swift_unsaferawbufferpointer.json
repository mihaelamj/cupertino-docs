  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYou can use an `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` instance in low-level operations to eliminate uniqueness checks and release mode bounds checks. Bounds checks are always performed in debug mode.\n\nAn `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` instance is a view of the raw bytes in a region of memory. Each byte in memory is viewed as a `UInt8` value independent of the type of values held in that memory. Reading from memory through a raw buffer is an untyped operation.\n\nIn addition to its collection interface, an `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` instance also supports the `load(fromByteOffset:as:)` and `loadUnaligned(fromByteOffset:as:)` methods provided by `UnsafeRawPointer`, including bounds checks in debug mode.\n\nTo access the underlying memory through typed operations, the memory must be bound to a trivial type.\n\n# UnsafeRawBufferPointer Semantics\n\nAn `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` instance is a view into memory and does not own the memory that it references. Copying a variable or constant of type `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` does not copy the underlying memory. However, initializing another collection with an `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` instance copies bytes out of the referenced memory and into the new collection.\n\nThe following example uses `someBytes`, an `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` instance, to demonstrate the difference between assigning a buffer pointer and using a buffer pointer as the source for another collection’s elements. Here, the assignment to `destBytes` creates a new, nonowning buffer pointer covering the first `n` bytes of the memory that `someBytes` references—nothing is copied:\n\nNext, the bytes referenced by `destBytes` are copied into `byteArray`, a new `[UInt8]` array, and then the remainder of `someBytes` is appended to `byteArray`:",
