Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nfunc split(maxSplits: Int = Int.max, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool = true, whereSeparator isSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [ArraySlice<Self.Element>]\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **maxSplits**: The maximum number of times to split the sequence, or one less than the number of subsequences to return. If `maxSplits + 1` subsequences are returned, the last one is a suffix of the original sequence containing the remaining elements. `maxSplits` must be greater than or equal to zero. The default value is `Int.max`.\n- **omittingEmptySubsequences**: If `false`, an empty subsequence is returned in the result for each pair of consecutive elements satisfying the `isSeparator` predicate and for each element at the start or end of the sequence satisfying the `isSeparator` predicate. If `true`, only nonempty subsequences are returned. The default value is `true`.\n- **isSeparator**: A closure that returns `true` if its argument should be used to split the sequence; otherwise, `false`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn array of subsequences, split from this sequence’s elements.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe following examples show the effects of the `maxSplits` and `omittingEmptySubsequences` parameters when splitting a string using a closure that matches spaces. The first use of `split` returns each word that was originally separated by one or more spaces.\n\n```swift\nlet line = \"BLANCHE:   I don't want realism.
