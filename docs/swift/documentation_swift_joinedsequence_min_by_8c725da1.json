If the sequence has no elements, returns `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe predicate must be a *strict weak ordering* over the elements. That is, for any elements `a`, `b`, and `c`, the following conditions must hold:\n\n- `areInIncreasingOrder(a, a)` is always `false`. (Irreflexivity)\n- If `areInIncreasingOrder(a, b)` and `areInIncreasingOrder(b, c)` are both `true`, then `areInIncreasingOrder(a, c)` is also `true`. (Transitive comparability)\n- Two elements are *incomparable* if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If `a` and `b` are incomparable, and `b` and `c` are incomparable, then `a` and `c` are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)\n\nThis example shows how to use the `min(by:)` method on a dictionary to find the key-value pair with the lowest value.\n\n```swift\nlet hues = [\"Heliotrope\": 296, \"Coral\": 16, \"Aquamarine\": 156]\nlet leastHue = hues.min { a, b in a.value < b.value }\nprint(leastHue)\n\/\/ Prints \"Optional((key: \"Coral\", value: 16))\"\n```\n\n\n\n",
