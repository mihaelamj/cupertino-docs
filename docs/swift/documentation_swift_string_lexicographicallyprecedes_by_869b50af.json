That is, for any elements `a`, `b`, and `c`, the following conditions must hold:\n\n- `areInIncreasingOrder(a, a)` is always `false`. (Irreflexivity)\n- If `areInIncreasingOrder(a, b)` and `areInIncreasingOrder(b, c)` are both `true`, then `areInIncreasingOrder(a, c)` is also `true`. (Transitive comparability)\n- Two elements are *incomparable* if neither is ordered before the other according to the predicate. If `a` and `b` are incomparable, and `b` and `c` are incomparable, then `a` and `c` are also incomparable. (Transitive incomparability)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Comparing Characters\n\n- **elementsEqual(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.\n- **elementsEqual(_:by:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.\n- **starts(with:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements in another sequence.\n- **starts(with:by:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.\n- **lexicographicallyPrecedes(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the less-than operator (`<`) to compare elements.\n\n",
