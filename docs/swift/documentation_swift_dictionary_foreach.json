You cannot use a `break` or `continue` statement to exit the current call of the `body` closure or skip subsequent calls.\n2. Using the `return` statement in the `body` closure will exit only from the current call to `body`, not from any outer scope, and won’t skip subsequent calls.\n\n## Iterating over Keys and Values\n\n- **enumerated()**: Returns a sequence of pairs (*n*, *x*), where *n* represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and *x* represents an element of the sequence.\n- **lazy**: A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as `map` and `filter`, are implemented lazily.\n- **makeIterator()**: Returns an iterator over the dictionary’s key-value pairs.\n- **underestimatedCount**: A value less than or equal to the number of elements in the collection.\n\n",
