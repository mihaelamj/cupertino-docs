It does not copy the elements from the collection into separate storage. Thus, creating a slice has O(1) complexity.\n\n## Slices Share Indices\n\nIndices of a slice can be used interchangeably with indices of the base collection. An element of a slice is located under the same index in the slice and in the base collection, as long as neither the collection nor the slice has been mutated since the slice was created.\n\nFor example, suppose you have an array holding the number of absences from each class during a session.\n\n```swift\nvar absences = [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0]\n```\n\nYou’re tasked with finding the day with the most absences in the second half of the session. To find the index of the day in question, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a slice of the `absences` array that holds the second half of the days.\n2. Use the `max(by:)` method to determine the index of the day with the most absences.\n3. Print the result using the index found in step 2 on the original `absences` array.\n\nHere’s an implementation of those steps:\n\n```swift\nlet secondHalf = absences.suffix(absences.count \/ 2)\nif let i = secondHalf.indices.max(by: { secondHalf[$0] < secondHalf[$1] }) {\n    print(\"Highest second-half absences: \\(absences[i])\")\n}\n\/\/ Prints \"Highest second-half absences: 3\"\n```\n\n## Slices Inherit Semantics\n\nA slice inherits the value or reference semantics of its base collection. That is, if a `Slice` instance is wrapped around a mutable collection that has value semantics, such as an array, mutating the original collection would trigger a copy of that collection, and not affect the base collection stored inside of the slice.\n\nFor example, if you update the last element of the `absences` array from `0` to `2`, the `secondHalf` slice is unchanged.\n\n```swift\nabsences[7] = 2\nprint(absences)\n\/\/ Prints \"[0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 1, 2]\"\nprint(secondHalf)\n\/\/ Prints \"[0, 3, 1, 0]\"\n```\n\nUse slices only for transient computation.
