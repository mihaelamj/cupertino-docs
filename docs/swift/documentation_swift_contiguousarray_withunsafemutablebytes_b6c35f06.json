If no such storage exists, it is created. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withUnsafeMutableBytes(_:)` method. The argument is valid only for the duration of the closure’s execution.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe array’s `Element` type must be a *trivial type*, which can be copied with just a bit-for-bit copy without any indirection or reference-counting operations.
