If there is no upper limit, then `significandBitCount` should be `Int.max`.\n\nNote that `Float80.significandBitCount` is 63, even though 64 bits are used to store the significand in the memory representation of a `Float80` (unlike other floating-point types, `Float80` explicitly stores the leading integral significand bit, but the `BinaryFloatingPoint` APIs provide an abstraction so that users don’t need to be aware of this detail).",
