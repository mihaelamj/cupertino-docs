After the call, the memory referenced by the buffer up to, but not including, the returned index is initialized. The buffer must contain sufficient memory to accommodate `source.underestimatedCount`.\n\nThe returned index is the position of the next uninitialized element in the buffer, which is one past the last element written. If `source` contains no elements, the returned index is equal to the buffer’s `startIndex`. If `source` contains an equal or greater number of elements than the buffer can hold, the returned index is equal to the buffer’s `endIndex`.",
