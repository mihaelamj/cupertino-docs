The `nextPartialResult` closure receives `initialResult` the first time the closure executes.\n- **updateAccumulatingResult**: A closure that combines an accumulating value and an element of the asynchronous sequence into a new accumulating value, for use in the next call of the `nextPartialResult` closure or returned to the caller.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe final accumulated value.
