Don’t store an unsafe task reference for use outside that method’s closure. Storing an unsafe reference doesn’t affect the task’s actual life cycle, and the behavior of accessing an unsafe task reference outside of the `withUnsafeCurrentTask(body:)` method’s closure isn’t defined.\n\nOnly APIs on `UnsafeCurrentTask` that are also part of `Task` are safe to invoke from a task other than the task that this `UnsafeCurrentTask` instance refers to. Calling other APIs from another task is undefined behavior, breaks invariants in other parts of the program running on this task, and may lead to crashes or data loss.\n\nFor information about the language-level concurrency model that `UnsafeCurrentTask` is part of, see [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/LanguageGuide\/Concurrency.html] in [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/].",
