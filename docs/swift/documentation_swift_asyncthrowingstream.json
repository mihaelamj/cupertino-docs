  "overview" : "## Overview\n\n`AsyncThrowingStream` conforms to `AsyncSequence`, providing a convenient way to create an asynchronous sequence without manually implementing an asynchronous iterator. In particular, an asynchronous stream is well-suited to adapt callback- or delegation-based APIs to participate with `async`-`await`.\n\nIn contrast to `AsyncStream`, this type can throw an error from the awaited `next()`, which terminates the stream with the thrown error.\n\nYou initialize an `AsyncThrowingStream` with a closure that receives an `AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation`. Produce elements in this closure, then provide them to the stream by calling the continuation’s `yield(_:)` method. When there are no further elements to produce, call the continuation’s `finish()` method. This causes the sequence iterator to produce a `nil`, which terminates the sequence. If an error occurs, call the continuation’s `finish(throwing:)` method, which causes the iterator’s `next()` method to throw the error to the awaiting call point. The continuation is `Sendable`, which permits calling it from concurrent contexts external to the iteration of the `AsyncThrowingStream`.\n\nAn arbitrary source of elements can produce elements faster than they are consumed by a caller iterating over them. Because of this, `AsyncThrowingStream` defines a buffering behavior, allowing the stream to buffer a specific number of oldest or newest elements.

In particular, an asynchronous stream is well-suited to adapt callback- or delegation-based APIs to participate with `async`-`await`.\n\nIn contrast to `AsyncStream`, this type can throw an error from the awaited `next()`, which terminates the stream with the thrown error.\n\nYou initialize an `AsyncThrowingStream` with a closure that receives an `AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation`. Produce elements in this closure, then provide them to the stream by calling the continuation’s `yield(_:)` method. When there are no further elements to produce, call the continuation’s `finish()` method. This causes the sequence iterator to produce a `nil`, which terminates the sequence. If an error occurs, call the continuation’s `finish(throwing:)` method, which causes the iterator’s `next()` method to throw the error to the awaiting call point.

Because of this, `AsyncThrowingStream` defines a buffering behavior, allowing the stream to buffer a specific number of oldest or newest elements. By default, the buffer limit is `Int.max`, which means it’s unbounded.\n\n### Adapting Existing Code to Use Streams\n\nTo adapt existing callback code to use `async`-`await`, use the callbacks to provide values to the stream, by using the continuation’s `yield(_:)` method.\n\nConsider a hypothetical `QuakeMonitor` type that provides callers with `Quake` instances every time it detects an earthquake. To receive callbacks, callers set a custom closure as the value of the monitor’s `quakeHandler` property, which the monitor calls back as necessary. Callers can also set an `errorHandler` to receive asynchronous error notifications, such as the monitor service suddenly becoming unavailable.\n\n```swift\nclass QuakeMonitor {\n    var quakeHandler: ((Quake) -> Void)?\n    var errorHandler: ((Error) -> Void)?\n\n    func startMonitoring() {…}\n    func stopMonitoring() {…}\n}\n```\n\nTo adapt this to use `async`-`await`, extend the `QuakeMonitor` to add a `quakes` property, of type `AsyncThrowingStream<Quake>`. In the getter for this property, return an `AsyncThrowingStream`, whose `build` closure – called at runtime to create the stream – uses the continuation to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Creates a `QuakeMonitor` instance.\n2. Sets the monitor’s `quakeHandler` property to a closure that receives each `Quake` instance and forwards it to the stream by calling the continuation’s `yield(_:)` method.\n3. Sets the monitor’s `errorHandler` property to a closure that receives any error from the monitor and forwards it to the stream by calling the continuation’s `finish(throwing:)` method. This causes the stream’s iterator to throw the error and terminate the stream.\n4. Sets the continuation’s `onTermination` property to a closure that calls `stopMonitoring()` on the monitor.\n5. Calls `startMonitoring` on the `QuakeMonitor`.\n\n```swift\nextension QuakeMonitor {\n\n    static var throwingQuakes: AsyncThrowingStream<Quake, Error> {\n        AsyncThrowingStream { continuation in\n            let monitor = QuakeMonitor()\n            monitor.quakeHandler = { quake in\n                 continuation.yield(quake)\n            }\n            monitor.errorHandler = { error in\n                continuation.finish(throwing: error)\n            }\n            continuation.onTermination = { @Sendable _ in\n                monitor.stopMonitoring()\n            }\n            monitor.startMonitoring()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBecause the stream is an `AsyncSequence`, the call point uses the `for`-`await`-`in` syntax to process each `Quake` instance as produced by the stream:\n\n```swift\ndo {\n    for try await quake in quakeStream {\n        print(\"Quake: \\(quake.date)\")\n    }\n    print(\"Stream done.\")\n} catch {\n    print(\"Error: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Creating a Continuation-Based Stream\n\n- **init(_:bufferingPolicy:_:)**: Constructs an asynchronous stream for an element type, using the specified buffering policy and
