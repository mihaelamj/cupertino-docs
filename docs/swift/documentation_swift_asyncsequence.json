An `AsyncSequence` may have all, some, or none of its values available when you first use it. Instead, you use `await` to receive values as they become available.\n\nAs with `Sequence`, you typically iterate through an `AsyncSequence` with a `for await`-`in` loop. However, because the caller must potentially wait for values, you use the `await` keyword. The following example shows how to iterate over `Counter`, a custom `AsyncSequence` that produces `Int` values from `1` up to a `howHigh` value:\n\nAn `AsyncSequence` doesn’t generate or contain the values; it just defines how you access them. Along with defining the type of values as an associated type called `Element`, the `AsyncSequence` defines a `makeAsyncIterator()` method. This returns an instance of type `AsyncIterator`. Like the standard `IteratorProtocol`, the `AsyncIteratorProtocol` defines a single `next()` method to produce elements. The difference is that the `AsyncIterator` defines its `next()` method as `async`, which requires a caller to wait for the next value with the `await` keyword.\n\n`AsyncSequence` also defines methods for processing the elements you receive, modeled on the operations provided by the basic `Sequence` in the standard library. There are two categories of methods: those that return a single value, and those that return another `AsyncSequence`.\n\nSingle-value methods eliminate the need for a `for await`-`in` loop, and instead let you make a single `await` call. For example, the `contains(_:)` method returns a Boolean value that indicates if a given value exists in the `AsyncSequence`.
