If `x \/ y` is exactly halfway between two integers, `q` is chosen to be even. Note that `q` is *not* `x \/ y` computed in floating-point arithmetic, and that `q` may not be representable in any available integer type.\n\nThe following example calculates the remainder of dividing 8.625 by 0.75:\n\nIf this value and `other` are finite numbers, the remainder is in the closed range `-abs(other \/ 2)...abs(other \/ 2)`.
