The `withVaList(_:_:)` function takes an array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/CVarArg] values and provides a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/CVaListPointer] value within the body of a closure parameter, whereas the `getVaList(_:)` function returns this value directly. With either function, you pass the resulting `CVaListPointer` value as the `va_list` argument of the C variadic function.\n\nFor example, here’s how to call the `vasprintf(_:_:_:)` function in Swift:\n\nSwift only imports C variadic functions that use a `va_list` for their arguments. C functions that use the `...` syntax for variadic arguments are not imported, and therefore can’t be called using `CVarArg` arguments.\n\n### Call Functions with Pointer Parameters\n\nWhenever possible, Swift avoids giving you direct access to pointers. When importing C function parameters, however, Swift maps pointer parameters to standard library pointer types. The following tables use `Type` as a placeholder type name to indicate syntax for the mappings.\n\nFor return types, variables, and arguments, the following mappings apply:\n\nFor class types, the following mappings apply:\n\nFor pointers to untyped, raw memory, the following mappings apply:\n\nC function pointers are imported into Swift as closures with the C function pointer calling convention, denoted by the `@convention(c)` attribute. For example, a function pointer that has the type `int (*)(void)` in C is imported into Swift as `@convention(c) () -> Int32`.\n\nIf the type of the value pointed to by a C pointer cannot be represented by Swift, as is the case with an incomplete struct type, the pointer is imported as an `OpaquePointer`.",
