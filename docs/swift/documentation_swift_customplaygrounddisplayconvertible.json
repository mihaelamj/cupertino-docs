If you want to provide a custom description of your type to be logged in place of the default description, conform to the `CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible` protocol.\n\nPlayground logging generates a richer, more specialized description of core types. For example, the contents of a `String` are logged, as are the components of an `NSColor` or `UIColor`. The current playground logging implementation logs specialized descriptions of at least the following types:\n\nPlayground logging may also be able to support specialized descriptions of other types.\n\n## Conforming to the CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible Protocol\n\nTo add `CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible` conformance to your custom type, implement the `playgroundDescription` property. If your implementation returns an instance of one of the types above, that type’s specialized description is used. If you return any other type, a structured description is generated.\n\nIf your type has value semantics, the `playgroundDescription` should be unaffected by subsequent mutations, if possible.\n\nIf your type’s `playgroundDescription` returns an instance which itself conforms to `CustomPlaygroundDisplayConvertible`, then that type’s `playgroundDescription` will be used, and so on. To prevent infinite loops, playground logging implementations can place a reasonable limit on this kind of chaining.",
