Because this allocator is stack disciplined, explicitly deallocating memory out-of-order will cause your program to abort.\n\n## Instance Methods\n\n- **allocate(as:)**: Allocate uninitialized memory for a single instance of type `T`.\n- **allocate(capacity:)**: Allocate a specified number of bytes of uninitialized memory.\n- **allocate(capacity:as:)**: Allocate uninitialized memory for the specified number of instances of type `T`.\n- **deallocate(_:)**: Deallocate previously allocated memory.  Note that the task allocator is stack disciplined, so if you deallocate a block of memory, all memory allocated after that block is also deallocated.\n- **deallocate(_:)**: Deallocate previously allocated memory.  Note that the task allocator is stack disciplined, so if you deallocate a block of memory, all memory allocated after that block is also deallocated.\n- **deallocate(_:)**: Deallocate previously allocated memory.
