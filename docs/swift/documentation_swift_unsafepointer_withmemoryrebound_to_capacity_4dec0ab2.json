Accessing memory as a type `T` requires that the memory be bound to that type. A memory location may only be bound to one type at a time, so accessing the same memory as an unrelated type without first rebinding the memory is undefined.\n\nThe region of memory that starts at this pointer and covers `count` strides of `T` instances must be bound to `Pointee`. Any instance of `T` within the re-bound region may be initialized or uninitialized. Every instance of `Pointee` overlapping with a given instance of `T` should have the same initialization state (i.e. initialized or uninitialized.) Accessing a `T` whose underlying `Pointee` storage is in a mixed initialization state shall be undefined behaviour.\n\nThe following example temporarily rebinds the memory of a `UInt64` pointer to `Int64`, then accesses a property on the signed integer.\n\nBecause this pointer’s memory is no longer bound to its `Pointee` type while the `body` closure executes, do not access memory using the original pointer from within `body`.

The closure’s pointer argument is valid only for the duration of the closure’s execution. If `body` has a return value, that value is also used as the return value for the `withMemoryRebound(to:capacity:_:)` method.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe return value, if any, of the `body` closure parameter.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when you have a pointer to memory bound to one type and you need to access that memory as instances of another type.
