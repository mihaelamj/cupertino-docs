The first component of the tuple is the full portion of the string that was matched, with the remaining components holding the captures.\n\n## Supporting types\n\n- **RegexComponent.DateStyle**: A type alias to use when matching date components in a regular expression.\n- **RegexComponent.TimeStyle**: A type alias to use when matching time components in a regular expression.\n\n",
