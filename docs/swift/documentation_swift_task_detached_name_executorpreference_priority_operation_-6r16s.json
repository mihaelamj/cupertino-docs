Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to no preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/globalConcurrentExecutor] global executor explicitly.\n- **priority**: The priority of the operation task. Omit this parameter or pass `nil` to inherit the enclosing context’s base priority.\n- **operation**: The operation to perform.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA reference to the task.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the `operation` throws an error, it is caught by the `Task` and will be rethrown only when the task’s `value` is awaited.
