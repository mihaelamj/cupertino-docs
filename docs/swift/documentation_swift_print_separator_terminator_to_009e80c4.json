The default is a single space (`\" \"`).\n- **terminator**: The string to print after all items have been printed. The default is a newline (`\"\\n\"`).\n- **output**: An output stream to receive the text representation of each item.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou can pass zero or more items to the `print(_:separator:terminator:to:)` function. The textual representation for each item is the same as that obtained by calling `String(describing: item)`.
