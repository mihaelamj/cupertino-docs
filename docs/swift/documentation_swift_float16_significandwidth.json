The value of `significandWidth` is always -1 or between zero and `significandBitCount`. For example:\n\n- For any representable power of two, `significandWidth` is zero, because `significand` is `1.0`.\n- If `x` is 10, `x.significand` is `1.01` in binary, so `x.significandWidth` is 2.\n- If `x` is Float.pi, `x.significand` is `1.10010010000111111011011` in binary, and `x.significandWidth` is 23.\n\n",
