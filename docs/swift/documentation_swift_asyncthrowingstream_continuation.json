You can also use the continuation’s `finish(throwing:)` method to terminate the stream by throwing an error.\n\n\n\n## Producing Elements\n\n- **yield(_:)**: Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return normally from its suspension point with a given element.\n- **yield(with:)**: Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return normally or throw, based on a given result.\n- **yield()**: Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return normally from its suspension point.\n- **AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.YieldResult**: A type that indicates the result of yielding a value to a client, by way of the continuation.\n\n## Finishing the Stream\n\n- **finish(throwing:)**: Resume the task awaiting the next iteration point by having it return nil, which signifies the end of the iteration.\n\n## Handling Termination\n\n- **onTermination**: A callback to invoke when canceling iteration of an asynchronous stream.\n- **AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.Termination**: A type that indicates how the stream terminated.\n\n## Enumerations\n\n- **AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.BufferingPolicy**: A strategy that handles exhaustion of a buffer’s capacity.\n\n## Default Implementations\n\n- **Equatable Implementations**\n- **Hashable Implementations**\n\n## Creating a Continuation-Based Stream\n\n- **init(_:bufferingPolicy:_:)**: Constructs an asynchronous stream for an element type, using the specified buffering policy and element-producing closure.\n- **AsyncThrowingStream.Continuation.BufferingPolicy**: A strategy that handles exhaustion of a buffer’s capacity.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- Copyable\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
