The same state is passed to all invocations of `next`, so subsequent calls will see any mutations made by previous calls. The sequence ends when `next` returns `nil`. If `next` never returns `nil`, the sequence is infinite.\n\nThis function can be used to replace many instances of `AnyIterator` that wrap a closure.\n\nExample:",
