The `children` collection of the resulting mirror may be upgraded to a random access collection later. See the `children` property for details.\n- **displayStyle**: The preferred display style for the mirror when presented in the debugger or in a playground. The default is `nil`.\n- **ancestorRepresentation**: The means of generating the subject’s ancestor representation. `ancestorRepresentation` is ignored if `subject` is not a class instance. The default is `.generated`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou use this initializer from within your type’s `customMirror` implementation to create a customized mirror.
