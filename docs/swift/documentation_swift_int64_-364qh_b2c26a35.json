If you use `2` as the right-hand-side value in an operation on `x`, the value is shifted right by two bits.\n\nIf you use `11` as `rhs`, `x` is overshifted such that all of its bits are set to zero.\n\nUsing a negative value as `rhs` is the same as performing a left shift using `abs(rhs)`.\n\nRight shift operations on negative values “fill in” the high bits with ones instead of zeros.",

An overshift results in `-1` for a negative value of `lhs` or `0` for a nonnegative value.\n- Using any other value for `rhs` performs a right shift on `lhs` by that amount.\n\nThe following example defines `x` as an instance of `UInt8`, an 8-bit, unsigned integer type.
