Pass `nil` to use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/Task\/basePriority] of the current task (if there is one).\n- **taskExecutor**: The task executor that the child task should be started on and keep using. Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to no preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/globalConcurrentExecutor] global executor explicitly.\n- **operation**: The operation to be run immediately upon entering the task.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA reference to the unstructured task which may be awaited on.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function *starts* the created task on the calling context. The task will continue executing on the caller’s context until it suspends, and after suspension will resume on the adequate executor. For a nonisolated operation this means running on the global concurrent pool, and on an isolated operation it means the appropriate executor of that isolation context.\n\nAs indicated by the lack of `async` on this method, this method does *not* suspend, and instead takes over the calling task’s (thread’s) execution in a synchronous manner.\n\nOther than the execution semantics discussed above, the created task is semantically equivalent to a task created using the `Task\/init` initializer.\n\n## Creating a Task that Starts Immediately\n\n- **immediate(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:)**: Create and immediately start running a new detached task in the context of the calling thread\/task.\n- **immediateDetached(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:)**: Create and immediately start running a new task in the context of the calling thread\/task.\n- **immediateDetached(name:priority:executorPreference:operation:)**: Create and immediately start running a new task in the context of the calling thread\/task.\n\n",
