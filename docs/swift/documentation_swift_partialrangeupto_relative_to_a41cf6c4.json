  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA range suitable for slicing `collection`. The returned range is *not* guaranteed to be inside the bounds of `collection`. Callers should apply the same preconditions to the return value as they would to a range provided directly by the user.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou can use the `relative(to:)` method to convert a range expression, which could be missing one or both of its endpoints, into a concrete range that is bounded on both sides. The following example uses this method to convert a partial range up to `4` into a half-open range, using an array instance to add the range’s lower bound.\n\nThe `r1` range is bounded on the lower end by `0` because that is the starting index of the `numbers` array. When the collection passed to `relative(to:)` starts with a different index, that index is used as the lower bound instead. The next example creates a slice of `numbers` starting at index `2`, and then uses the slice with `relative(to:)` to convert `upToFour` to a concrete range.\n\nUse this method only if you need the concrete range it produces. To access a slice of a collection using a range expression, use the collection’s generic subscript that uses a range expression as its parameter.",
