The `nextPartialResult` closure receives `initialResult` the first time the closure executes.\n- **updateAccumulatingResult**: A closure that combines an accumulating value and an element of the asynchronous sequence into a new accumulating value, for use in the next call of the `nextPartialResult` closure or returned to the caller.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe final accumulated value. If the sequence has no elements, the result is `initialResult`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse the `reduce(into:_:)` method to produce a single value from the elements of an entire sequence.
