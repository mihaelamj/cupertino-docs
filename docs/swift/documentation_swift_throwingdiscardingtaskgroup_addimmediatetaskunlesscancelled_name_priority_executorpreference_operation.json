Omit this parameter or pass `nil` to inherit the task group’s base priority.\n- **taskExecutor**: The task executor that the child task should be started on and keep using. Explicitly passing `nil` as the executor preference is equivalent to calling the `addImmediateTaskUnlessCancelled` method without a preference, and effectively means to inherit the outer context’s executor preference. You can also pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Swift\/globalConcurrentExecutor] global executor explicitly.\n- **operation**: The operation to execute as part of the task group.\n\n## Return Value\n\n`true` if the child task was added to the group; otherwise `false`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function *starts* the created task on the calling context. The task will continue executing on the caller’s context until it suspends, and after suspension will resume on the adequate executor. For a nonisolated operation this means running on the global concurrent pool, and on an isolated operation it means the appropriate executor of that isolation context.\n\nAs indicated by the lack of `async` on this method, this method does *not* suspend, and instead takes over the calling task’s (thread’s) execution in a synchronous manner.\n\nOther than the execution semantics discussed above, the created task is semantically equivalent to its basic version which can be created using `ThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup\/addTask`.\n\n",
