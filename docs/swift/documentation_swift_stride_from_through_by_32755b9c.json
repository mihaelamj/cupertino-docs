If the sequence contains any values, the first one is `start`.\n- **end**: An end value to limit the sequence. `end` is an element of the resulting sequence if and only if it can be produced from `start` using steps of `stride`.\n- **stride**: The amount to step by with each iteration. A positive `stride` iterates upward; a negative `stride` iterates downward.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA sequence from `start` toward, and possibly including, `end`.
