If `maxSplits + 1` subsequences are returned, the last one is a suffix of the original sequence containing the remaining elements. `maxSplits` must be greater than or equal to zero. The default value is `Int.max`.\n- **omittingEmptySubsequences**: If `false`, an empty subsequence is returned in the result for each consecutive pair of `separator` elements in the sequence and for each instance of `separator` at the start or end of the sequence. If `true`, only nonempty subsequences are returned. The default value is `true`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn array of subsequences, split from this sequence’s elements.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe resulting array consists of at most `maxSplits + 1` subsequences. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.\n\nThe following examples show the effects of the `maxSplits` and `omittingEmptySubsequences` parameters when splitting a string at each space character (” “). The first use of `split` returns each word that was originally separated by one or more spaces.\n\n```swift\nlet line = \"BLANCHE:   I don't want realism. I want magic!\"\nprint(line.split(separator: \" \")\n          .map(String.init))\n\/\/ Prints \"[\"BLANCHE:\", \"I\", \"don\\'t\", \"want\", \"realism.\", \"I\", \"want\", \"magic!\"]\"\n```\n\nThe second example passes `1` for the `maxSplits` parameter, so the original string is split just once, into two new strings.\n\n```swift\nprint(line.split(separator: \" \", maxSplits: 1)\n          .map(String.init))\n\/\/ Prints \"[\"BLANCHE:\", \"  I don\\'t want realism.

Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.\n- **joined()**: Returns the elements of this sequence of sequences, concatenated.\n- **joined(separator:)**: Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence, adding the given separator between each element.\n- **joined(separator:)**: Returns the concatenated elements of this sequence of sequences, inserting the given separator between each element.\n\n",
