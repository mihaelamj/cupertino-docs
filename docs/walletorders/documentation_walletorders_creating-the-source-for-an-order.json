  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn order is a self-contained package that represents a purchase a user makes, and the current state of any fulfillments and tracking metadata. The source for your order includes all the information the system needs to show it to the user, such as:\n\nCreate the source in a directory that you use to create the final distributable order package. For information about building the order package and donating to Wallet, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.walletorders\/documentation\/WalletOrders\/building-a-distributable-order-package].\n\n### Create the directory and add files and images\n\nCreate a directory to hold all the source files. Add the `order.json` file that contains the information and metadata for the order. For more information about the contents of this file, see the top-level [doc:\/\/com.apple.walletorders\/documentation\/WalletOrders\/Order] object.\n\nCreate a visually rich order by providing product images of line items and a merchant logo to represent your company or brand. The system displays product images in notifications, including on the Lock Screen, when you publish relevant updates to the order.\n\n### Add localization\n\nYou can expand your audience by localizing the strings and images of your order for different languages and regions. Add a directory at the top-level source directory of each order for each localization. The name of the directory identifies the language and an optional region.\n\nFor example, the name for the French localization directory is `fr.lproj`, and the name for the Simplified Chinese directory is `zh-Hans.lproj`. For more information about language identifiers, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/choosing-localization-regions-and-scripts].\n\nLocalize an image by adding the location-specific image files to each localization directory. For example, to add localized versions of a merchant logo, add the English version of `logo@2x.png` and `logo@3x.png` files to the `en.lprojfolder`, and the Simplified Chinese version of the `logo@2x.png` and `logo@3x.png` files to the `zh-Hans.lproj` folder. Reference your image in the `order.json` by the filename `logo`. Be sure to provide the same number of resolutions for each localization.\n\n### Localize the strings\n\nThe system localizes the strings in your order using a strings file that contains a list of keys and associated localized strings. For more information about fields that are localizable, see the top-level [doc:\/\/com.apple.walletorders\/documentation\/WalletOrders\/Order] object.\n\nAdd localized strings to your order using the following steps:\n\nFor example, to localize a line item from English to German, set the value of the strings in the `order.json` to keys.\n\nDefine the values for the keys in the English strings in `en.lproj\/order.strings`.\n\nThen define the values for the keys in the German strings in `de.lproj\/order.strings`.\n\nThe system localizes fields that contain dates and times that use standard formats in the `order.json` file. The system always displays localized versions of these values, even when your order doesn’t contain localization folders for the language.",

Set the value of a displayed string in `order.json` to a key, such as `LineItemTitle` for the title of a line item.\n2. Add an `order.strings` file to the localization folder.\n3. Add a line to each `order.strings` file that sets a key you create in `order.json` to the localized term.\n\nFor example, to localize a line item from English to German, set the value of the strings in the `order.json` to keys.\n\n```other\n...  \n\"lineItems\": [\n    {\n        \"title\": \"LineItemTitle\", \n        \"subtitle\": \"LineItemSubtitle\",\n        \"quantity\": \"2\" \n    }\n]\n...\n```\n\nDefine the values for the keys in the English strings in `en.lproj\/order.strings`.\n\n```other\n\/* English Localization *\/\n\"LineItemTitle\" = \"Water Bowl\";\n\"LineItemSubtitle\" = \"Green\";\n```\n\nThen define the values for the keys in the German strings in `de.lproj\/order.strings`.\n\n```other\n\/* German Localization *\/\n\"LineItemTitle\" = \"Wasserschale\";\n\"LineItemSubtitle\" = \"Grün\";\n```\n\n\n\nThe system localizes fields that contain dates and times that use standard formats in the `order.json` file. The system always displays localized versions of these values, even when your order doesn’t contain localization folders for the language.\n\n\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Building a distributable order package**: Prepare an order for distribution by building, signing, and compressing the source files.\n- **Retrieve the registrations for a device**: Retrieves the identifiers of the orders that the device registered for.\n- **Retrieve the latest version of an order**: Retrieves the latest signed and compressed version of an order.\n- **Order**: The order’s details, including information about the products or services rendered, customer service, and fulfillment.\n- **Example Order Packages**: Edit, build, and add example order packages to Wallet.\n\n",
