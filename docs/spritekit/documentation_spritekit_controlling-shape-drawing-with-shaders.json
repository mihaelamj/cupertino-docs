  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen you want to go beyond the effects provided by a shape node’s properties, you can take full control of its stroking or filling by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKShapeNode\/strokeShader] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKShapeNode\/fillShader] properties, respectively. To do that, you supply custom OpenGL ES shader code embedded within a [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKShader] object. Custom shaders allow you to create custom effects, such as dashed lines and gradient strokes, and custom fills, such as checkerboards and random patterns.\n\n### Customize a Shape Node’s Stroke\n\nShape nodes have two additional stroke-related properties that extend the properties defined by [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKShader]:\n\nBy dividing the distance along the path by the total length of the path, you get the normalized position (between `0` and `1`) of each point along a shape node’s path and use it to construct the color of each pixel along the shape node’s stroke. The following code shows how you create a custom shader to do this:\n\nThe generated shape node looks like this:\n\n\n\nAlternatively, by casting both symbols to integers and using the modulo operator, you get the same shape node with a shader that generates a dashed line, as shown in the following code:\n\nThe generated shape node looks like this:\n\n\n\n### Customize a Shape Node’s Fill\n\nYou create a custom fill for a shape node by writing shader code and embedding it within an [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKShader] object. Assigning the shader to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKShapeNode\/fillShader] property overrides the appearance that would otherwise be defined by [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKShapeNode\/fillColor] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKShapeNode\/fillTexture].\n\nThe following shader code demonstrates filling a shape node with a simple checkerboard texture. Inside the shader, the variables `h` and `v` would, on their own, form horizontal and vertical stripes. The exclusive or operator, `^`, creates the checkerboard pattern from those stripes.\n\nThe generated shape node looks like this:\n\n",
