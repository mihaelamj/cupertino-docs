More complex shapes require more work to be properly simulated. For volume-based bodies, use the following guidelines:\n\n- A circle is the most efficient shape ([doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody\/init(circleOfRadius:)])\n- A path-based polygon is the least efficient shape, and the computational work scales with the complexity of the polygon ([doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody\/init(polygonFrom:)])\n\n### Use Edge-Based Physics Bodies Only When Needed\n\nAn edge-based body is more expensive to compute than a volume-based body. This is because the bodies it interacts with can potentially be on either side of an open edge or on the inside or outside of a closed shape. Use these guidelines:\n\n- Lines and rectangles are the most efficient edge-based bodies ([doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody\/init(edgeFrom:to:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody\/init(edgeLoopFrom:)-8sqfy])\n- Edge loops and edge chains are the most expensive edge-based bodies, and the computational work scales with the complexity of the path ([doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody\/init(edgeLoopFrom:)-5grxu] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody\/init(edgeChainFrom:)]).\n\n## Creating a Body from a Texture\n\n- **init(texture:size:)**: Creates a physics body from the contents of a texture.\n- **init(texture:alphaThreshold:size:)**: Creates a physics body from the contents of a texture, capturing only the texels that exceed a specified transparency value.\n\n",
