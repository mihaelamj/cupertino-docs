This parameter should be a value between `0.0` and `1.0`, where `1.0` represents a uniform smoothness.\n- **speed**: The speed at which the noise field should change. A value of `0.0` means that the field should not animate at all.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new noise field node.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse a noise field to simulate effects such as fireflies or snow.\n\nThe acceleration is proportional to the field strength in a pseudo-random direction. The calculated force is proportional to the physics body’s mass (meaning that the acceleration applied to all affected physics bodies is a constant).\n\n## Creating Field Nodes\n\n- **dragField()**: Creates a field node that applies a force that resists the motion of physics bodies.\n- **electricField()**: Creates a field node that applies an electrical force proportional to the electrical charge of physics bodies.\n- **linearGravityField(withVector:)**: Creates a field node that accelerates physics bodies in a specific direction.\n- **magneticField()**: Creates a field node that applies a magnetic force based on the velocity and electrical charge of the physics bodies.\n- **radialGravityField()**: Creates a field node that accelerates physics bodies toward the field node.\n- **springField()**: Creates a field node that applies a spring-like force that pulls physics bodies toward the field node.\n- **turbulenceField(withSmoothness:animationSpeed:)**: Creates a field node that applies a randomized acceleration to physics bodies.\n- **velocityField(with:)**: Creates a field node that sets the velocity of physics bodies that enter the node’s area based on the pixel values of a texture.\n- **velocityField(withVector:)**: Creates a field node that gives physics bodies a constant velocity.\n- **vortexField()**: Creates a field node that applies a perpendicular force to physics bodies.\n- **customField(evaluationBlock:)**: Creates a field node that calculates and applies a custom force to the physics body.\n- **SKFieldForceEvaluator**: The definition for a custom block that processes a single physics body’s interaction with the field.\n\n",
