However, many `SKNode` subclasses render visual content and so the `SKNode` class understands some visual concepts:\n\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/frame] property provides the bounding rectangle for a node’s visual content, modified by the scale and rotation properties. The frame is nonempty if the node’s class draws content. Each node subclass determines the size of this content differently. In some subclasses, the size of the node’s content is declared explicitly, such as in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKSpriteNode] class. In other subclasses, the content size is calculated implicitly by the class using other object properties. For example, an [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKLabelNode] object determines its content size using the label’s message text and font characteristics.\n- A node’s accumulated frame, retrieved by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/calculateAccumulatedFrame()] method, is the largest rectangle that includes the frame of the node and the frames of all its descendants.\n- Other properties, such as the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/alpha] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/isHidden] properties, affect how the node and its descendants are drawn.\n\nAll nodes are responder objects that can respond directly to user interaction with the node onscreen. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/controlling-user-interaction-on-nodes]. You can also convert between coordinate systems and perform hit testing to determine which nodes a point lies in, and perform intersections between nodes in the tree to determine if their physical areas overlap.\n\nAny node in the tree may run **actions**, which are used to animate the properties of a node, add or remove nodes, play sounds, or perform other custom tasks.

If you are performing other work in the background, you should adopt an approach similar to\n\nListing 1. Manipulating a node within a scene update callback\n\n```swift\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    let queue = DispatchQueue.global()\n    \n    var makeNodeModifications = false\n    \n    func backgroundComputation() {\n        queue.async {\n            \/\/ Perform background calculations but do not modify \n            \/\/ SpriteKit objects\n            \n            \/\/ Set a flag for later modification within the \n            \/\/ SKScene or SKSceneDelegate callback of your choosing\n            \n            self.makeNodeModifications = true\n        }\n    }\n}\nextension ViewController: SKSceneDelegate {\n    func update(_ currentTime: TimeInterval, for scene: SKScene) {\n        if makeNodeModifications {\n            makeNodeModifications = false\n            \n            \/\/ Make node modifications\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Lay Out Your Scene with Basic Nodes\n\nEven though `SKNode` objects cannot directly draw content, there are useful ways to use them in your app. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n- You have content that is built up from multiple node objects, either sprites or other content nodes. However, you want this content to be thought of as a single object within your game, without promoting any one of the content nodes to be the root. A basic node is appropriate, because you can give it a position in the scene tree and then make all of the other nodes its descendants. These individual pieces can also be moved or adjusted relative to the parent’s location.\n- You want to organize your drawn content into a series of layers. For example, many games have a background layer for the world, another layer for characters, and a third layer for text and other game information. Other games have many more layers. Create the layers as basic nodes, and insert them into the scene in order. Then, as necessary, you can make individual layers visible or invisible.\n- You need an object in the scene that is invisible but that performs some other necessary function. For example, in a dungeon-exploring game, an invisible node might be used to represent a hidden trap. When another node intersects it, the trap is triggered. For another example, you might add a node as a child of another node that represents the position of the player’s point of view.\n\nThere are advantages to having a node in the tree to represent these concepts:\n\n- You can add or remove entire subtrees by adding or removing a single node. This makes scene management efficient.\n- You can adjust properties of a node in the tree and have the effects of those properties propagate down to the node’s descendants. For example, if the basic node has sprite nodes as its children, rotating the basic node also rotates all of the sprite content.\n- You can take advantage of actions, physics contacts, and other SpriteKit features to implement the concept.\n\n## First Steps\n\n- **init()**: Initializes a blank node.\n- **init(fileNamed:)**: Creates a new node by loading an archive file from the game’s main bundle.\n- **init(coder:)**: Called when a node is initialized from an .sks file.\n- **init(fileNamed:securelyWithClasses:)**\n\n",
