Second, it must prepare the texture data to be used by the graphics hardware. Both of these steps can be expensive compared to other SpriteKit operations. In particular, loading a texture from a file is very expensive. SpriteKit defers loading and preparing the texture as long as possible and provides methods you can use to control these steps.\n\nThe texture data is loaded when:\n\nThe texture data is prepared for rendering when a sprite or particle that uses the texture is part of a node tree that is being rendered.
