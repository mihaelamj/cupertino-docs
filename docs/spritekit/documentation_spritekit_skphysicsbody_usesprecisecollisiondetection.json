  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nWhen SpriteKit performs collision detection, it first determines the locations of all of the physics bodies in the scene. Then it determines whether collisions or contacts occurred. This computational method is fast, but can sometimes result in missed collisions. A small body might move so fast that it completely passes through another physics body without ever having a frame of animation where the two touch each other.\n\nIf you have physics bodies that must collide, you can hint to SpriteKit to use a more precise collision model to check for interactions. This model is more expensive, so it should be used sparingly. When either body uses precise collisions, multiple contact iterations are evaluated to ensure that all contacts are detected.\n\nThe default value is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false]. If two bodies in a collision do not perform precise collision detection, and one passes completely through the other in a single frame, no collision is detected. If this property is set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] on either body, the simulation performs a more precise and more expensive calculation to detect these collisions. This property should be set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] on small, fast moving bodies.",
