For example, you might need to:\n\n- Discover whether a physics body is located in a region of the scene.\n- Detect when a physics body (such as the one controlled by the player) crosses a particular line.\n- Trace the line of sight between two physics bodies, to see whether another physics body, such as a wall, is interposed between the two objects.\n- Occlude an audio node if a body is between it and a scene’s listener node.\n\nIn some cases, you can implement these interactions using the collisions and contacts system. For example, to discover when a physics body enters a region, you could create a physics body and attach it to an invisible node in the scene. Then, configure the physics body’s collision mask so that it never collides with anything, and its contact mask to detect the physics bodies you are interested in.
