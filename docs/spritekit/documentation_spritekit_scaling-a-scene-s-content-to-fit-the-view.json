In macOS, `scaleMode` affects how your scene is scaled when the user changes the size or proportions of your app’s window.\n\n### Decide Which Scale Mode Is Best\n\nWhen you design your game, you should decide on a strategy for handling the scene’s `size` and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKScene\/scaleMode] properties.

Here are the most common strategies:\n\n- Instantiate the scene with a constant size and never change it. Pick a scaling mode that lets the view scale the scene’s content. This gives the scene a predictable coordinate system and frame. You can then base your art assets and gameplay logic on this coordinate system.\n- Adjust the size of the scene in your game. Where necessary, adjust your game logic and art assets to match the scene’s size.\n- Set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKScene\/scaleMode] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKSceneScaleMode\/resizeFill]. SpriteKit automatically resizes the scene so that it always matches the view’s size. Where necessary, adjust your game logic and art assets to match the scene’s size.\n\n### Set a Fixed Aspect Ratio\n\nListing 1 shows a typical implementation for when you plan to use a constant-sized scene.
