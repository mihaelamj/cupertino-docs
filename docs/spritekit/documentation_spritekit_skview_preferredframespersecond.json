The actual frame rate chosen is usually a factor of the maximum refresh rate of the screen to provide a consistent frame rate. For example, if the maximum refresh rate of the screen is 60 frames per second, that is also the highest frame rate the view sets as the actual frame rate. However, if you ask for a lower frame rate, the view might choose 30, 20, or 15 frames per second, or another rate, as the actual frame rate.\n\nYour application should choose a frame rate that it can consistently maintain.\n\nThe default value is 60 frames per second.",
