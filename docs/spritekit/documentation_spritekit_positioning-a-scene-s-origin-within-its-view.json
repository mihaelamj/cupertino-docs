For example, setting the scene’s `anchorPoint` to `(0,0)` makes child nodes with a position of `(0,0)` display at the bottom-left corner of the scene. However, setting the scene’s `anchorPoint` to `(0.5,0.5)` makes child nodes with a position of `(0,0)` display in the center of the scene.\n\nYou only use the scene’s `anchorPoint` for scene’s that don’t have a [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKScene\/camera]. If, however, you set a scene’s `camera`, then the camera drives which portion of the scene is visible at any given time, and the `anchorPoint` is ignored.\n\n### Set the Scene’s Origin to the Bottom-Left of its View\n\nBy default, a scene’s origin is placed in the lower-left corner of the view, as shown in the figure below. A scene initialized with a height of `1024` and a width of `768` has the origin `(0,0)` in the lower-left corner, and the `(1024,768)` coordinate in the upper-right corner. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/frame] property holds `(0,0)-(1024,768)`.\n\nA scene’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/position] property is ignored by Scene Kit because the scene is always the root node for a node tree. Its default value is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGPoint\/zero] and you can’t change it. However, you can move the scene’s origin by setting its [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKScene\/anchorPoint] property. The anchor point is specified in the unit coordinate space and chooses a point in the enclosing view.\n\n\n\nThe default value for the anchor point is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGPoint\/zero], which places it at the lower-left corner. The scene’s visible coordinate space is `(0,0)` to `(width,height)`. The default anchor point is most useful for games that do not scroll a scene’s content.\n\n### Center the Scene’s Origin Within its View\n\nThe second-most common anchor point value is `(0.5,0.5)`, which centers the scene’s origin in the middle of the view as shown in the figure below. The scene’s visible coordinate space is `(-width\/2,-height\/2)` to `(width\/2,height\/2)`. Centering the scene on its anchor point is most useful when you want to easily position nodes relative to the center of the screen, such as in a scrolling game. However, this effect is better achieved using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKCameraNode].\n\n\n\nAs a result of setting the `anchorPoint` and `size`, you indirectly set the scene’s frame, which determines the portion of the scene that’s visible to the user.",
