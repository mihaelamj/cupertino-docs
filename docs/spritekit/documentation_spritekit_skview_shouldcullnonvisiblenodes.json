Then the remaining (visible) nodes are processed and rendered. This is normally the desired behavior, because Scene Kit avoids expensive processing on nodes that cannot affect the final output. However, if your game is already managing the contents of the scene’s node tree (for example, by removing nodes from the tree when they are offscreen), you can set this to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] to disable automatic scene culling. Disabling scene culling removes the performance overhead of this check, but each invisible or offscreen node present in the node tree reduces the performance of the renderer.",
