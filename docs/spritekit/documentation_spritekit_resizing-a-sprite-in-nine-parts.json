When a sprite is initialized using [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKSpriteNode\/init(imageNamed:)], the value of this property is initialized to be equal to the size of the supplied image.\n- The base size is then scaled by the sprite’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/xScale] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/yScale] properties inherited from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode] class.\n\nFor example, if the sprite node’s base size is 32 x 32 pixels and it has an [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/xScale] value of 1.0 and a [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/yScale] value of 2.0, the size of its frame is 32 x 64 pixels.\n\n\n\nWhen a sprite node’s frame is larger than its texture, the texture is stretched to cover its frame.

The default value is a rectangle that covers the entire texture, which is why the entire texture is stretched across the frame. If you specify a rectangle that only covers a portion of the texture, you create a 3 x 3 grid. Each box in the grid has its own scaling behavior:\n\n- The portions of the texture in the four corners of the grid are drawn without any scaling.\n- The center of the grid is scaled in both dimensions.\n- The upper- and lower-middle parts are only scaled horizontally.\n- The left- and right-middle parts are only scaled vertically.\n\nThe following figure shows a close-up view of a texture you might use to draw a user interface button. The complete texture is 28 x 28 pixels. The corner pieces are each 12 x 12 pixels and the center is 4 x 4 pixels.\n\n\n\nThe following code shows how this button sprite would be initialized.
