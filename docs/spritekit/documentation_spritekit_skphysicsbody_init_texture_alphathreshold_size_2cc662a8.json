A new physics body is created that includes all of the texels in the texture whose alpha values equal or exceed the `alphaThreshold` parameter. The shape of this body attempts to strike a good balance between performance and accuracy. For example, fine details may be ignored if keeping them would cause a significant performance penalty.",
