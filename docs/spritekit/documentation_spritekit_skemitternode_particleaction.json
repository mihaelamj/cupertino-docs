Whenever a new particle is created, the emitter tells the particle to run that action. You can use actions to create very sophisticated behaviors.\n\nFor the purpose of using actions on particles, you can treat the particle as if it were a normal node. This means you can perform other interesting tricks, such as animating the particle’s textures.",
