The body must be connected to a node that is already part of the scene’s node tree.\n- **bodyB**: The second body to connect. The body must be connected to a node that is already part of the scene’s node tree.\n- **anchor**: The anchor point for the connection in the scene’s coordinate system.\n- **axis**: A vector that defines the direction that the joint is allowed to slide.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new sliding joint.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou must add the joint to a physics world associated with the scene before it takes effect.\n\n",
