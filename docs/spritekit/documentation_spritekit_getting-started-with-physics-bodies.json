When the scene simulates physics, it performs the calculations for all physics bodies connected to the scene tree. So, you create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody] object, configure its properties, and then assign it to a node’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/physicsBody] property.\n\nThere are three kinds of physics bodies:\n\n- A *dynamic volume* simulates a physical object with volume and mass that can be affected by forces and collisions in the system. Use dynamic volumes to represent items in the scene that need to move around and collide with each other.\n- A *static volume* is similar to a dynamic volume, but its velocity is ignored and it is unaffected by forces or collisions. However, because it still has volume, other objects can bounce off it or interact with it. Use static volumes to represent items that take up space in the scene, but that should not be moved by the simulation. For example, you might use static volumes to represent the walls of a maze. While it is useful to think of static and dynamic volumes as distinct entities, in practice these are two different modes you can apply to any volume-based physics body. This can be useful because you can selectively enable or disable effects for a body.\n- An *edge* is a static volume-less body. Edges are never moved by the simulation and their mass doesn’t matter. Edges are used to represent negative space within a scene (such as a hollow spot inside another entity) or an uncrossable, invisibly thin boundary. For example, edges are frequently used to represent the boundaries of your scene. The main difference between an edge and a volume is that an edge permits movement inside its own boundaries, while a volume is considered a solid object. If edges are moved through other means, they only interact with volumes, not with other edges.\n\nSpriteKit provides a few standard shapes—those based on arbitrary paths and those generated from the alpha channel of a texture. The following figure shows the shapes available:\n\n\n\nThe following code shows how to generate the four physics bodies called out above:\n\n```swift\nlet spaceShipTexture = SKTexture(imageNamed: \"spaceShip.png\")\n   \n\/\/ Spaceship 1: circular physics body\nlet circularSpaceShip = SKSpriteNode(texture: spaceShipTexture)\ncircularSpaceShip.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: max(circularSpaceShip.size.width \/ 2,\n                                                                  circularSpaceShip.size.height \/ 2))\n   \n\/\/ Spaceship 2: rectangular physics body\nlet rectangularSpaceShip = SKSpriteNode(texture: spaceShipTexture)\nrectangularSpaceShip.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(rectangleOf: CGSize(width: circularSpaceShip.size.width,\n                                                                     height: circularSpaceShip.size.height))\n   \n\/\/ Spaceship 3: polygonal physics body\nlet polygonalSpaceShip = SKSpriteNode(texture: spaceShipTexture)\nlet path = CGMutablePath()\npath.addLines(between: [CGPoint(x: -5, y: 37), CGPoint(x: 5, y: 37), CGPoint(x: 10, y: 20),\n                        CGPoint(x: 56, y: -5), CGPoint(x: 37, y: -35), CGPoint(x: 15, y: -30),\n                        CGPoint(x: 12, y: -37), CGPoint(x: -12, y: -37), CGPoint(x: -15, y: -30),\n                        CGPoint(x: -37, y: -35), CGPoint(x: -56, y: -5), CGPoint(x: -10, y: 20),\n                        CGPoint(x: -5, y: 37)])\npath.closeSubpath()\npolygonalSpaceShip.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(polygonFrom: path)\n  \n\/\/ Spaceship 4: physics body using texture’s alpha channel\nlet texturedSpaceShip = SKSpriteNode(texture: spaceShipTexture)\ntexturedSpaceShip.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: spaceShipTexture,\n                                              size: CGSize(width: circularSpaceShip.size.width,\n                                                           height: circularSpaceShip.size.height))\n```\n\nThe shape of a physics body affects performance. A circular physics body offers the best performance and can be significantly faster than other physics bodies. If your simulation contains many physics bodies, circular bodies are the best solution.
