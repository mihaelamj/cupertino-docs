These atlases are compiled and installed inside the app bundle. However, sometimes the assets needed to create a texture atlas are not available at compile time. For example, those assets might be procedurally generated or downloaded from the network. However, you still want the benefit of texture atlases to reduce the number of state changes required in the hardware. You can use this method to generate an atlas object at runtime. This is a potentially expensive operation best performed when your game loop is not running.\n\nThe keys in the dictionary represent the names of the individual textures. The associated object for each key can be:",
