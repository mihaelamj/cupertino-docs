If you need to see whether a particular action is executing, or if you want to remove a specific action, use named actions. A named action is characterized by a unique string that identifies the action. Using named actions, you can start, remove, find and replace the actions of a node.\n\n### Create and Run a Named Action\n\nThe following code creates and runs a new action identified with the `ignition` key.\n\nThe following key-based methods are available:\n\n### Find and Replace an In-Flight Action\n\nThe code below shows how you use a name to replace an action that’s currently running. The code determines where a mouse click occurred and then runs an action that moves a sprite to the click location. The action duration is calculated ahead of time to move the sprite at a fixed speed. Because this code uses [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/run(_:withKey:)], any previous move that’s still executing is stopped and replaced by the new action with the same name.",
