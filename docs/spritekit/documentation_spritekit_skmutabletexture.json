This is important because a static image can be more efficiently managed inside the graphics hardware. However, sometimes you need to be able to update the contents of a texture dynamically. In this case, you should use a mutable texture. Because there is a performance penalty for updating the texture’s contents, consider other options first. For example, you can render a texture in hardware using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKView\/texture(from:)] method and a node tree.\n\nTo use this class, create a mutable texture using either one of its creation methods or those of its superclass. Then, when you need to update the mutable texture object’s contents, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKMutableTexture\/modifyPixelData(_:)] method. Your block is called with the location of the texture in memory. Your block should update this texture and then return.",
