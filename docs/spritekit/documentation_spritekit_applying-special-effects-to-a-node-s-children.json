The effect node accumulates the effects of these lights, applies a blur filter to soften the resulting image, and uses a multiply blend mode to apply this lighting to a texture.\n\n\n\n\n\nHereʼs how the scene generates this lighting effect:\n\n1. The scene has two children. The first is a textured sprite that represents the ground. The second is an effect node to apply lighting.\n2. The effect nodeʼs children are sprite nodes rendered using an additive blend mode.\n3. The effect node includes a filter effect to soften the lighting.\n4. The effect node uses a multiplication blend mode to apply its lighting effect to the sceneʼs framebuffer.\n\nThe following Swift code demonstrates an implementation of this technique:\n\n```swift\nlet lightingNode = SKEffectNode()\n\nlet light = SKSpriteNode(texture: lightTexture)\nlight.blendMode = .add\n...\nlightingNode.addChild(light)\n\nlet blurFilter = CIFilter(name: \"CIBoxBlur\",\nwithInputParameters: [\"inputRadius\": 20])\n\nlightingNode.filter = blurFilter\n\nlightingNode.blendMode = .multiply\n```\n\n## Applying Core Image Filters with an Effect Node\n\n- **filter**: The Core Image filter to apply.\n- **shouldEnableEffects**: A Boolean value that determines whether the effect node applies the filter to its children as they are drawn.\n- **shouldCenterFilter**: A Boolean value that determines whether the effect node automatically sets the filter’s image center.\n\n",
