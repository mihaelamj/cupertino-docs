The methods in this protocol all correspond to methods implemented by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKScene] class. If the delegate implements a particular method, that method is called instead of the corresponding method on the scene object.\n\nWhen processing a scene, SpriteKit runs a loop that processes and renders the scene. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKSceneDelegate] methods allows you to add logic at any step of the loop.\n\n",
