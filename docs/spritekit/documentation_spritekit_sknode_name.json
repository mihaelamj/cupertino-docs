You can also search for nodes in a tree by their name.\n\nWhen choosing a name for a node, decide whether each node gets a unique name or whether some nodes will share a common name. If you give the node a unique name, you can find the node later by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/childNode(withName:)] method. If a name is shared by multiple nodes, the name usually means that these are all a similar object type in your game. In this case, you can iterate over those objects by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/enumerateChildNodes(withName:using:)] method.",
