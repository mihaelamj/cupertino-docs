  "overview" : "## Overview\n\n`SKNode` subclasses [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder] in iOS and tvOS, and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSResponder] in macOS, allowing nodes to respond to user interaction events such as touches and mouse movements.\n\nThere are two strategies you can adopt when supporting user interaction.\n\n### Catch All User Interaction by Using a Parent Node\n\nListing 1 shows an example of how to handle all user interaction on a parent node–in this case, the scene itself. The `TouchScene` class subclasses [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKScene] and overrides its [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/isUserInteractionEnabled] to return `true`.\n\nListing 1. A scene that responds to touches\n\nThe overridden [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesBegan(_:with:)] method shows two techniques to find the nodes that have been touched. [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/nodes(at:)] returns an array of all of the sprites and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/atPoint(_:)] returns the top-most touched node.\n\nIn this example, the child nodes should have [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/isUserInteractionEnabled] set to `false`. The parent scene is responsible for responding to user interactions.\n\nListing 2 shows the equivalent code for macOS.\n\nListing 2. A scene that responds to mouse down\n\n### Enable User Interaction on All Nodes\n\nListing 3 shows an example of supporting user interaction on individual nodes in your scene. Instances of `TouchSpriteNode` are added as children of a standard scene and user interaction is handled by each independently.\n\nIn the case of overlapping nodes, only one will register a user interaction. For example, of two overlapping nodes, the one with the highest [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/zPosition] receives the touch. For two nodes with an equal `zPosition`, the last node in the parent’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/children] array receives the touch.\n\nListing 3. A sprite node that responds to touches\n\n### Handle User Interaction on Hidden Nodes by Using Alpha\n\nTranslucent nodes–those with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/alpha] of less than `1` but greater than `0`–still receive user interactions. You can set a node’s `alpha` to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Float\/leastNonzeroMagnitude] to make it effectively transparent and yet still respond to touches or mouse movements, although giving it a color of `clear` has the same effect.\n\n### Review the Bounds of Node User Interaction\n\nUser interaction is based on the bounding box of the node. Sprite nodes containing textures with transparent areas or shape nodes with non-rectangular shapes will still report touches and mouse interactions even if the interaction is over a transparent part of their content.\n\nIf you build a composite node, the region that receives user interaction events is dependent on the node tree. Listing 4 shows the code used to create a subclassed [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode] that renders six circular shape nodes forming a larger circle.\n\nListing 4. A composite node that responds to touches\n\nIf you were to add an instance of `TouchCompositeNode` to an [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKScene] with no other nodes behind it, all touches inside its [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/calculateAccumulatedFrame()] would be reported. The figure below shows the accumulated frame of `TouchCompositeNode`. Any user events within the dashed line will call [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesBegan(_:with:)].\n\n\n\nHowever, if you were to place an instance of `TouchCompositeNode` above another node using, for example, the code in Listing 5, only touches on its child nodes would be reported.\n\nListing 5. Placing a composite node over a background\n\nIn this case, only touches or mouse events over the red spots shown in the figure below will call [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesBegan(_:with:)].\n\n",
