Nodes are either visual elements or containers of other nodes. You set up the appearance of a SpriteKit scene by adding nodes alongside and on top of each other in a hierarchical form. Collectively, this structure is referred to as the *node tree* or the *node hierarchy*.\n\nThese are the basic nonvisual nodes in SpriteKit:\n\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode] is a container node. It doesn’t render any content of its own, but works as a layout tool for its child nodes.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKReferenceNode] doesn’t define content of its own, but refers to another node or archived file that does.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKCameraNode] defines point of view within a scene. Its inverse scale is applied to all nodes in the hierarchy except for its children. Use the children of `SKCameraNode` for UI elements that should be unaffected by zoom level.\n\nFor a list of visual elements, see Nodes that Draw in [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/nodes-for-scene-building], which also includes some examples of using visual nodes.\n\n## Base Nodes\n\n- **SKNode**: The base class of all SpriteKit nodes.\n- **SKCameraNode**: A node that determines which parts of the scene are visible within a view.\n- **SKReferenceNode**: A node that’s defined in an archived `.sks` file.\n\n",
