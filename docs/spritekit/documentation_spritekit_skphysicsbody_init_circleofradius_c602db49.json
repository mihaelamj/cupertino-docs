Because the physics body is attached to a sprite object, it usually needs volume. In this case, the sprite image is assumed to closely approximate a circle centered on the anchor point, so the radius of the circle is calculated and used to create the physics body.\n\nListing 1. A physics body for a circular sprite\n\nIf the physics body were significantly smaller than the sprite’s image, the data used to create the physics body might need to be provided by some other source, such as a property list.",
