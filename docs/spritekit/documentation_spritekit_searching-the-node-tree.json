You may also be loading nodes from an archive file rather than instantiating them directly at runtime, so you may need to be able to find specific nodes within a node tree. To do this, you provide names to nodes and then search for those names.\n\nThe node name usually serves two purposes in your app:\n\n### Name Your Node\n\nA node’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/name] property should be an alphanumeric string without any punctuation. The following code shows how you might name three different nodes to distinguish them from each other.\n\nWhen you name nodes in the tree, decide whether those names will be unique. If a node’s name is unique, you should never include more than one node with that name in the scene tree. On the other hand, if a node name is not unique within your app, it might represent a collection of related nodes. For example, in the code above, there are probably multiple goblins within the game, and you might want to identify them all with the same name.

You may also be loading nodes from an archive file rather than instantiating them directly at runtime, so you may need to be able to find specific nodes within a node tree. To do this, you provide names to nodes and then search for those names.\n\nThe node name usually serves two purposes in your app:\n\n- You can write your own code that implements game logic based on the node’s name. For example, when two physics objects collide, you might use the node names to determine how the collision affects gameplay.\n- You can search for nodes that have a particular name. Typically, this is done once, when a scene is first loaded.\n\n### Name Your Node\n\nA node’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/name] property should be an alphanumeric string without any punctuation. The following code shows how you might name three different nodes to distinguish them from each other.\n\n\n\nWhen you name nodes in the tree, decide whether those names will be unique.

This method is usually used to search for nodes with unique names.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/enumerateChildNodes(withName:using:)] method searches a node’s children and calls your block once for each matching node it finds. You use this method when you want to find all nodes that share the same name.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKNode\/subscript(_:)] method returns an array of nodes that match a particular name.\n\nThe following code shows how you might create a method on your scene class to find the player node. You might use a method like this inside your code to load and prepare a scene.\n\n\n\nWhen this method is called on the scene, the scene searches its children (and only its children) for a node whose `name` property matches the search string, then returns the node.
