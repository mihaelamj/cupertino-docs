Only the `x` and `y` components of the return value are used by SpriteKit, the `z` component is ignored.\n\nThe values passed into the block by the `position` and `velocity` arguments measured in meters: if you need to convert them into points — as used by SpriteKit — multiply the values by 150.\n\nThe following code shows how to create a custom field to emulate drag. The block returns the negative of the square root of the velocity of the physics body. This decelerates a physics body passing through the [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKFieldNode] object’s region.\n\nListing 1. Creating a custom drag field",
