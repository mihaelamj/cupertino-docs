The primary callback for your game logic is [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKSceneDelegate\/update(_:for:)]. Other callbacks are illustrated in [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKSceneDelegate]. Modifying SpriteKit objects outside of the scene delegate callbacks (such as in a background queue or anything else not running on the main thread) can result in concurrency related problems. Even dispatching work on the main thread asynchronously or at a later time is risky because the closure is likely to be done outside of the timeframe SpriteKit expects. If you’re experiencing a segmentation fault or other type of crash occurring deep within the SpriteKit framework, there’s a good chance your code is modifying a SpriteKit object outside of the scene delegate callbacks.",
