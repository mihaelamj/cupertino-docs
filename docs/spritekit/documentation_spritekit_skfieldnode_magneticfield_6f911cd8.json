This field models the second part of the Lorentz equation:\n\n*F = qvB*\n\nWhere *F* equals force, *q* equals charge, *v* equals velocity, *B* equals magnetic field and *E* equals electric field.\n\nThe force has a magnitude proportional to the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKFieldNode\/strength] property and the physics body’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody\/charge] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKPhysicsBody\/velocity] properties. Therefore, physics bodies that are either stationary or with a charge of zero will not be affected by a magnetic field. Magnetic fields with a negative strength value impart a clockwise spin on the physics bodies they affect, while a positive strength give a clockwise spin.The [doc:\/\/com.apple.spritekit\/documentation\/SpriteKit\/SKFieldNode\/falloff] property of a magnetic field node is set by default to `2`.",
