Your app uses one (and only one) of the following three approaches to execute blocks submitted to the main queue:\n\n- Calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatchMain()]\n- Starting your app with a call to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:)-1yub7] (iOS) or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplicationMain(_:_:)] (macOS)\n- Using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFRunLoop] on the main thread\n\nAs with the global concurrent queues, calls to [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchObject\/suspend()], [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchObject\/resume()], [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_set_context], and the like have no effect when used on the queue in this property.\n\n\n\nIf your app has a long running task, such as making network call, run it on a global system queue, or on another background dispatch queue. Alternatively, use asynchronous versions of the call, if available.\n\n## Creating a Dispatch Queue\n\n- **global(qos:)**: Returns the global system queue with the specified quality-of-service class.\n- **init(label:qos:attributes:autoreleaseFrequency:target:)**: Creates a new dispatch queue to which you can submit blocks.\n- **DispatchQoS.QoSClass**: Quality-of-service classes that specify the priorities for executing tasks.\n- **DispatchQueue.Attributes**: Attributes that define the behavior of a dispatch queue.\n- **DispatchQueue.AutoreleaseFrequency**: Constants indicating the frequency with which a dispatch queue autoreleases objects.\n- **OS_dispatch_queue_main**: A system-provided dispatch queue that schedules tasks for serial execution on the app’s main thread.\n- **OS_dispatch_queue_global**: A system-provided dispatch queue that schedules tasks for concurrent execution.\n- **DispatchSerialQueue**: A custom dispatch queue that schedules tasks for serial execution on an arbitrary thread.\n- **DispatchConcurrentQueue**: A custom dispatch queue that schedules tasks for concurrent execution.\n- **dispatch_queue_main_t**: A dispatch queue that is bound to the app’s main thread and executes tasks serially on that thread.\n- **dispatch_queue_global_t**: A dispatch queue that executes tasks concurrently using threads from the global thread pool.\n- **dispatch_queue_serial_t**: A dispatch queue that executes tasks serially in first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.\n- **dispatch_queue_concurrent_t**: A dispatch queue that executes tasks concurrently and in any order, respecting any barriers that may be in place.\n\n",
