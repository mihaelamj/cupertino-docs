  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nDispatch, also known as Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), contains language features, runtime libraries, and system enhancements that provide systemic, comprehensive improvements to the support for concurrent code execution on multicore hardware in macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.\n\nThe BSD subsystem, Core Foundation, and Cocoa APIs have all been extended to use these enhancements to help both the system and your application to run faster, more efficiently, and with improved responsiveness. Consider how difficult it is for a single application to use multiple cores effectively, let alone to do it on different computers with different numbers of computing cores or in an environment with multiple applications competing for those cores. GCD, operating at the system level, can better accommodate the needs of all running applications, matching them to the available system resources in a balanced fashion.\n\n### Dispatch Objects and ARC\n\nWhen you build your app using the Objective-C compiler, all dispatch objects are Objective-C objects. As such, when automatic reference counting (ARC) is enabled, dispatch objects are retained and released automatically, just like any other Objective-C object. When ARC is not enabled, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_retain] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_release] functions (or Objective-C semantics) to retain and release your dispatch objects. You cannot use the Core Foundation retain and release functions.\n\nIf you need to use retain and release semantics in an ARC-enabled app with a later deployment target (for maintaining compatibility with existing code), you can disable Objective-C-based dispatch objects by adding `-DOS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC=0` to your compiler flags.",
