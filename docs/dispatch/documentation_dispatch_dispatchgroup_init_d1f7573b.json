In Objective-C returns `NULL` on failure.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function creates a new group with which block objects can be associated (by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_group_async] function). The dispatch group maintains a count of its outstanding associated tasks, incrementing the count when a new task is associated and decrementing it when a task completes. Functions such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_group_notify] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_group_wait] use that count to allow your application to determine when all tasks associated with the group have completed. At that time, your application can take any appropriate action.",
