  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA workloop is a priority-ordered dispatch queue that uses QoS levels to determine the execution order of tasks. Before it starts executing each new task, the queue evaluates the QoS levels of currently enqueued tasks and selects the one with the highest priority. Tasks with the QoS level `QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE` have the highest priority, followed by tasks with the `QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED` priority, and so on.\n\nA workloop is a type of [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_queue_t] object, and you use the same functions to enqueue new tasks. For example, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_async] function to enqueue a task asynchronously.",
