Higher iteration values give the system the ability to balance more efficiently across multiple cores. To get the maximum benefit of this function, configure the number of iterations to be at least three times the number of available cores.\n- **work**: The block to execute in parallel. This block has no return value and takes the following parameter:\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method implements an efficient parallel for-loop.
