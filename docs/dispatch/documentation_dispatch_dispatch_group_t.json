Your application can monitor the blocks in the group synchronously or asynchronously depending on your needs. By extension, a group can be useful for synchronizing for code that depends on the completion of other tasks.\n\nNote that the blocks in a group may be run on different queues, and each individual block can add more blocks to the group.\n\nThe dispatch group keeps track of how many blocks are outstanding, and GCD retains the group until all its associated blocks complete execution.",
