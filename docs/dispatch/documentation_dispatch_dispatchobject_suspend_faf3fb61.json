The suspension occurs after completion of any blocks running at the time of the call. Calling this function increments the suspension count of the object, and calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchObject\/resume()] decrements it. While the count is greater than zero, the object remains suspended, so you must balance each [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchObject\/suspend()] call with a matching [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchObject\/resume()] call.\n\nAny blocks submitted to a dispatch queue or events observed by a dispatch source are delivered once the object is resumed.",
