Unlike [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_async], this function does not return until the block has finished. Calling this function and targeting the current queue results in deadlock.\n\nUnlike with [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_async], no retain is performed on the target queue. Because calls to this function are synchronous, it “borrows” the reference of the caller. Moreover, no `Block_copy` is performed on the block.\n\nAs a performance optimization, this function executes blocks on the current thread whenever possible, with one exception: Blocks submitted to the main dispatch queue always run on the main thread.",
