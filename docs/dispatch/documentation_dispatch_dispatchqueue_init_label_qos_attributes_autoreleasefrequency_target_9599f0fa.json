Because applications, libraries, and frameworks can all create their own dispatch queues, a reverse-DNS naming style (`com.example.myqueue`) is recommended.  This parameter is optional and can be `NULL`.\n- **qos**: The quality-of-service level to associate with the queue. This value determines the priority at which the system schedules tasks for execution. For a list of possible values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQoS\/QoSClass-swift.enum].\n- **attributes**: The attributes to associate with the queue. Include the concurrent attribute to create a dispatch queue that executes tasks concurrently. If you omit that attribute, the dispatch queue executes tasks serially.\n- **autoreleaseFrequency**: The frequency with which to autorelease objects created by the blocks that the queue schedules. For a list of possible values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQueue\/AutoreleaseFrequency].\n- **target**: The target queue on which to execute blocks. Specify `DISPATCH_TARGET_QUEUE_DEFAULT` if you want the system to provide a queue that is appropriate for the current object.\n\n## Creating a Dispatch Queue\n\n- **main**: The dispatch queue associated with the main thread of the current process.\n- **global(qos:)**: Returns the global system queue with the specified quality-of-service class.\n- **DispatchQoS.QoSClass**: Quality-of-service classes that specify the priorities for executing tasks.\n- **DispatchQueue.Attributes**: Attributes that define the behavior of a dispatch queue.\n- **DispatchQueue.AutoreleaseFrequency**: Constants indicating the frequency with which a dispatch queue autoreleases objects.\n- **OS_dispatch_queue_main**: A system-provided dispatch queue that schedules tasks for serial execution on the app’s main thread.\n- **OS_dispatch_queue_global**: A system-provided dispatch queue that schedules tasks for concurrent execution.\n- **DispatchSerialQueue**: A custom dispatch queue that schedules tasks for serial execution on an arbitrary thread.\n- **DispatchConcurrentQueue**: A custom dispatch queue that schedules tasks for concurrent execution.\n- **dispatch_queue_main_t**: A dispatch queue that is bound to the app’s main thread and executes tasks serially on that thread.\n- **dispatch_queue_global_t**: A dispatch queue that executes tasks concurrently using threads from the global thread pool.\n- **dispatch_queue_serial_t**: A dispatch queue that executes tasks serially in first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.\n- **dispatch_queue_concurrent_t**: A dispatch queue that executes tasks concurrently and in any order, respecting any barriers that may be in place.\n\n",
