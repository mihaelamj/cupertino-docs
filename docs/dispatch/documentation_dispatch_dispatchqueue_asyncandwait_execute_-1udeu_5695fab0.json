Unlike [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_async], this function does not return until after the block finishes. Calling this function and targeting the current queue results in deadlock.\n\nUnlike [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQueue\/sync(execute:)-3segw], this function respects all attributes of the queue when it executes the block. For example, it respects the quality-of-service level and autorelease frequency of the target queue.\n\nIf the runtime has already brought up a thread to service asynchronous work items, the system uses that same thread to execute any synchronous blocks you submitted using this function. If the runtime hasn’t brought up a thread to service asynchronous work items, the sytem executes these synchronous blocks on the current thread as an optimization. However, these optimizations apply only when `queue` targets a global concurrent queue. If it targets any other queue, the system executes the work on that queue’s thread. For example, if `queue` targets the main queue, the block always runs on the main thread.\n\nUnlike with [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_async], no retain is performed on the target queue. Because calls to this function are synchronous, it “borrows” the reference of the caller. Moreover, no `Block_copy` is performed on the block.",
