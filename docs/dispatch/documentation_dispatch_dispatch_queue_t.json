A serial queue invokes only one block at a time, but independent queues may each invoke their blocks concurrently with respect to each other.\n\nThe global concurrent queues invoke blocks in FIFO order but do not wait for their completion, allowing multiple blocks to be invoked concurrently.\n\nThe system manages a pool of threads that process dispatch queues and invoke blocks submitted to them. Conceptually, a dispatch queue may have its own thread of execution, and interaction between queues is highly asynchronous.\n\nDispatch queues are reference counted via calls to [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_retain] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.dispatch\/documentation\/Dispatch\/dispatch_release]. Pending blocks submitted to a queue also hold a reference to the queue until they have finished. Once all references to a queue have been released, the queue will be deallocated by the system.",
