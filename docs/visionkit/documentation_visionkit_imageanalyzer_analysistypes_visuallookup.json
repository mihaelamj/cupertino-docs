For example, if an image contains a rose, the framework recognizes a plant and enables people to tap the plant which presents a sheet with a list of additional resources on the specific type of plant — in this case, a rose.\n\nFor more information about subjects in images, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.VisionKit\/documentation\/VisionKit\/ImageAnalysisInteraction\/Subject].",
