This includes endpoint resolution when applicable.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.connected**: The connection is established. It is now possible to transfer data. If TLS is in use, the TLS handshake has finished.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.disconnected**: The connection is disconnected. It is no longer possible to transfer data. The application should call `cancel` to clean up resources.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.cancelled**: The connection has been cancelled by the client calling `cancel`.\n\n",
