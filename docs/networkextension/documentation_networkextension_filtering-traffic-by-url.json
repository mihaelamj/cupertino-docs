Set the developer team for all targets to your team so Xcode automatically manages the provisioning profile. For more information, see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev23aab79b4].\n2. Optionally build and run the Private Information Retrieval (PIR) server sample provided with the sample code download. If you have your own PIR server ready for use, you can use that instead.\n\n## URL filters\n\n- **NEURLFilterManager**: A class you use to configure and control a URL filter.\n- **NEURLFilterControlProvider**: A protocol that defines an object that’s responsible for fetching pre-filter data.\n- **NEURLFilterControlProviderConfiguration**: A class that defines app extension configurations for the URL Filter control provider app extension.\n- **NEURLFilter**: A class used to voluntarily validate URLs for apps that don’t use WebKit or the URL session API.\n\n",
