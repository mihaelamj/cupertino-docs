Open `SimplePush.xcworkspace` and set the development team in the build settings of all five targets across the three projects. After you’ve set the team, Xcode automatically creates unique bundle identifiers that you use in the following steps.\n2. Sign into your account on the Apple Developer website and register a new App Group and two App IDs: one for the SimplePush app and one for the SimplePushProvider extension. Configure each App ID with the App Groups and Network Extensions capabilities. After you register the IDs, create two provisioning profiles (one for each identifier) that include the App Push Provider entitlement.\n3. Import the newly created provisioning profiles into Xcode.\n4. In the SimplePush project, configure the `SimplePush` and `SimplePushProvider` targets with the imported provisioning profiles, deselect the existing App Group, and select the new App Group identifier you created in step 2.\n5. Update the `pushProviderBundleIdentifier` in `PushConfigurationManager.swift` with the bundle identifier set on the `SimplePushProvider` target.\n\n### Build and Run the Sample Server\n\nSelect the `SimplePushServer` build scheme and your Mac as the run destination, then run the project to start the server.\n\n### Build, Run, and Configure the Sample App\n\nWith the server running, select the `SimplePush` iOS build scheme and run the project on your iOS device. When `SimplePush` starts, update the app’s settings to connect to the server. Tap the Settings button and enter the following information:\n\n1. Enter the Server Address, which is the IP address or hostname of the Mac where `SimplePushServer` is running.\n2. Enter one or more of the following network configurations:\n\n- Wi-Fi — Enter the SSID of your local Wi-Fi network. The `NEAppPushProvider` runs when your device joins the Wi-Fi network with the SSID you’ve specified.\n- Cellular—Enter the Mobile Country Code and Mobile Network Code of your cellular provider. If the device is connected to a Band 48 CBRS cellular network, enter the Tracking Area Code for the network.\n- Ethernet — The `NEAppPushProvider` runs when your device is connected to an Ethernet network and the ethernet network is the primary route on the device.\n\n\n\nAfter configuring the settings above, the Local Push Connectivity - Active setting displays “Yes” when `NEAppPushProvider` is running. You must perform the steps above on at least two iOS devices so you can test and observe message exchanges between clients.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **NEAppPushManager**: An object that configures a push provider and manages its life cycle.\n- **NEAppPushProvider**: An object that creates and maintains a persistent network connection to a local push server.\n- **Maintaining a Reliable Network Connection**: Implement your Local Push Connectivity app to ensure delivery of notifications.\n\n",
