  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis method attempts to join the network only if it’s found nearby. Also, because of the noticeable delay that the Hotspot 2.0 discovery mechanism may incur, the method doesn’t attempt to join Hotspot 2.0 networks.\n\nIn addition to providing an SSID for the Wi-Fi network, your app must provide configuration and authentication information using [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEHotspotEAPSettings] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEHotspotHS20Settings]. With Hotspot 2.0 networks, the app must provide an HS2.0 domain name instead of an SSID.\n\nThis method won’t add a configuration if the same SSID or HS2.0 domain name is already configured through a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile or a Carrier bundle. If your app configures a hotspot and later an MDM profile or Carrier bundle is installed for a hotspot with the same domain name, the new configuration will overwrite your app’s configuration.\n\nThe system calls your completion handler when it has applied the Wi-Fi level configuration. A successful configuration doesnʼt mean the device has joined that Wi-Fi network. To get the current Wi-Fi state, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEHotspotNetwork\/fetchCurrent(completionHandler:)].\n\nFurthermore, joining a Wi-Fi network doesn’t guarantee that the network is fully operational. The system might still be in the process of configuring TCP\/IP on that network. If you plan to connect to a service on that network, use an API that waits for connectivity. For example:",
