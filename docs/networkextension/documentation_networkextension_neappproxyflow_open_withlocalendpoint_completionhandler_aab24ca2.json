For example, if the app used the Network framework, it gets this information from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Network\/NWPath\/localEndpoint] property of the current path. If it used BSD Sockets, it gets this information by calling `getsockname`.\n\nPass `nil` to have the system derive a value based on the address of the current primary physical interface.\n- **completionHandler**: Called when the open operation is complete.
