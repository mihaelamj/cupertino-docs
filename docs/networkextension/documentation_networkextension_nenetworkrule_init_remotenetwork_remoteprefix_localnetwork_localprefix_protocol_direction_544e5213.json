This endpoint must contain an address, not a hostname.\n- **remotePrefix**: An integer that in combination with the address in `remoteNetwork` specifies the remote network that the rule matches.\n- **localNetwork**: An endpoint instance that contains the local port and the local address or network that the rule matches. This endpoint must contain an address, not a hostname.\n- **localPrefix**: An integer that in combination with the address in localNetwork specifies the local network that the rule matches. The rule ignores this parameter if `localNetwork` is `nil`.\n- **protocol**: The protocol that the rule matches.\n- **direction**: The direction of network traffic that the rule matches.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the port string of `remoteNetwork` is `0` or the empty string, then the rule matches traffic on any port coming from the remote network. If `remoteNetwork` is `nil`, the rule matches any remote network.\n\nIf the port string of `localNetwork` is `0` or the empty string, then the rule matches traffic on any port coming from the local network. If `localNetwork` is `nil`, the rule matches any local network.\n\n## Creating a network rule\n\n- **init(destinationNetwork:prefix:protocol:)**: Creates a rule that matches network traffic destined for a host within a specific network.\n- **init(destinationHost:protocol:)**: Creates a rule that matches network traffic destined for a host within a specific DNS domain.\n\n",
