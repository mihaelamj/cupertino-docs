This includes endpoint resolution when applicable.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.waiting**: The connection has attempted to connect but failed. It is now waiting for better conditions before trying again.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.connected**: The connection is established. It is now possible to transfer data. If TLS is in use, the TLS handshake has finished.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.cancelled**: The connection has been cancelled by the client calling `cancel`.\n\n",
