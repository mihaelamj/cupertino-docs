The packets that were read are passed to this block in the `packets` array. The protocol numbers of the packets that were read are passed to this block in the `protocols` array. Each packet has a protocol number in the corresponding index in the `protocols` array. The protocol numbers are given in host byte order. Valid protocol numbers include `AF_INET` and `AF_INET6`. See `\/usr\/include\/sys\/socket.h`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nEach call to this method results in a single execution of the completion handler. The caller should call this method after each `completionHandler` execution in order to continue to receive packets from the TUN interface.\n\n## Handling IP packets\n\n- **readPacketObjects(completionHandler:)**: Read multiple IP packets from the TUN interface.\n- **writePacketObjects(_:)**: Write multiple IP packets to the TUN interface.\n- **writePackets(_:withProtocols:)**: Writes IP packets to the TUN interface.\n\n",
