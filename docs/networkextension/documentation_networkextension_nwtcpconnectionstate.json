This includes endpoint resolution when applicable.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.waiting**: The connection has attempted to connect but failed. It is now waiting for better conditions before trying again.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.connected**: The connection is established. It is now possible to transfer data. If TLS is in use, the TLS handshake has finished.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.disconnected**: The connection is disconnected. It is no longer possible to transfer data. The application should call `cancel` to clean up resources.\n- **NWTCPConnectionState.cancelled**: The connection has been cancelled by the client calling `cancel`.\n\n## Initializers\n\n- **init(rawValue:)**\n\n## Monitoring the connection status\n\n- **state**: The status of the connection.\n- **isViable**: The viability of a TCP connection indicates whether or not data can be transferred.\n- **error**: The connection-wide error property.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- BitwiseCopyable\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- RawRepresentable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
