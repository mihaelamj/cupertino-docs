Specifically, you can:\n\n- Change the system’s Wi-Fi configuration\n- Integrate your app with the hotspot network subsystem (Hotspot Helper)\n- Create and manage VPN configurations, using the built-in VPN protocols (Personal VPN) or a custom VPN protocol\n- Create and manage network relay configurations\n- Implement an on-device content filter\n- Create and manage system-wide DNS configurations, using the built-in DNS protocols or a custom on-device DNS proxy\n\nThe NetworkExtension framework is available in macOS, iOS, tvOS, and visionOS, but not all features are available on all platforms and some features have specific restrictions (for example, some features only work on supervised iOS devices).
