The system uses the verdict’s `remediationURLMapKey` and `remediationButtonTextMapKey` to look up the remediation URL parameters in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEFilterControlProvider\/remediationMap] dictionary set by the Filter Control Provider.\n2. The system then inserts the remediation URL parameters into the block page and presents it to the user.\n\nThe user can tap the URL to appeal the decision to drop the flow. This starts the remediation process, if your app provides one.\n\n## Creating data verdicts\n\n- **allow()**: Creates a verdict that tells the system to pass the current chunk of network data and all subsequent data for the current flow to its final destination.\n- **drop()**: Creates a verdict that tells the system to drop the current chunk of network data and all subsequent data for the current flow.\n- **pause()**: Creates a verdict that tells the system to pause the flow.\n- **needRules()**: Creates a verdict that tells the system that the Filter Control Provider needs to update the rules before making a decision about the flow’s data.\n- **init(passBytes:peekBytes:)**: Creates a verdict that tells the system to pass a chunk of network data to its final destination, and specifies the next chunk of data to provide.\n\n",
