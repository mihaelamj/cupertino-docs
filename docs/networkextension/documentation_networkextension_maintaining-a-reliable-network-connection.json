  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nBy implementing Local Push Connectivity, your app can perform many of the tasks provided by Apple Push Notification Service (APNs), even on restricted or isolated networks where APNs is unavailable. Create push notifications by delivering messages from a server to your client, which then uses a local notification or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CallKit] to alert the user.\n\nWhen you adopt Local Push Connectivity, you’re responsible for establishing and maintaining a reliable connection between your server and your client. To keep the connection viable, use the following best practices to maintain your client’s life cycle and connect over the local network.\n\n### Implement the Push Provider App Extension Life Cycle\n\nTo implement Local Push Connectivity on a local network, create both a local server and an app that receives notifications from this server. Create an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushManager] when your client app starts up, and set its [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushManager\/matchSSIDs] property to a set of known Wi-Fi network SSIDs\n\nTo receive notifications from your server, create an app extension that extends [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider].

Use this callback to set up the connection to your server and call the completion handler, passing in an error if the connection failed. The following example attempts to get the host name from the push provider’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/providerConfiguration], and calls a method to connect to the host.\n\nEnsure that the extension can launch when the system needs it and can continue running, because both are essential for your app extension to participate in local push connectivity. Use the following guidelines when writing your extension:\n\n### Establish and Monitor the Network Connection\n\nAs shown in the previous section, your client extension creates its connection to your server in your implementation of the push provider’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/start(completionHandler:)] method. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Network] framework to create and maintain this connection.

Create push notifications by delivering messages from a server to your client, which then uses a local notification or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CallKit] to alert the user.\n\nWhen you adopt Local Push Connectivity, you’re responsible for establishing and maintaining a reliable connection between your server and your client.

Create an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushManager] when your client app starts up, and set its [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushManager\/matchSSIDs] property to a set of known Wi-Fi network SSIDs\n\nTo receive notifications from your server, create an app extension that extends [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider]. When the user’s device joins one of the registered networks, the sytem automatically launches your push provider extension.\n\nAfter your push provider extension launches, the system calls its [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/start(completionHandler:)] method. Use this callback to set up the connection to your server and call the completion handler, passing in an error if the connection failed. The following example attempts to get the host name from the push provider’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/providerConfiguration], and calls a method to connect to the host.\n\n```swift\noverride func start(completionHandler: @escaping (Error?) -> Void) {\n    guard let host = providerConfiguration?[\"host\"] as? String else {\n        let error = MyPushProviderError(\"Provider configuration is missing value for key: `host`\")\n        completionHandler(error)\n        return\n    }\n    \n    myChannel.setHost(host)\n    myChannel.connect()\n    \n    completionHandler(nil)\n}\n```\n\nEnsure that the extension can launch when the system needs it and can continue running, because both are essential for your app extension to participate in local push connectivity. Use the following guidelines when writing your extension:\n\n- Your extension must maintain a small memory footprint, or the system may terminate it. Use the Allocations and Leaks templates in Xcode Instruments to analyze your extension’s “dirty” memory usage and identify any memory leaks.\n- Your extension continues to run as long as the device remains connected to the registered SSID. If the extension crashes, or if the system terminates it for using too much memory, iOS relaunches it.\n- The user’s device can’t reconnect to a secure Wi-Fi network until the first unlock after it boots, because the device needs access to protected Wi-Fi credentials stored in the Keychain.\n- When the device leaves the known Wi-Fi network, the system calls your push provider’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/stop(with:completionHandler:)] method. Implement this method to disconnect from the server and release any previously allocated resources.\n- Confirm that your [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider] implementation doesn’t create a retain cycle with itself. After you call the `completionHandler` that the system passes to [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/stop(with:completionHandler:)], the Network Extension framework releases your [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider] instance. This instance typically deallocates from memory when released, but if the instance has a retain cycle with itself, it fails to deallocate and wastes memory. Failure to deallocate can also cause the system to have two or more instances of your push provider, leading to inconsistent behavior. Use Instruments or add a logging statement to `deinit` to verify that your [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider] deinitializes when expected.\n\n### Establish and Monitor the Network Connection\n\nAs shown in the previous section, your client extension creates its connection to your server in your implementation of the push provider’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/start(completionHandler:)] method. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Network] framework to create and maintain this connection. The Network framework is an ideal choice to implement Local Push Connectivity, because it provides features like path monitors, TLS negotiation, and support for custom protocol framers.\n\nEnsure each side of the connection monitors the health of the other side:\n\n- Have your server periodically send heartbeat messages to the client. This ensures the push provider remains responsive, even when the user isn’t actively using the device. The push provider must acknowledge these messages, so the server can rapidly detect when the client disconnects unexpectedly.\n- Your push provider must implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/handleTimerEvent()] callback method, which the framework calls every 60 seconds. Implement this method to check the status of the connection on the client end.\n\nThe following example implements [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEAppPushProvider\/handleTimerEvent()] by checking the last time the client received a heartbeat message from the server. If it exceeds the expected interval, it cancels the current connection and reconnects to the server.\n\n```swift\noverride func handleTimerEvent() {\n    dispatchQueue.async { [weak self] in\n        guard let self = self, self.isRunning else {\n            return\n        }\n        \n        let expirationTime = self.lastCheckinTime.advanced(by: self.interval)\n        \n        if .now() >= expirationTime {\n            self.logger.log(\"Heartbeat didn't check in within the interval of \\(self.interval), calling network session disconnect.\")\n            self.session?.disconnect()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Optimize the Network Architecture\n\nIf the Wi-Fi network is under your control, configure the network to better support your app’s client-server connection.
