Each rule is evaluated in order against the properties of a network connection being established. An example configuration has two connection rules: a rule matching `myserver.example.com` with the domain action [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEEvaluateConnectionRuleAction\/neverConnect], followed by a rule matching `example.com` with the domain action [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEEvaluateConnectionRuleAction\/connectIfNeeded]. This configuration would cause all connections to hostnames in `example.com` that do not resolve on the current network to trigger the VPN, except for `myserver.example.com`.",
