  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nURL filters allow you to filter URL requests by analyzing the full URL against your URL data set (containing URLs you want to block) and determining whether to allow or block access to the URL.\n\nNetwork Extension URL Filter examines all URL requests sent via WebKit and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSession] API. You create and manage a URL filter by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEURLFilterManager] API and implementing the [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEURLFilterControlProvider] protocol as your app extension to fetch a Bloom filter onto the device. Network Extension performs URL filtering on your behalf with your URL data set, using both the Bloom filter on the device as well as an off-device database hosted on your Private Information Retrieval (PIR) server. The system first consults the Bloom filter for a quick URL check, and may perform off-device database lookups with your PIR server if necessary. With this appoach, Network Extension URL Filter provides a performant yet privacy-preserving solution for both consumer and managed deployments.\n\nFor an example of writing and configuring a URL filter extension, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/filtering-traffic-by-url] sample code project.\n\nFor browsers or any app that doesn’t use WebKit or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSession], use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEURLFilter] Participation API to voluntarily check URLs. Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEURLFilter\/verdict(for:)] method to check all URL requests and honor the returned verdict by failing the URL requests for blocked URLs.",
