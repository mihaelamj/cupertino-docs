Also, because of the noticeable delay that the Hotspot 2.0 discovery mechanism may incur, the method doesn’t attempt to join Hotspot 2.0 networks.\n\nIn addition to providing an SSID for the Wi-Fi network, your app must provide configuration and authentication information using [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEHotspotEAPSettings] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEHotspotHS20Settings]. With Hotspot 2.0 networks, the app must provide an HS2.0 domain name instead of an SSID.\n\nThis method won’t add a configuration if the same SSID or HS2.0 domain name is already configured through a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile or a Carrier bundle. If your app configures a hotspot and later an MDM profile or Carrier bundle is installed for a hotspot with the same domain name, the new configuration will overwrite your app’s configuration.\n\nThe system calls your completion handler when it has applied the Wi-Fi level configuration. A successful configuration doesnʼt mean the device has joined that Wi-Fi network. To get the current Wi-Fi state, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.networkextension\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEHotspotNetwork\/fetchCurrent(completionHandler:)].\n\nFurthermore, joining a Wi-Fi network doesn’t guarantee that the network is fully operational. The system might still be in the process of configuring TCP\/IP on that network. If you plan to connect to a service on that network, use an API that waits for connectivity. For example:",
