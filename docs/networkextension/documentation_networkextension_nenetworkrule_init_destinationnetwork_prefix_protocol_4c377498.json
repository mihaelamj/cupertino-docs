This endpoint must contain an address, not a hostname.\n- **destinationPrefix**: An integer that in combination with the address in the endpoint specifies the destination network that the rule matches.\n- **protocol**: The protocol that the rule matches.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the port string of `networkEndpoint` is `0` or the empty string, the rule matches traffic on any port destined for the given address or network.\n\n## Creating a network rule\n\n- **init(destinationHost:protocol:)**: Creates a rule that matches network traffic destined for a host within a specific DNS domain.\n- **init(remoteNetwork:remotePrefix:localNetwork:localPrefix:protocol:direction:)**: Creates a rule that matches traffic by remote network, local network, protocol, and direction.\n\n",
