This is unnecessary if the descriptor has only one report.\n- **timeout**: The maximum amount of time to wait for the device to receive the report before the call times out and fails. Not providing a duration causes the call to wait forever.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe data that the device returned. Reference the device’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.CoreHID\/documentation\/CoreHID\/HIDDeviceClient\/descriptor] to determine what data the device may respond with.\n\n## Discussion\n\nMany HID devices respond to get report requests to retrieve information from the device.
