Determining the correct values can be aided by referencing the device’s report descriptor. If there are multiple reports, the first byte should be the report ID.\n- **timestamp**: The time that the report originated.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis dispatches an input report to the system, as if a person is interacting with a physical control.
