Interactions include receiving data that a device generates, such as a key press or mouse click. CoreHID also allows sending requests to a device, such as a request to turn on an LED. You can also emulate a device connected to the system, such as a virtual game controller, and send input to other apps without physical hardware.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about HID devices, see the [https:\/\/www.usb.org\/hid].",
