Do this when you want to notarize a new version of your software.\n\nYou provide an HTTP body that contains a name for the submission, a hash of the software that you plan to submit, and an optional webhook that the service uses to notify you when notarization completes. For the name, use the name of the file that you upload, including the `dmg` or `zip` extension. The service responds with temporary security credentials that you use to submit the software to Amazon S3 and a submission identifier that you use to track the submission’s status.\n\nAfter uploading your software, you can use the identifier to ask the notary service for the status of your submission using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.notaryapi\/documentation\/NotaryAPI\/Get-Submission-Status] endpoint. If you lose the identifier, you can get a list of your team’s 100 most recent submissions using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.notaryapi\/documentation\/NotaryAPI\/Get-Previous-Submissions] endpoint. After notarization completes, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.notaryapi\/documentation\/NotaryAPI\/Get-Submission-Log] to get details about the outcome of notarization. Do this even if notarization succeeds, because the log might contain warnings that you can fix before your next submission.\n\n### Example",
