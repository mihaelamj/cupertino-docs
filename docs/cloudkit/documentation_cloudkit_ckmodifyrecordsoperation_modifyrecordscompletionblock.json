  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis property is a closure that returns no value and has the following parameters:\n\nThe closure executes only once, and represents your final opportunity to process the operation’s results. It executes after all record progress closures and record completion closures finish. The closure executes serially with respect to the other  closures of the operation.\n\nAlthough this closure executes after the modification of records completes, it executes prior to the indexing of queries for those modified records. Therefore, if a query executes in this completion closure, the results of that query might not include the changes from this operation. Conversely, records that CloudKit fetches in the completion closure are up to date with the changes from the associated operation.\n\nThe closure reports an error of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKError\/Code\/partialFailure] when it modifies only some of the records successfully. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSError\/userInfo] dictionary of the error contains a [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKPartialErrorsByItemIDKey] key that has a dictionary as its value. The keys of the dictionary are the IDs of the records that the operation can’t modify, and the corresponding values are errors that contain information about the failures.\n\nIf you intend to use this closure to process results, set it before you execute the operation or submit the operation to a queue.",
