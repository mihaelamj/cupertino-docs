If the change token isn’t the more recent change token you provided, the server might not have received the associated changes.\n- A Boolean that indicates whether this is the final record zone change. If [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation\/fetchAllChanges] is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], it’s the app’s responsibility to create additional instances of [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation] to fetch further changes.\n- An error object that contains information about a problem, or `nil` if the operation successfully retrieves the results.\n\nThe app is responsible for saving the change token at the end of the operation and providing it to future uses of [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKFetchRecordZoneChangesOperation].
