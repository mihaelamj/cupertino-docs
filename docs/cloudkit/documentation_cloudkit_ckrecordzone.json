  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nZones are an important part of how you organize your data. The public and private databases each have a single default zone. In the private database, you can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecordZone] objects to create additional custom zones as necessary. Use custom zones to arrange and encapsulate groups of related records in the private database. Custom zones support other capabilities too, such as the ability to write multiple records as a single atomic transaction.\n\nTreat each custom zone as a single unit of data that is separate from every other zone in the database. Inside the zone, you add records as you would anywhere else. You can also create links between the records inside a zone by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecord\/Reference] class. However, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecord\/Reference] class doesn’t support cross-zone linking, so each reference object must point to a record in the same zone as the current record.\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecordZone] class as-is and don’t subclass it.\n\n### Creating a Custom Record Zone\n\nGenerally, you use instances of this class to create and manage custom zones. Although you can use this class to retrieve a database’s default zone, most operations act on records in the default zone by default, so you rarely need to specify it explicitly.\n\nTo create a custom zone, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecordZone] to create the zone object, and then save that zone to the user’s private database using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKModifyRecordZonesOperation] object. You can’t save any records in the zone until you save it to the database. When creating records, explicitly specify the zone ID if you want the records to reside in a specific zone; otherwise, they save to the default zone. You can’t create custom zones in a public database.\n\nAfter creating a `CKRecordZone` object and saving it to the database, you don’t interact with the object much. Instead, most interactions occur with its corresponding [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecordZone\/ID] object, which you use to refer to the zone when creating records.",
