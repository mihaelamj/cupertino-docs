The default value is `nil`, which causes the system to fetch all keys of the record.\n\nBecause the records you fetch can be of different types, configure the array to include the merged set of all field names for the requested records and at least one field name from each record type.\n\nIf you intend to specify the desired set of keys, set the value of this property before executing the operation or submitting it to a queue.",
