Each time the closure executes, it executes serially with respect to the other progress closures of the operation. You can use this closure to track the ongoing progress of the operation.\n\nIf you intend to use this closure to process results, set it before you execute the operation or add the operation to a queue.",

The range is `0.0` to `1.0`, where `0.0` indicates that CloudKit hasn’t saved any data, and `1.0` means that CloudKit has saved the entire record.\n\nThe modify records operation executes this closure one or more times for each record in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKModifyRecordsOperation\/recordsToSave] property. Each time the closure executes, it executes serially with respect to the other progress closures of the operation. You can use this closure to track the ongoing progress of the operation.\n\nIf you intend to use this closure to process results, set it before you execute the operation or add the operation to a queue.\n\n## Processing the Modify Record Results\n\n- **perRecordCompletionBlock**: The closure to execute when CloudKit saves a record.\n- **modifyRecordsCompletionBlock**: The closure to execute after CloudKit modifies all of the records.\n\n",
