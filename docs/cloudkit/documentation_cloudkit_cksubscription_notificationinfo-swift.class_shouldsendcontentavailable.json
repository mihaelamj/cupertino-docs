The app then receives background execution time to download any data for the push notification, such as the set of changed records. If the app is already running in the foreground, the inclusion of this flag has no additional effect and the system delivers the notification to the app delegate for processing as usual.\n\nThe default value of this property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false].",
