The closure must be capable of executing on a background thread, so any tasks that require access to the main thread must redirect accordingly.\n\nThe closure reports an error of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKError\/Code\/partialFailure] when it retrieves only some of the record zones successfully. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSError\/userInfo] dictionary of the error contains a [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKPartialErrorsByItemIDKey] key that has a dictionary as its value. The keys of the dictionary are the IDs of the record zones that the operation can’t retrieve, and the corresponding values are errors that contain information about the failures.\n\nIf you intend to use this closure to process results, set it before you execute the operation or submit the operation to a queue.",
