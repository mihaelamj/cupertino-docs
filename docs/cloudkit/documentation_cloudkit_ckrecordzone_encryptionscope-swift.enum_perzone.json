Note that:\n\n- Record zones using per-zone encryption only support zone-wide sharing.\n- Encryption scope can only be assigned at zone creation and cannot be changed for the lifetime of the zone.\n- The server will not return zones using per-zone encryption to device OS versions older than the corresponding API availability version.\n- An older OS trying to overwrite an existing zone using per-zone encryption due to a naming collision will result in a `.serverRejectedRequest` error.\n- On device OS upgrade, your application is responsible for fetching database changes via `CKFetchDatabaseChangesOperation` with a nil sync token to ensure it has received all the zones available to it from the server.\n\n",
