When executing searches for a cursor, don’t cache cursors for a long time before using them. A cursor isn’t a snapshot of the previous search results; it stores a relative offset into the results list. An operation that you create from a cursor performs a new search, sorts the new set of results, and uses the previous offset value to determine where the next batch of results starts.",
