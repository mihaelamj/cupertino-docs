Each time the closure executes, it executes serially with respect to the other progress closures of the operation. You can use this closure to track the ongoing progress of the download operation.\n\nIf you intend to use this closure to process results, set it before you execute the operation or add the operation to a queue.",

The range is `0.0` to `1.0`, where `0.0` indicates that CloudKit hasn’t downloaded anything, and `1.0` means the download is complete.\n\nThe fetch operation executes this closure one or more times for each record ID in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKFetchRecordsOperation\/recordIDs] property. Each time the closure executes, it executes serially with respect to the other progress closures of the operation. You can use this closure to track the ongoing progress of the download operation.\n\nIf you intend to use this closure to process results, set it before you execute the operation or add the operation to a queue.\n\n## Processing Record Fetch Results\n\n- **perRecordCompletionBlock**: The closure to execute when a record becomes available.\n- **fetchRecordsCompletionBlock**: The closure to execute after CloudKit retrieves all of the records.\n\n",
