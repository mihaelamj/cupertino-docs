The closure executes after all of the individual progress closures, but before the operation’s completion closure. The closure executes serially with respect to the other progress closures of the operation.\n\nThe closure reports an error of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKError\/Code\/partialFailure] when it retrieves only some of the records successfully. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSError\/userInfo] dictionary of the error contains a [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKPartialErrorsByItemIDKey] key that has a dictionary as its value. The keys of the dictionary are the IDs of the records that the operation can’t retrieve, and the corresponding values are errors that contain information about the failures.\n\nIf you intend to use this closure to process results, set it before you execute the operation or submit the operation to a queue.",

The value of each key is the actual [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecord] object that CloudKit returns.\n- If CloudKit can’t retrieve any of the records, an error that provides information about the failure; otherwise, `nil`.\n\nThe fetch operation executes this closure only once, and it’s your final opportunity to process the results. The closure executes after all of the individual progress closures, but before the operation’s completion closure.
