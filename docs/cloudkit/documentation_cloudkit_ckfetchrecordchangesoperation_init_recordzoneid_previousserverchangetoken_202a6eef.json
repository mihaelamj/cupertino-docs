The zone can be a custom zone. The system doesn’t support syncing the default zone.\n- **previousServerChangeToken**: The change token from a previous fetch operation. This is the token that the system passes to your [doc:\/\/com.apple.cloudkit\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKFetchRecordChangesOperation\/fetchRecordChangesCompletionBlock] handler during a previous fetch operation. Use this token to limit the returned data to only those changes that occur after that fetch request. If you specify `nil` for this parameter, the operation object fetches all records and their contents.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn initialized operation object.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen initializing the operation object, use the token from a previous fetch request if you have one.
