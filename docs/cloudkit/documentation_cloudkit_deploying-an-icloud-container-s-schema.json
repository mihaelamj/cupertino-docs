Otherwise, the development schema reverts to the state of the production environment.\n\nTo reset the development environment to the current state of production:\n\n1. Sign in to CloudKit Console at [https:\/\/icloud.developer.apple.com\/].\n2. Select the CloudKit Database app.\n3. In the top section, choose your app’s container from the list.\n4. On the left of the screen, select Reset Environment.\n5. In the dialog that appears, read the warning, select the checkbox, and click Reset.\n\n\n\n### Deploy the development schema\n\nAfter you finalize your schema and test your app in the development environment, you’re ready to deploy the schema to production in the CloudKit Database app. Deploying the schema copies its record types, fields, and indexes to the production environment, but doesn’t copy any records.

On the left, select Deploy Schema Changes.\n5. Review the pending deployment changes and click Deploy.\n\n\n\n## Container Management\n\n- **Inspecting and Editing an iCloud Container’s Schema**: Review and edit the schema for your app’s container using the CloudKit Database app.\n- **Handling an iCloud Container’s Data**: Inspect and manage your app’s iCloud container data using the CloudKit Database app.\n- **Obtaining an API Token for an iCloud Container**: Generate an API token to access CloudKit web services or use CloudKit JS.\n\n",
