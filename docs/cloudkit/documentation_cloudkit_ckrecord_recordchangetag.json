However, at any time after you fetch a record, other users might save a newer version of it to the server. Every time CloudKit saves a record, the server updates the record’s change token to a new value. When you save your copy of the record, the server compares your record’s token with the token on the server. If the two tokens match, the server interprets that you modified the latest version of the record and that it can apply your changes immediately. If the two tokens don’t match, the server checks your app’s save policy to determine how to proceed.\n\nIn your own code, you can use change tokens to distinguish between two different versions of the same record.",
