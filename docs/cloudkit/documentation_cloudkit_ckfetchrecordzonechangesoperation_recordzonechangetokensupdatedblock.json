You can store this token locally and use it during subsequent fetch operations to limit the results to records that change after this operation executes.\n- The most recent client change token from the device. If the change token isn’t the most recent change token you provided, the server might not have received the associated changes.\n\nThe operation executes this closure once for each record zone. Each time the closure executes, it executes serially with respect to the other blocks of the operation.\n\nSet this property before you execute the operation or submit it to a queue.\n\n## Processing the Zone Change Operation Results\n\n- **recordChangedBlock**: The closure to execute with the contents of a changed record.\n- **recordWithIDWasDeletedBlock**: The closure to execute when a record no longer exists.\n- **recordZoneFetchCompletionBlock**: The closure to execute when a record zone’s fetch finishes.\n- **fetchRecordZoneChangesCompletionBlock**: The closure to execute when the operation finishes.\n\n",
