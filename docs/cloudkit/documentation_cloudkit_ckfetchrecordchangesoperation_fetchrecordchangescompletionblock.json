If that property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], you must create another operation object using the value in the `serverChangeToken` parameter to fetch any remaining changes.\n\nThe operation object executes this block only once at the conclusion of the operation. It executes after all individual change blocks, but before the operation’s completion block. The block executes serially with respect to the other progress blocks of the operation.\n\nIf you intend to use this block to process results, set it before executing the operation or submitting the operation object to a queue.",
