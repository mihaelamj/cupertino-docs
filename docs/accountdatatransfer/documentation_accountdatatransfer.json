The data available relates to a user’s use of Apple’s App Store and includes information such as previous transactions and downloads.\n\nTo access the data, you need to acquire an access token with the `appstore-user-profile` read-only scope, and at least one of these scopes:\n\nYou also need to supply the query parameter `consent_mode`, with the value `auth3p`, in your call to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AccountOrganizationalDataSharing\/Request-an-authorization].\n\nTo get permission for your App ID or Services ID to request these scopes, follow the instructions at [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/service-configurations\/share-account-and-organizational-data].\n\n### Set required HTTP headers\n\nWhen you make requests for someone’s App Store information and app-install activity, using any of the endpoints listed below, set the following HTTP headers:\n\n### Submit a request\n\nMake an HTTP `POST` request to the [doc:\/\/org.swift.docc.AccountDataTransfer\/documentation\/AccountDataTransfer\/Submit-request] endpoint, requesting the `app-store` data type. To make a one-time request, set the `mode` key to `ONE_TIME`. To make recurring requests, use one of the following values:\n\nThe Apple server returns a request ID, which you use when you get the request status, request download URLs, or cancel the request. For recurring requests, the Apple server returns a request ID, along with the parent ID that identifies the series of recurring requests.\n\nThe response from the server also contains a `statusCheckDelay`, which is the number of seconds you need to wait before checking the status of the request. You can cancel a request before this time by making a `POST` request to the [doc:\/\/org.swift.docc.AccountDataTransfer\/documentation\/AccountDataTransfer\/Cancel-request] endpoint.\n\nIf you submit a `DAILY_30` recurring request and don’t resubmit the recurring instance each subsequent day, the recurring request expires 40 days after submission of the request.\n\nIf you submit a `WEEKLY_180` recurring request and don’t resubmit the recurring instance each subsequent week, the recurring request expires 190 days after submission of the request.\n\n### Find the request status\n\nThe data corresponding to the request you submitted isn’t available immediately. After the status-check delay expires, make a `GET` request to [doc:\/\/org.swift.docc.AccountDataTransfer\/documentation\/AccountDataTransfer\/Get-one-time-request-status] or [doc:\/\/org.swift.docc.AccountDataTransfer\/documentation\/AccountDataTransfer\/Get-recurring-request-status], including the request identifier in the path.\n\nIf the job status is `completed` or `completed_with_error`, the data associated with the request is ready to download.\n\n### Transfer data\n\nGet the download URLs for a completed request by making a `GET` request to [doc:\/\/org.swift.docc.AccountDataTransfer\/documentation\/AccountDataTransfer\/Get-one-time-request-download-URLs] or [doc:\/\/org.swift.docc.AccountDataTransfer\/documentation\/AccountDataTransfer\/Get-recurring-request-download-URLs], including the request identifier in the path.\n\nThe response contains a list of URLs to which you make `GET` requests, to retrieve the person’s data.\n\nDownload URLs are available for 3 days after the download request completes. The URLs you receive are valid for 15 minutes after you request them.\n\nFor information on the content and terms used in the files you download, see [https:\/\/privacy.apple.com\/file-guides\/transfer\/accountdata].\n\n### Resubmit recurring requests\n\nEnqueue the next instance of a recurring request by making a `POST` request to the [doc:\/\/org.swift.docc.AccountDataTransfer\/documentation\/AccountDataTransfer\/Resubmit-request] endpoint, passing the parent request identifier and the request identifier of the most recent instance.\n\nThe server’s response contains the request identifier of the new request, and a delay to wait before you can check the new request’s status.",
