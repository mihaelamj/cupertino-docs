For auto-renewable subscription transactions, this value also appears in the `pending_renewal_info` key of the JSON response.\n\nYou can use this value to:\n\n- Match a transaction found in the receipt to a server-to-server notification event. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/enabling-app-store-server-notifications].\n- Manage auto-renewable subscriptions. Store this value, `product_id`, `expires_date_ms`, and `purchase_date_ms` for each transaction for each customer, as a best practice.\n- Identify a subscription with the `product_id` in the `pending_renewal_info` section. Do not rely on the `original_transaction_id` value on its own. Treat this purchase as a new subscription when you see a new `original_transaction_id` value for a `product_id`.\n- Differentiate a purchase transaction from a restore or a renewal transaction. In a purchase transaction, the `transaction_id` always matches the `original_transaction_id`. For subscriptions, it indicates the first subscription purchase. For a restore or renewal, the `transaction_id` does not match the `original_transaction_id`.\n- Identify one or more renewals for the same subscription.\n\n## Transaction identifiers\n\n- **transaction_id**: A unique identifier for a transaction, such as a purchase, restore, or renewal.\n- **app_account_token**: The UUID that an app optionally generates to map a customer’s in-app purchase with its resulting App Store transaction.\n\n",
