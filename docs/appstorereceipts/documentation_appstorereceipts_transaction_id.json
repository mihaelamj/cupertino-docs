Store the `transaction_id`, `original_transaction_id`, and `product_id` for each transaction, as a best practice to store transaction records for each customer. App Store generates a new value for `transaction_id` every time the subscription automatically renews or is restored on a new device.\n- Differentiate a purchase transaction from a restore or a renewal transaction. In a purchase transaction, the `transaction_id` always matches the `original_transaction_id`. For subscriptions, it indicates the first subscription purchase. For a restore or renewal, the `transaction_id` does not match the `original_transaction_id`. If a user restores or renews the same purchase multiple times, each restore or renewal has a different `transaction_id`.\n\n## Transaction identifiers\n\n- **original_transaction_id**: The transaction identifier of the original purchase.\n- **app_account_token**: The UUID that an app optionally generates to map a customer’s in-app purchase with its resulting App Store transaction.\n\n",
