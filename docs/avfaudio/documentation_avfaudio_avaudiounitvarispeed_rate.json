  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe varispeed audio unit resamples the input signal, and as a result, changing the playback rate also changes the pitch. For example, changing the rate to `2.0` results in the output audio playing one octave higher. Similarly changing the rate to `0.5`, results in the output audio playing one octave lower.\n\nThe audio unit measures the pitch in *cents*, a logarithmic value you use for measuring musical intervals. One octave is equal to 1200 cents. One musical semitone is equal to 100 cents.\n\nUsing the `rate` value you calculate the pitch (in cents) using the formula `pitch = 1200.0 * log2(rate)`. Conversely, you calculate the appropriate `rate` for a desired pitch with the formula `rate = pow(2, cents\/1200.0)`.\n\nThe default value is `1.0`. The range of values is `0.25` to `4.0`.",
