For best results, ensure that the language of an utterance’s text matches the voice for the utterance. The locale of a voice reflects regional variations in pronunciation or accent. For example, a voice with a language code of `en-US` speaks English text with a North American accent, and a language code of `en-AU` speaks English text with an Australian accent.",
