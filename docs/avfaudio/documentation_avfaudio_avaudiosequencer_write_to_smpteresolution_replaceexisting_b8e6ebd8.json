Passing zero uses the default value set using the tempo track.\n- **replace**: When `true`, the framework overwrites an existing file at `fileURL`. Otherwise, the call fails with a permission error if a file at the specified path exists.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe framework writes only MIDI events when writing to the MIDI file.
