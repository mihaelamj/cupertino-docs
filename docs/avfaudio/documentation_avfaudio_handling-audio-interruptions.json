  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nInterruptions are a common part of the iOS and watchOS user experiences. For example, consider the scenario of receiving a phone call while you’re watching a movie in the TV app on your iPhone. In this case, the movie’s audio fades out, playback pauses, and the sound of the call’s ringtone fades in. If you decline the call, control returns to the TV app, and playback begins again as the movie’s audio fades in.\n\nAt the center of this behavior is your app’s audio session. As interruptions begin and end, the audio session notifies any registered observers so they can take appropriate action. For example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer] monitors your app’s audio session and automatically pauses playback in response to interruption events. You can monitor these changes by key-value observing the player’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer\/timeControlStatus-swift.property] property, and update your user interface as necessary when the player pauses and resumes playback.\n\n### Customize the interruption behavior\n\nMost apps rely on the system’s default interruption behavior.

For example, consider the scenario of receiving a phone call while you’re watching a movie in the TV app on your iPhone. In this case, the movie’s audio fades out, playback pauses, and the sound of the call’s ringtone fades in.

However, [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfaudio\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession] provides ways to customize the default behavior to better accommodate your app’s needs:\n\n- Recent iPad models provide a feature that mutes the built-in microphone at the hardware level when the user closes the device’s Smart Folio cover. If your app plays and records audio, you may want to continue playback even if the system mutes the microphone. You can disable the default interruption behavior by setting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfaudio\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession\/CategoryOptions-swift.struct\/overrideMutedMicrophoneInterruption] option when configuring your audio session.\n- System alerts, such as receiving an incoming phone call, interrupt the active audio session. If you prefer that the system not interrupt your app’s audio session in these cases, you can indicate this preference by setting a value for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfaudio\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession\/setPrefersNoInterruptionsFromSystemAlerts(_:)] method.\n\n### Observe audio session interruptions\n\nYou can directly observe interruption notifications that [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfaudio\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession] posts.
