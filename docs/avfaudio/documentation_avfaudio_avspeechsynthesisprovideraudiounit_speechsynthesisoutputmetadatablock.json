In some cases, the system may delay speech output until it delivers these markers. For example, word highlighting depends on marker data from synthesizers to time what word to highlight. The array of markers can reference audio buffers that the system delivers at a later time.\n\nThere may be cases where a subclass doesn’t have marker data until it completes extra audio processing. If marker data changes, this block replaces that audio buffer range’s marker data.",
