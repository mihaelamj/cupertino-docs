This is specific to the classes [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfaudio\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioMixerNode] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfaudio\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioEnvironmentNode]. Effect nodes can’t talk to their downstream mixer.\n\nWhen connecting a source node, the properties that this protocol defines apply to the respective input bus of the mixer.\n\nYou can change the state of properties before connecting a source node to the mixer. The system caches your changes and applies them upon connection. It caches the properties again after disconnection.\n\nSource nodes maintain mixing settings when switching between different mixers. For example, an [doc:\/\/com.apple.avfaudio\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioPlayerNode], in a gaming scenario, can set up 3D mixing settings and then move from one environment to another.",
