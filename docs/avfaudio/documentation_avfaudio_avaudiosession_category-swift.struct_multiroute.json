For example, use this category to route audio to both a USB device and a set of headphones. Use of this category requires a more detailed knowledge of, and interaction with, the capabilities of the available audio routes.\n\n\n\n## Getting Standard Categories\n\n- **ambient**: The category for an app in which sound playback is nonprimary — that is, your app also works with the sound turned off.\n- **playAndRecord**: The category for recording (input) and playback (output) of audio, such as for a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) app.\n- **playback**: The category for playing recorded music or other sounds that are central to the successful use of your app.\n- **record**: The category for recording audio while also silencing playback audio.\n- **soloAmbient**: The default audio session category.\n- **audioProcessing**: The category for using an audio hardware codec or signal processor while not playing or recording audio.\n\n",
