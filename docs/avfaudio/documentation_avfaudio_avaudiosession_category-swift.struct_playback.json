(The switch is called the *Ring\/Silent switch* on iPhone.) To continue playing audio when your app transitions to the background (for example, when the screen locks), add the `audio` value to the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Reference\/InfoPlistKeyReference\/Articles\/iPhoneOSKeys.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/plist\/info\/UIBackgroundModes] key in your information property list file.\n\nBy default, using this category implies that your app’s audio is nonmixable—activating your session will interrupt any other audio sessions which are also nonmixable.
