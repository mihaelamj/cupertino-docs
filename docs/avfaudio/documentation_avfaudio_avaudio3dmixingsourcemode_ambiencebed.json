The audio channel layout of the bus specifies the directions of the input channels. The direction of the source node controls the rotation of the bed in the global space.\n\n## Source Modes\n\n- **AVAudio3DMixingSourceMode.spatializeIfMono**: A mono input bus that renders as a point source at the location of the source node.\n- **AVAudio3DMixingSourceMode.bypass**: A mode that does no spatial rendering.\n- **AVAudio3DMixingSourceMode.pointSource**: All channels of the bus render as a single source at the location of the source node.\n\n",
