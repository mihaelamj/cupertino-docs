To pair elements from multiple publishers, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/zip(_:)] instead. To receive just the most-recent element from multiple publishers rather than tuples, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/merge(with:)-7qt71].\n\nThe combined publisher passes through any requests to *all* upstream publishers. However, it still obeys the demand-fulfilling rule of only sending the request amount downstream. If the demand isn’t [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscribers\/Demand\/unlimited], it drops values from upstream publishers. It implements this by using a buffer size of 1 for each upstream, and holds the most-recent value in each buffer.\n\nIn this example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/PassthroughSubject] `pub1` and also `pub2` emit values; as [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/combineLatest(_:)] receives input from either upstream publisher, it combines the latest value from each publisher into a tuple and publishes it.\n\nWhen all upstream publishers finish, this publisher finishes.
