It uses a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/share()] operator to share the same random number to each of two subscribers. This example uses a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/delay(for:tolerance:scheduler:options:)] operator only to prevent the first subscriber from exhausting the sequence publisher immediately; an asynchronous publisher wouldn’t need this.\n\nWithout the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/share()] operator, stream 1 receives three random values, followed by stream 2 receiving three different random values.\n\nAlso note that [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publishers\/Share] is a class rather than a structure like most other publishers.
