After making this call, the publisher invokes the subscriber’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber\/receive(subscription:)] method. This gives the subscriber a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscription] instance, which it uses to demand elements from the publisher, and to optionally cancel the subscription. After the subscriber makes an initial demand, the publisher calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber\/receive(_:)], possibly asynchronously, to deliver newly-published elements. If the publisher stops publishing, it calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber\/receive(completion:)], using a parameter of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscribers\/Completion] to indicate whether publishing completes normally or with an error.\n\nCombine provides the following subscribers as operators on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher] type:",
