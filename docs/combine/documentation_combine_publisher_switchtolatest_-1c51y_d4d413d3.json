It switches the inner publisher as new ones arrive but keeps the outer publisher constant for downstream subscribers.\n\nWhen this operator receives a new publisher from the upstream publisher, it cancels its previous subscription. Use this feature to prevent earlier publishers from performing unnecessary work, such as creating network request publishers from frequently updating user interface publishers.",
