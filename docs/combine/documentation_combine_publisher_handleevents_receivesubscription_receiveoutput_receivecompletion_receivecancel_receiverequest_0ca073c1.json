This value defaults to `nil`.\n- **receiveOutput**: An optional closure that executes when the publisher receives a value from the upstream publisher. This value defaults to `nil`.\n- **receiveCompletion**: An optional closure that executes when the upstream publisher finishes normally or terminates with an error. This value defaults to `nil`.\n- **receiveCancel**: An optional closure that executes when the downstream receiver cancels publishing. This value defaults to `nil`.\n- **receiveRequest**: An optional closure that executes when the publisher receives a request for more elements. This value defaults to `nil`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA publisher that performs the specified closures when publisher events occur.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/handleEvents(receiveSubscription:receiveOutput:receiveCompletion:receiveCancel:receiveRequest:)] when you want to examine elements as they progress through the stages of the publisher’s lifecycle.\n\nIn the example below, a publisher of integers shows the effect of printing debugging information at each stage of the element-processing lifecycle:\n\n```swift\nlet integers = (0...2)\ncancellable = integers.publisher\n    .handleEvents(receiveSubscription: { subs in\n        print(\"Subscription: \\(subs.combineIdentifier)\")\n    }, receiveOutput: { anInt in\n        print(\"in output handler, received \\(anInt)\")\n    }, receiveCompletion: { _ in\n        print(\"in completion handler\")\n    }, receiveCancel: {\n        print(\"received cancel\")\n    }, receiveRequest: { (demand) in\n        print(\"received demand: \\(demand.description)\")\n    })\n    .sink { _ in return }\n\n\/\/ Prints:\n\/\/   received demand: unlimited\n\/\/   Subscription: 0x7f81284734c0\n\/\/   in output handler, received 0\n\/\/   in output handler, received 1\n\/\/   in output handler, received 2\n\/\/   in completion handler\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\n- **breakpoint(receiveSubscription:receiveOutput:receiveCompletion:)**: Raises a debugger signal when a provided closure needs to stop the process in the debugger.\n- **breakpointOnError()**: Raises a debugger signal upon receiving a failure.\n- **print(_:to:)**: Prints log messages for all publishing events.\n\n",
