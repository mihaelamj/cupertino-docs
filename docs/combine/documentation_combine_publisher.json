The subscriber’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber\/Input] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber\/Failure] associated types must match the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/Output] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/Failure] types declared by the publisher. The publisher implements the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/receive(subscriber:)]method to accept a subscriber.\n\nAfter this, the publisher can call the following methods on the subscriber:\n\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber\/receive(subscription:)]: Acknowledges the subscribe request and returns a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscription] instance. The subscriber uses the subscription to demand elements from the publisher and can use it to cancel publishing.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber\/receive(_:)]: Delivers one element from the publisher to the subscriber.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber\/receive(completion:)]: Informs the subscriber that publishing has ended, either normally or with an error.\n\nEvery `Publisher` must adhere to this contract for downstream subscribers to function correctly.\n\n\n\n### Using operators\n\nExtensions on `Publisher` define a wide variety of *operators* that you compose to create sophisticated event-processing chains. Each operator returns a type that implements the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher] protocol Most of these types exist as extensions on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publishers] enumeration. For example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/map(_:)-99evh] operator returns an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publishers\/Map].\n\nUse operators to assemble a chain of republishers, optionally ending with a subscriber, that processes elements produced by upstream publishers. Each operator creates and configures an instance of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscriber], and subscribes it to the publisher that you call the method on.\n\nIn the following example, a sequence publisher emits the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. A [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/filter(_:)] operator creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publishers\/Filter] publisher to only republish even values. A second operator creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscribers\/Sink] subscriber to print out each value received. The sink subscriber automatically subscribes to the filter publisher, at which point the filter publisher subscribes to its upstream publisher, the sequence publisher.\n\n```swift\nlet cancellable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].publisher\n    .filter {\n        $0 % 2 == 0\n    }\n    .sink {\n        print (\"Even number: \\($0)\")\n    }\n\/\/ Prints:\n\/\/ Even number: 2\n\/\/ Even number: 4\n```\n\n## Creating Your Own Publishers\n\nRather than implementing the `Publisher` protocol yourself, you can create your own publisher by using one of several types provided by the Combine framework:\n\n- Use a concrete subclass of [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subject], such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/PassthroughSubject], to publish values on-demand by calling its [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subject\/send(_:)] method.\n- Use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/CurrentValueSubject] to publish whenever you update the subject’s underlying value.\n- Add the `@Published` annotation to a property of one of your own types. In doing so, the property gains a publisher that emits an event whenever the property’s value changes. See the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Published] type for an example of this approach.\n\n## Declaring supporting types\n\n- **Output**: The kind of values published by this
