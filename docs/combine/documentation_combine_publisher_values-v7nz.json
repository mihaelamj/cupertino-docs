  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis property provides an [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/AsyncThrowingPublisher], which allows you to use the Swift `async`-`await` syntax to receive the publisher’s elements. Because [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/AsyncPublisher] conforms to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/AsyncSequence], you iterate over its elements with a `for`-`await`-`in` loop, rather than attaching a subscriber. If the publisher terminates with an error, the awaiting caller receives the error as a `throw`.\n\nThe following example shows how to use the `values` property to receive elements asynchronously. The example adapts a code snippet from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/tryFilter(_:)] operator’s documentation, which filters a sequence to only emit even integers, and terminate with an error on a `0`. This example replaces the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscribers\/Sink] subscriber with a `for`-`await`-`in` loop that iterates over the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/AsyncPublisher] provided by the `values` property. With this approach, the error handling previously provided in the sink subscriber’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscribers\/Sink\/receiveCompletion] closure goes instead in a `catch` block.",
