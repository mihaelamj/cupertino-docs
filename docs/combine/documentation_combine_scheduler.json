Individual scheduler implementations use whatever time-keeping system makes sense for them. Schedulers express this as their `SchedulerTimeType`. Since this type conforms to [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/SchedulerTimeIntervalConvertible], you can always express these times with the convenience functions like `.milliseconds(500)`. Schedulers can accept options to control how they execute the actions passed to them. These options may control factors like which threads or dispatch queues execute the actions.",
