  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nGiven a publisher that publishes [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher] instances, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publishers\/SwitchToLatest] publisher produces a sequence of events from only the most recent one. For example, given the type `AnyPublisher<URLSession.DataTaskPublisher,NSError>`, calling `switchToLatest()` results in the type `SwitchToLatest<(Data, URLResponse), URLError>`. The downstream subscriber sees a continuous stream of `(Data, URLResponse)` elements from what looks like a single [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSession\/DataTaskPublisher] even though the elements are coming from different upstream publishers.\n\nWhen [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publishers\/SwitchToLatest] receives a new publisher from the upstream publisher, it cancels its previous subscription. Use this feature to prevent earlier publishers from performing unnecessary work, such as creating network request publishers from frequently-updating user interface publishers.",
