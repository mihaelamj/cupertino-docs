This publisher requests a single value from the second publisher, and it ignores (drops) all elements from the upstream publisher until the second publisher produces a value.

If the upstream publisher acts on those requests before the other publisher produces an item, this publisher drops the elements it receives from the upstream publisher.\n\nIn the example below, the `pub1` publisher defers publishing its elements until the `pub2` publisher delivers its first element:\n\n```swift\nlet upstream = PassthroughSubject<Int,Never>()\nlet second = PassthroughSubject<String,Never>()\ncancellable = upstream\n    .drop(untilOutputFrom: second)\n    .sink { print(\"\\($0)\", terminator: \" \") }\n\nupstream.send(1)\nupstream.send(2)\nsecond.send(\"A\")\nupstream.send(3)\nupstream.send(4)\n\/\/ Prints \"3 4\"\n```\n\n## Applying sequence operations to elements\n\n- **dropFirst(_:)**: Omits the specified number of elements before republishing subsequent elements.\n- **drop(while:)**: Omits elements from the upstream publisher until a given closure returns false, before republishing all remaining elements.\n- **tryDrop(while:)**: Omits elements from the upstream publisher until an error-throwing closure returns false, before republishing all remaining elements.\n- **append(_:)**: Appends a publisher’s output with the specified elements.\n- **append(_:)**: Appends a publisher’s output with the specified sequence.\n- **append(_:)**: Appends the output of this publisher with the elements emitted by the given publisher.\n- **prepend(_:)**: Prefixes a publisher’s output with the specified values.\n- **prepend(_:)**: Prefixes a publisher’s output with the specified sequence.\n- **prepend(_:)**: Prefixes the output of this publisher with the elements emitted by the given publisher.\n- **prefix(_:)**: Republishes elements up to the specified maximum count.\n- **prefix(while:)**: Republishes elements while a predicate closure indicates publishing should continue.\n- **tryPrefix(while:)**: Republishes elements while an error-throwing predicate closure indicates publishing should continue.\n- **prefix(untilOutputFrom:)**: Republishes elements until another publisher emits an element.\n\n",
