The publisher sends the failure returned by this closure to the subscriber as the reason for termination.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA publisher that terminates if the specified interval elapses with no events received from the upstream publisher.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/timeout(_:scheduler:options:customError:)] to terminate a publisher if an element isn’t delivered within a timeout interval you specify.\n\nIn the example below, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/PassthroughSubject] publishes [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/String] elements and is configured to time out if no new elements are received within its `TIME_OUT` window of 5 seconds.
