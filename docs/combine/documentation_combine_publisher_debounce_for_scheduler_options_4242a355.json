This operator is useful to process bursty or high-volume event streams where you need to reduce the number of values delivered to the downstream to a rate you specify.\n\nIn this example, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/PassthroughSubject] publishes elements on a schedule defined by the `bounces` array. The array is composed of tuples representing a value sent by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/PassthroughSubject], and a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/TimeInterval] ranging from one-quarter second up to 2 seconds that drives a delivery timer. As the queue builds, elements arriving faster than one-half second `debounceInterval` are discarded, while elements arriving at a rate slower than `debounceInterval` are passed through to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/sink(receiveValue:)] operator.",
