Use `flatMap(maxPublishers:_:)` when you want to create a new series of events for downstream subscribers based on the received value. The closure creates the new [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher] based on the received value. The new [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher] can emit more than one event, and successful completion of the new [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher] does not complete the overall stream. Failure of the new [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher] causes the overall stream to fail.\n\nIn the example below, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/PassthroughSubject] publishes `WeatherStation` elements. The `flatMap(maxPublishers:_:)` receives each element, creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL] from it, and produces a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSession\/DataTaskPublisher], which will publish the data loaded from that [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL].",
