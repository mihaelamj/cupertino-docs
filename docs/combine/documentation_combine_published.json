You access the publisher with the `$` operator, as shown here:\n\nWhen the property changes, publishing occurs in the property’s `willSet` block, meaning subscribers receive the new value before it’s actually set on the property. In the above example, the second time the sink executes its closure, it receives the parameter value `25`. However, if the closure evaluated `weather.temperature`, the value returned would be `20`.\n\n### See Also",
