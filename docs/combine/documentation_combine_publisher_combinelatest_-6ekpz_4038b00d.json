However, it still obeys the demand-fulfilling rule of only sending the request amount downstream. If the demand isn’t `.unlimited`, it drops values from upstream publishers. It implements this by using a buffer size of 1 for each upstream, and holds the most-recent value in each buffer. All upstream publishers need to finish for this publisher to finish. If an upstream publisher never publishes a value, this publisher never finishes. If any of the combined publishers terminates with a failure, this publisher also fails.\n\nIn the example below, `combineLatest()` receives the most-recent values published by three publishers, multiplies them together, and republishes the result:",
