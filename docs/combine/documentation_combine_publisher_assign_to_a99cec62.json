The `assign(to:)` operator manages the life cycle of the subscription, canceling the subscription automatically when the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Published] instance deinitializes. Because of this, the `assign(to:)` operator doesn’t return an [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/AnyCancellable] that you’re responsible for like [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/assign(to:on:)] does.\n\nThe example below shows a model class that receives elements from an internal [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Timer\/TimerPublisher], and assigns them to a `@Published` property called `lastUpdated`. Because the `to` parameter has the `inout` keyword, you need to use the `&` operator when calling this method.\n\nIf you instead implemented `MyModel` with `assign(to: lastUpdated, on: self)`, storing the returned [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/AnyCancellable] instance could cause a reference cycle, because the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscribers\/Assign] subscriber would hold a strong reference to `self`. Using `assign(to:)` solves this problem.\n\nWhile the `to` parameter uses the `inout` keyword, this method doesn’t replace a reference type passed to it.
