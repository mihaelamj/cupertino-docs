To combine elements from multiple publishers, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/zip(_:_:_:)-16rcy] instead. To receive just the most-recent element from multiple publishers rather than tuples, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/merge(with:_:_:)].\n\nThe combined publisher passes through any requests to *all* upstream publishers. However, it still obeys the demand-fulfilling rule of only sending the request amount downstream. If the demand isn’t [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Subscribers\/Demand\/unlimited], it drops values from upstream publishers. It implements this by using a buffer size of 1 for each upstream, and holds the most-recent value in each buffer.\n\nAll upstream publishers need to finish for this publisher to finish. If an upstream publisher never publishes a value, this publisher never finishes.\n\nIn the example below, [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/combineLatest(_:_:_:)-48buc] receives input from any of the publishers, combines the latest value from each publisher into a tuple and publishes it:\n\nIf any individual publisher of the combined set terminates with a failure, this publisher also fails.",
