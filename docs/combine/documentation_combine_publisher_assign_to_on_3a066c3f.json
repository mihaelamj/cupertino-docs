See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Swift\/Conceptual\/Swift_Programming_Language\/Expressions.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40014097-CH32-ID563] in *The Swift Programming Language* to learn how to use key paths to specify a property of an object.\n- **object**: The object that contains the property. The subscriber assigns the object’s property every time it receives a new value.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/AnyCancellable] instance. Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Cancellable\/cancel()] on this instance when you no longer want the publisher to automatically assign the property. Deinitializing this instance will also cancel automatic assignment.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/assign(to:on:)] subscriber when you want to set a given property each time a publisher produces a value.\n\nIn this example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Combine\/documentation\/Combine\/Publisher\/assign(to:on:)] sets the value of the `anInt` property on an instance of `MyClass`:\n\n```swift\nclass MyClass {\n    var anInt: Int = 0 {\n        didSet {\n            print(\"anInt was set to: \\(anInt)\", terminator: \"; \")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nvar myObject = MyClass()\nlet myRange = (0...2)\ncancellable = myRange.publisher\n    .assign(to: \\.anInt, on: myObject)\n\n\/\/ Prints: \"anInt was set to: 0; anInt was set to: 1; anInt was set to: 2\"\n```\n\n\n\n## Connecting simple subscribers\n\n- **assign(to:)**: Republishes elements received from a publisher, by assigning them to a property marked as a publisher.\n- **sink(receiveCompletion:receiveValue:)**: Attaches a subscriber with closure-based behavior.\n- **sink(receiveValue:)**: Attaches a subscriber with closure-based behavior to a publisher that never fails.\n\n",
