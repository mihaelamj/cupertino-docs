To provide a consistent frame rate, the actual frame rate chosen is usually a factor of the maximum refresh rate of the screen. For example, if the maximum refresh rate of the screen is `60` frames per second, that’s also the highest frame rate the view sets as the actual frame rate. However, if you ask for a lower frame rate, the view might choose `30`, `20`, or `15` frames per second, or another factor, as the actual frame rate.\n\nYour application should choose a frame rate that it can consistently maintain. The default value is `60` frames per second.",
