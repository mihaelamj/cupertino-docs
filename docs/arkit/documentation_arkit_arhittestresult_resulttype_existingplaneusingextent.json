  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nWhen searching for this result type, ARKit returns a point coplanar with an already detected plane only if that point lies within the area defined by the plane’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARPlaneAnchor\/center] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARPlaneAnchor\/extent] properties. Those properties (together with the anchor’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARAnchor\/transform]) define the smallest rectangular area that includes all regions ARKit estimates to be a part of the plane.\n\nHowever, that rectangular area may contain regions that are not part of the same real-world surface. There may also be parts of the same real-world surface that lie outside the rectangle because ARKit has not yet recognized them as part of the same plane. You can get a more precise estimate of the plane area ARKit has recognized by testing with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARHitTestResult\/ResultType\/existingPlaneUsingGeometry] type, or extend your hit test to an infinite plane with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARHitTestResult\/ResultType\/existingPlane] type.\n\nAn existing plane search can return any number of results, depending on how many already-detected planes the hit test ray intersects (if any).",
