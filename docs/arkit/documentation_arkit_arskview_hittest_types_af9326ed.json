A 2D point in the view’s coordinate system can refer to any point along a 3D line that starts at the device camera and extends in a direction determined by the device orientation and camera projection. This method searches along that line, returning all objects that intersect it in order of distance from the camera.\n\nThe behavior of a hit test depends on which `types` you specify and the order you specify them in.
