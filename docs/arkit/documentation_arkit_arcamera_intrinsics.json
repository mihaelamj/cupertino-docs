You can use the matrix to transform 3D coordinates to 2D coordinates on an image plane.\n\n\n\nThe values `fx` and `fy` are the pixel focal length, and are identical for square pixels. The values `ox` and `oy` are the offsets of the principal point from the top-left corner of the image frame. All values are expressed in pixels.",
