Relative to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureVideoOrientation\/landscapeRight]-oriented camera image, the x-axis points to the right, the y-axis points up, and the z-axis points out the front of the device (toward the user).\n\nWhen this alignment is active, ARKit performs no device motion tracking. That is, world-space positions are effectively always relative to the current position and orientation of the device. (For example, a SceneKit object placed in an [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSCNView] will thus maintain the same position on screen, even as the camera image changes while the device moves.)",
