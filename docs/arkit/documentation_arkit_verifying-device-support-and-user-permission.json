Some ARKit features require later iOS versions or specific devices. ARKit also uses a device camera, so you need to configure iOS privacy controls so the user can permit camera access for your app.\n\nHow to handle device compatibility support depends on how your app uses ARKit:\n\n- **If the basic functionality of your app requires AR (using the back camera):** Add the `arkit` key in the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Reference\/InfoPlistKeyReference\/Articles\/iPhoneOSKeys.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40009252-SW3] section of your app’s `Info.plist` file. Using this key makes your app available only to ARKit-compatible devices.\n- **If augmented reality is a secondary feature of your app:** Check for whether the current device supports the AR configuration you want to use by testing the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARConfiguration\/isSupported] property of the appropriate [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARConfiguration] subclass.\n- **If your app uses face-tracking AR:** Face tracking requires the front-facing TrueDepth camera on iPhone X. Your app remains available on other devices, so you must test the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceTrackingConfiguration].[doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARConfiguration\/isSupported] property to determine face-tracking support on the current device.\n\n\n\n### Handle User Consent and Privacy\n\nFor your app to use ARKit, the user must explicitly grant your app permission for camera access. ARKit automatically asks the user for permission the first time your app runs an AR session.\n\niOS requires your app to provide a static message to be displayed when the system asks for camera or microphone permission.
