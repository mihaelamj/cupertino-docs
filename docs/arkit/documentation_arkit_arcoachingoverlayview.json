When you choose a specific goal like finding a plane, the view tailors its instructions accordingly. After the coaching overlay determines the goal has been met and no further coaching is required, it hides from the user’s view.\n\nFor an example app that uses the coaching overlay, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/placing-objects-and-handling-3d-interaction].\n\n### Supporting Automatic Coaching\n\nBy default, [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARCoachingOverlayView\/activatesAutomatically] is enabled and therefore you should override [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARCoachingOverlayViewDelegate\/coachingOverlayViewWillActivate(_:)] to determine whether coaching is in progress. Coordinate your actions to help the user focus on these instructions, for example, by hiding any UI that’s not necessary while the session reinitializes.\n\n### Relocalizing After an Interruption\n\nIf relocalization is enabled (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSessionObserver\/sessionShouldAttemptRelocalization(_:)]), ARKit attempts to restore your session if any interruptions degrade your app’s tracking state. In this event, the coaching overlay presents itself and gives the user instructions to assist ARKit with relocalizing.\n\n\n\nDuring this time, the coaching overlay includes a button that lets the user indicate they’d like to start over rather than restore the session.\n\n\n\nARKit notifies you when the user presses Start Over by calling your delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARCoachingOverlayViewDelegate\/coachingOverlayViewDidRequestSessionReset(_:)] function.
