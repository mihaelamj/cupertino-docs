  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nEach key in this dictionary (an [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceAnchor\/BlendShapeLocation] constant) represents one of many specific facial features recognized by ARKit. The corresponding value for each key is a floating point number indicating the current position of that feature relative to its neutral configuration, ranging from `0.0` (neutral) to `1.0` (maximum movement).\n\nYou can use blend shape coefficients to animate a 2D or 3D character in ways that follow the user’s facial expressions. ARKit provides many blend shape coefficients, resulting in a detailed model of a facial expression; however, you can use as many or as few of the coefficients as you desire to create a visual effect. For example, you might animate a simple cartoon character using only the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceAnchor\/BlendShapeLocation\/jawOpen], [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceAnchor\/BlendShapeLocation\/eyeBlinkLeft], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceAnchor\/BlendShapeLocation\/eyeBlinkRight] coefficients. A professional 3D artist could create a detailed character model rigged for realistic animation using a larger set, or the entire set, of coefficients.\n\nYou can also use blend shape coefficients to record a specific facial expression and reuse it later. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceGeometry] [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceGeometry\/init(blendShapes:)] initializer creates a detailed 3D mesh from a dictionary equivalent to this property’s value; the serialized form of a blend shapes dictionary is more portable than that of the face mesh those coefficients describe.",
