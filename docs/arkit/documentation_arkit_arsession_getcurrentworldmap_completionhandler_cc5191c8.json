With two devices tracking the same world map, you can build a networked experience where both users can see and interact with the same virtual content.\n- **Persistent AR experiences.** Save a world map when your app becomes inactive, then restore it the next time your app launches in the same physical environment. You can use  anchors from the resumed world map to place the same virtual content at the same positions from the saved session.\n\nBefore saving a world map, monitor the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFrame\/worldMappingStatus-swift.property] property to verify that ARKit has an adequate understanding of the user’s environment, ensuring that you can reliably make use of the saved map on a different device or at a later time.\n\nWorld map generation requires a world-tracking AR session.
