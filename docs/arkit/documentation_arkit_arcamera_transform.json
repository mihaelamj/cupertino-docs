In camera space, the x-axis points to the right when the device is in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDeviceOrientation\/landscapeLeft] orientation—that is, the x-axis always points along the long axis of the device, from the front-facing camera toward the Home button. The y-axis points upward (with respect to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDeviceOrientation\/landscapeLeft] orientation), and the z-axis points away from the device on the screen side.",
