For each key in the dictionary, the corresponding value is a floating point number indicating the current position of that feature relative to its neutral configuration, ranging from `0.0` (neutral) to `1.0` (maximum movement).\n\nARKit provides many blend shape coefficients, resulting in a detailed model of a facial expression; however, you can use as many or as few of the coefficients as you desire to create a visual effect. For example, you might animate a simple cartoon character using only the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceAnchor\/BlendShapeLocation\/jawOpen], [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceAnchor\/BlendShapeLocation\/eyeBlinkLeft], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARFaceAnchor\/BlendShapeLocation\/eyeBlinkRight] coefficients.
