You can then use this information to enhance the realism of your AR experience; for example, by placing certain virtual content only on floors.\n\nPlane classification can take longer than plane detection, and ARKit reports classifications only for planes where it has a high confidence in the result. If ARKit currently has no classification result for a plane, this property’s value is [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARPlaneAnchor\/Classification-swift.enum\/none(_:)], with an associated [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARPlaneAnchor\/Classification-swift.enum\/Status] value indicating why.\n\nPlane classification is available only on iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR.
