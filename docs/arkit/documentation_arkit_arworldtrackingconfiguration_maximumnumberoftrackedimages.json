ARKit checks for changes every frame.\n\nARKit tracks the first images it observes in the physical environment from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARWorldTrackingConfiguration\/detectionImages] set. When a session reaches the maximum number of tracked images, the framework attempts to track another member of the set only after one of the existing tracked images leaves the device’s view.\n\nThe default value is `0`, which disables image tracking.
