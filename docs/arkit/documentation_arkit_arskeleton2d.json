The joint locations are normalized within the range [0..1] in the coordinate space of the current frame’s camera image, where 0 is the upper left, and 1 is the bottom right.\n\nTo access a skeleton’s joints by name, you use [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSkeleton2D\/landmarkForJointNamed:]. To access a named joint by index (for example, for performance reasons), you query the definition for the named joint index using [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSkeletonDefinition\/index(for:)], then access [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSkeleton2D\/jointLandmarks-12vkw] using the resulting index.",
