  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nWhen ARKit loses track of the device’s position or orientation, ARKit calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSessionObserver\/sessionShouldAttemptRelocalization(_:)] to try to resume the experience where the user left off. This process is called *relocalization*. ARKit relocalizes when it loses access to the camera or other sensors on the device, such as when your app calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSession\/pause()], or when the user switches to another app and back.\n\nWhen relocalization succeeds, your app’s virtual content appears in the same position it was in before the interruption. But if your app fails to relocalize, the world coordinate system and anchor positions are likely out of sync with the real world.\n\nHere are the possible scenarios:\n\nWhen you return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], guide the user to facilitate relocalization; for example, by presenting a UI that asks them to return to their previous location. Relocalization works when ARKit recognizes the physical environment it observed before the interruption. If the user does not return to their previous location, the app stays in [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARCamera\/TrackingState-swift.enum\/Reason\/relocalizing] state indefinitely. It’s important to give the user a way to restart if they choose to. Using [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARCoachingOverlayView] makes much of this functionality available.\n\nTo respond to failed relocalization, call the session’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSession\/run(_:options:)] method with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSession\/RunOptions\/resetTracking] option. Resetting tracking during relocalization discards all world-tracking state from before the interruption, but keeps world-tracking results obtained during the relocalization attempt.",
