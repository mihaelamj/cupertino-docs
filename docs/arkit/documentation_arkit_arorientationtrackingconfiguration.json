  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAll AR configurations establish a correspondence between the real world the device inhabits and a virtual 3D coordinate space where you can model content. When your app displays that content together with a live camera image, the user experiences the illusion that your virtual content is part of the real world.\n\nCreating and maintaining this correspondence between spaces requires tracking the device’s motion. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/AROrientationTrackingConfiguration] class tracks the device’s movement with three degrees of freedom (3DOF): specifically, the three rotation axes (roll, pitch, and yaw).\n\nThis basic level of motion tracking can create limited AR experiences: A virtual object can appear to be part of the real world, even as the user rotates the device to look above, below, or beside that object. However, this configuration cannot track movement of the device: non-trivially changing the device’s position breaks the AR illusion, causing virtual content to appear to drift relative to the real world. For example, the user cannot walk around to see the sides and back of a virtual object. Additionally, 3DOF tracking does not support plane detection or hit testing.\n\n",
