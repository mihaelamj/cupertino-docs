If you create a location anchor without providing an altitude, ARKit defaults the altitude to ground level, and may query the server to check the topography at the anchor’s geographic coordinate. If the network is unavailable, ask the user to restore a connection by disabling Airplane Mode, enabling WiFi, or moving to a location that provides service. If the network is available but slow, an altitude query response may be delayed. Consider pausing a navigation or presenting visual feedback for the anchor’s tentative placement, such as by displaying a status indicator.\n- The location anchor is too far from the user. If users can create location anchors in your app, let them know to position the coordinates of each anchor within 0.05 degrees (~5 kilometers) of themselves and their device.\n- The server prevents the location anchor’s position, such as in a large body of water.\n\n## Creating a Geo Anchor\n\n- **init(coordinate:altitude:)**: Initializes a location anchor with the given coordinate and altitude.\n- **init(name:coordinate:altitude:)**: Initializes a named location anchor with the given coordinates and altitude.\n- **init(name:coordinate:altitude:)**: Initializes a named location anchor with the given coordinates and altitude.\n\n## Accessing Latitude and Longitude\n\n- **coordinate**: The lattitude and longitude of the anchor’s geographic location.\n\n## Defining Altitude\n\n- **altitude**: Vertical distance, in meters, between this anchor and sea level.\n- **altitudeSource**: A record of the source from which an altitude came.\n- **ARGeoAnchor.AltitudeSource**: Options for setting a location anchor’s altitude.\n\n## Geotracking\n\n- **Tracking geographic locations in AR**: Track specific geographic areas of interest and render them in an AR experience.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- ARAnchor\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- ARAnchorCopying\n- ARTrackable\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSCoding\n- NSCopying\n- NSObjectProtocol\n- NSSecureCoding\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
