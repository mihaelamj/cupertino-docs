The vector `(0,0,-1)` points to true north and the vector `(-1,0,0)` points west. (That is, the positive x-, y-, and z-axes point east, up, and south, respectively.)\n\n\n\nAlthough this option fixes the *directions* of the three coordinate axes to real-world directions, the *location* of the coordinate system’s origin is still relative to the device, matching the device’s position as of when the session configuration is first run.",
