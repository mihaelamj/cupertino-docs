When used in a renderer that supports environment-based lighting, spherical harmonics provide much less high-frequency detail than a cube map texture, but make much more efficient use of GPU resources.\n\nARKit provides second-level spherical harmonics in separate red, green, and blue data planes. Thus, this data buffer contains 3 sets of 9 coefficients, or a total of 27 values of 32-bit floating point type.",
