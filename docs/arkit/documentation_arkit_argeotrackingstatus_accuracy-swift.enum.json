When accuracy is [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARGeoTrackingStatus\/Accuracy-swift.enum\/low], the app needs to show content that’s more forgiving if ARKit is off by a small distance. For example, if accuracy is [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARGeoTrackingStatus\/Accuracy-swift.enum\/low], rendering a location anchor as a large ball several meters in the air is more appropriate than rendering an arrow that rests its point on a real-world surface. Because a larger ball isn’t meant to mark a precise location, any offset that results from low accuracy will be less noticeable to the user. Apps that need higher-precision location anchors need to wait for [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARGeoTrackingStatus\/Accuracy-swift.enum\/medium] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARGeoTrackingStatus\/Accuracy-swift.enum\/high] accuracy before revealing rendered location-anchors, or dismissing user instructions.",
