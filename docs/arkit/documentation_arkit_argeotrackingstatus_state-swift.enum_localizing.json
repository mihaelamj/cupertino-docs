To elicit the right user movements in [doc:\/\/com.apple.arkit\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARGeoTrackingStatus\/State-swift.enum\/localizing], the app needs to advise the user to:\n\n- Point the camera at buildings and other visual landmarks to help ARKit match the live camera data with its preexisting landscape-data.\n- Avoid pointing the device at objects that are too general, like trees. It’s better to focus on distinct visuals, like structures, or signs.\n- Avoid pointing the device at real-world objects that are transient, like parked cars, or a construction site.\n- Because lighting conditions can affect visual localization, avoid geo tracking at night.\n\n## States\n\n- **ARGeoTrackingStatus.State.initializing**: The session is initializing geo tracking.\n- **ARGeoTrackingStatus.State.localized**: Geo tracking is localized.\n- **ARGeoTrackingStatus.State.notAvailable**: Geo tracking is not available.\n- **ARGeoTrackingStatus.State.initializing**: The session is initializing geo tracking.\n- **ARGeoTrackingStatus.State.localized**: Geo tracking is localized.\n- **ARGeoTrackingStatus.State.notAvailable**: Geo tracking is not available.\n\n",
