  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA packet trace is a record of traffic traveling across the network. It’s useful for investigating complex network problems related to both correctness and performance.\n\nOnce you start a packet trace on a network interface, it records all traffic passing through that interface until you stop the trace. Packet traces are usually quite short — perhaps recording the traffic associated with one specific connection — but there are situations where you might want to run the trace for hours or even days.\n\nBoth macOS and iOS have built-in support for packet traces. This article explains how to record a packet trace on both platforms. Even if your primary focus is iOS, you should start by running some tests on macOS to familiarize yourself with the tools before you attempt to debug your actual problem.\n\n### Choose the Correct Interface\n\nThe first step in recording a packet trace on the Mac is to choose the correct interface. If you choose the wrong interface, you may end up recording an empty packet trace. For example, if you use the `en0` interface on a Mac that has built-in Ethernet but is connected to the Internet over Wi-Fi, your packet trace will include all the traffic over the built-in Ethernet, that is, nothing.\n\nDetermine the correct interface name by running the `networksetup` command-line tool with the `-listallhardwareports` argument. This prints a list of network interfaces, including both the user-visible name and the short interface name needed by packet trace tools. For example:\n\nIn this example, the built-in Ethernet is `en0` and the built-in Wi-Fi is `en1`, but this will change from machine to machine. Look through this list for the user-visible name of the interface you want to trace (these match the names shown in Network preferences), then use the associated short interface name.\n\n### Record and Analyze a Packet Trace on a Mac\n\nWorking with packet traces usually involves recording a packet trace to a file and analyzing that file. It’s possible to do both steps at once, and it’s a good idea to do that when you’re just getting started. The following Terminal command starts a packet trace and prints information about each packet as it’s transferred.\n\nIn this example:\n\nWhen you run `tcpdump` in this way, you see something like this:\n\nThere’s a line of output for each packet seen on the network. On each line there’s a timestamp and a lot of information about that packet. This specific example shows the start of a connection from an SSH client at 192.168.1.187 to an SSH server listening on port 22 of 192.168.1.39.\n\nPacket traces can be quite overwhelming. Rather than trying to interpret the packet trace in real time, use the `-w` option to write the trace to a file and then do your analysis later on.\n\nThis example records a packet trace and writes the results to a file call `trace.pcap`. You can save that file to analyze later on using `tcpdump` itself, or one of the tools listed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.network\/documentation\/Network\/taking-advantage-of-third-party-network-debugging-tools]. You can also submit it to Apple for analysis (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.network\/documentation\/Network\/submitting-a-packet-trace-to-apple]).\n\nIf you’re having problems recording a packet trace, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.network\/documentation\/Network\/troubleshooting-packet-traces].\n\n### Set Up iOS Packet Tracing\n\niOS doesn’t let you record a packet trace directly. However, you can use your Mac to record a packet trace on an attached iOS device using the Remote Virtual Interface (RVI) mechanism. To get started, first connect your iOS device to your Mac via USB. Next run the `rvictl` command in Terminal.\n\nIn this example:\n\nThis command prints the following output.\n\nThis output includes the interface name of the newly-created RVI, `rvi0` in this example. Supply this interface name to your favorite packet trace tool to record a trace of the traffic on your iOS device. For example, use the following command to record a packet trace on `rvi0` and write it to `trace.pcap`.\n\nIf you’re having problems working with RVIs, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.network\/documentation\/Network\/troubleshooting-packet-traces] for some troubleshooting tips.\n\n### Display and Filter iOS Interface Information\n\nAn RVI represents the entire networking stack of the iOS device; you cannot target a specific interface on the device as you would on the Mac. However, information about the interface is recorded in the packet metadata. You can use your packet trace tool to display the interface for each packet and filter the trace based on that interface. For the `tcpdump` tool, use the -k option to display packet metadata and tcpdump -Q to filter on it. The `tcpdump` man page has the details; see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/os\/reading-unix-manual-pages].",

It’s possible to do both steps at once, and it’s a good idea to do that when you’re just getting started. The following Terminal command starts a packet trace and prints information about each packet as it’s transferred.\n\n```shell\nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -n\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `tcpdump` is the name of macOS’s built-in packet trace tool.\n- The `sudo` command causes `tcpdump` to run with privileges, which is necessary in order to record packets.\n- The `-i en0` option tells `tcpdump` to record packets on the default Ethernet-like interface. Replace `en0` with the short interface name you determined in [doc:\/\/com.apple.network\/documentation\/Network\/recording-a-packet-trace#Choose-the-Correct-Interface].\n- The `-n` option tells tcpdump not to attempt to use reverse DNS to map IP addresses to names; such mapping is rarely useful on the modern Internet and it radically slows things down.\n\nWhen you run `tcpdump` in this way, you see something like this:\n\n```shell\n17:49:26.500970 IP 192.168.1.187.64917 > 192.168.1.39.22: Flags [S], seq 3769365868, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 5,nop,nop,TS val 1478872373 ecr 0,sackOK,eol], length 0\n17:49:26.503325 IP 192.168.1.39.22 > 192.168.1.187.64917: Flags [S.], seq 405178393, ack 3769365869, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 5,nop,nop,TS val 72353448 ecr 1478872373,sackOK,eol], length 0\n17:49:26.503413 IP 192.168.1.187.64917 > 192.168.1.39.22: Flags [.], ack 1, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 1478872375 ecr 72353448], length 0\n17:49:26.504887 IP 192.168.1.39.22 > 192.168.1.187.64917: Flags [.], ack 1, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 72353449 ecr 1478872375], length 0\n17:49:26.526134 IP 192.168.1.39.22 > 192.168.1.187.64917: Flags [P.], seq 1:22, ack 1, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 72353470 ecr 1478872375], length 21\n17:49:26.526228 IP 192.168.1.187.64917 > 192.168.1.39.22: Flags [.], ack 22, win 4117, options [nop,nop,TS val 1478872396 ecr 72353470], length 0\n```\n\nThere’s a line of output for each packet seen on the network. On each line there’s a timestamp and a lot of information about that packet. This specific example shows the start of a connection from an SSH client at 192.168.1.187 to an SSH server listening on port 22 of 192.168.1.39.\n\nPacket traces can be quite overwhelming. Rather than trying to interpret the packet trace in real time, use the `-w` option to write the trace to a file and then do your analysis later on.\n\n```shell\nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -w trace.pcap\n```\n\nThis example records a packet trace and writes the results to a file call `trace.pcap`. You can save that file to analyze later on using `tcpdump` itself, or one of the tools listed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.network\/documentation\/Network\/taking-advantage-of-third-party-network-debugging-tools].

This UDID is just an example; you can find your device’s UDID in the Devices and Simulators window in Xcode.\n\nThis command prints the following output.\n\n```shell\n$ rvictl -s b0e8fe73db17d4993bd549418bfbdba70a4af2b1\n\nStarting device b0e8fe73db17d4993bd549418bfbdba70a4af2b1 [SUCCEEDED] with interface rvi0\n```\n\nThis output includes the interface name of the newly-created RVI, `rvi0` in this example.
