However, in some cases that’s not practical, so you have to run your tool on a different machine entirely. When doing so, be aware of these challenges:\n\n- The target interface must support promiscuous mode, that is, the ability to record packets that aren’t destined for that interface. Most Ethernet interfaces support promiscuous mode. Most Wi-Fi interfaces also support promiscuous mode, but that’s not useful because of network topology restrictions. Other interface types typically don’t support promiscuous mode.\n- The network topology must allow the interface to see the packets. Historically, you could ensure this by connecting your machines using a hub. However, hubs are almost unheard of these days: Your DSL gateway might claim to have “an embedded four-port hub”, but actually that’s a switch.\n- By default, switches don’t forward all traffic to all ports. If you have a simple switch, there’s no way to override this default. For promiscuous mode to be useful, you’ll need an advanced switch that supports port mirroring, that is, the ability to forward all traffic to a specific port.\n- If you’re trying to use promiscuous mode on Wi-Fi, be aware that Wi-Fi access points act like switches, with standard traffic being seen only by the stations involved and the access point. Only a low-level Wi-Fi packet trace can take advantage of Wi-Fi promiscuous mode; see [doc:\/\/com.apple.network\/documentation\/Network\/recording-a-wi-fi-packet-trace#Record-Low-Level-Details-of-Wi-Fi-Traffic-Management].\n\n### Get More Hints from the Wireshark Wiki\n\nThe [https:\/\/wiki.wireshark.org\/] has some useful information about how to set up your packet tracing environment:\n\n- The [https:\/\/wiki.wireshark.org\/CaptureSetup\/Ethernet] page contains background information on how to set up your network for monitoring.\n- The [https:\/\/wiki.wireshark.org\/HubReference] page contains information on various types of hubs.\n- The [https:\/\/wiki.wireshark.org\/SwitchReference] page contains information on analysis features, such as port mirroring, found on various models of switches, including links to online documentation for those switches.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Reading UNIX Manual Pages**: Use the Terminal app to read the documentation for low-level UNIX tools and APIs.\n\n## Working with Packet Traces\n\n- **Recording a Wi-Fi Packet Trace**: Record traces of Wi-Fi traffic and traffic management.\n- **Submitting a Packet Trace to Apple**: Learn the best way to record a packet trace when communicating with Apple.\n\n",
