That’s the easiest solution. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.network\/documentation\/Network\/recording-a-packet-trace] for instructions.\n- If your Wi-Fi access point supports bridge mode (notably, all Apple base stations do), you can bridge the Wi-Fi network on to an Ethernet network and then use standard Ethernet techniques to capture a packet trace. You won’t be able to see Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi traffic, but in many situations that’s not a problem.\n- If you enable Internet Sharing on your Mac, and have your Wi-Fi clients join the shared network, you can run your packet trace program on the Mac and see all the Wi-Fi traffic. If you target the Mac’s Wi-Fi interface, you will see all traffic, including Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi traffic. If you target the Mac’s Ethernet interface, you will only see traffic entering or leaving the Wi-Fi network.\n\n### Record Low-Level Details of Wi-Fi Traffic Management\n\nIf you are interested in the low-level details of how the Wi-Fi network manages traffic, record a low-level Wi-Fi packet trace. To do this:\n\n1. Choose a Mac on which to record your trace. That Mac cannot use the Wi-Fi interface for normal network traffic while recording the trace.\n2. Configure your access point to use a fixed channel. When recording a packet trace, you must specify the channel to record, and having the access point choose its channel automatically makes that harder.\n3. Either temporarily turn off the Wi-Fi password on your network or use a separate test network that has no password. If the Wi-Fi network has a password, Wi-Fi encryption makes it harder to examine the trace.\n4. Open the Wireless Diagnostics app (you can find this in `\/System\/Library\/CoreServices\/Applications\/`).\n5. Choose Window > Sniffer.\n6. In the Sniffer window, select the channel number and width you want to record and click Start.\n7. Click Stop when you’re done.\n8. In the Finder, navigate to `\/var\/tmp\/` and look for the resulting `.pcap` file.\n\n## Working with Packet Traces\n\n- **Troubleshooting Packet Traces**: Take action to address packet tracing problems.\n- **Submitting a Packet Trace to Apple**: Learn the best way to record a packet trace when communicating with Apple.\n\n",
