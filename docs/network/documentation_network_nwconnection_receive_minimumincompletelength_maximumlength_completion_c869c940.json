The completion indicates that the requested content has been received (in which case the content is delivered), or that an error has occurred.\n\nThe completion delivers the received content, which may be nil if the message is complete or an error occurred, the message context, a flag indicating if the message is complete, and any associated error.\n\n## Sending and Receiving Data\n\n- **send(content:contentContext:isComplete:completion:)**: Sends data on a connection.\n- **send(content:contentContext:isComplete:completion:)**: Sends data on a connection using a custom Data type.\n- **NWConnection.SendCompletion**: A completion handler that indicates when the connection has finished processing sent content.\n- **receiveMessage(completion:)**: Schedules a single receive completion handler for a complete message, as opposed to a range of bytes.\n- **batch(_:)**: Defines a block in which calls to send and receive are processed as a batch to improve performance.\n- **NWConnection.ContentContext**: An object that represents a message to send or receive, containing protocol metadata and send properties.\n- **maximumDatagramSize**: The maximum size of a datagram message that can be sent on a connection.\n\n",
