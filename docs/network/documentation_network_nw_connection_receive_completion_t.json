This may be nil if the message or stream is complete (without any more data to deliver), or if an error was encountered.\n- **context**: Content context describing the received content. This includes protocol metadata that lets the caller introspect information about the received content (such as flags on a packet).\n- **is_complete**: An indication that this context (a message or stream, for example) is now complete. For protocols such as TCP, this will be marked when the entire stream has be closed in the reading direction. For protocols such as UDP, this will be marked when the end of a datagram has been reached.\n- **error**: An error will be sent if the receive was terminated before completing. There may still be content delivered along with the error, but this content may be shorter than the requested ranges. An error will be sent for any outstanding receives when the connection is cancelled.\n\n## Data Types\n\n- **nw_advertise_descriptor_t**: A description used to advertise the Bonjour service that a listener provides.\n- **nw_browse_descriptor_t**: A service description used to discover Bonjour services.\n- **nw_browse_result_change_t**: Flags describing ways in which discovered services can change between specific results.\n- **nw_browse_result_enumerate_interface_t**: A handler that enumerates the interfaces associated with a discovered service.\n- **nw_browse_result_t**: A discovered service and metadata about the service.\n- **nw_browser_browse_results_changed_handler_t**: A handler that delivers updates about discovered services.\n- **nw_browser_state_changed_handler_t**: A handler that delivers browser state updates with associated errors.\n- **nw_browser_t**: An object you use to browse for available network services.\n- **nw_connection_boolean_event_handler_t**: A handler that receives Boolean state updates from a connection, such as viability and better path state.\n- **nw_connection_group_new_connection_handler_t**\n- **nw_connection_group_receive_handler_t**: A handler that receives inbound messages from members of the group.\n- **nw_connection_group_send_completion_t**: A completion to notify you when data has been processed and sent.\n- **nw_connection_group_state_changed_handler_t**: A handler that receives connection group state updates.\n- **nw_connection_group_t**: An object you use to communicate with a group of endpoints, such as an IP multicast group on a local network.\n- **nw_connection_path_event_handler_t**: A handler that delivers network path updates.\n\n",
