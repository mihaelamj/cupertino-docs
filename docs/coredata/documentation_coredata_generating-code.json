Select an entity from the Entities list.\n2. In the Data Model inspector, below Class, the Codegen pop-up menu offers three options: Manual\/None, Class Definition, and Category\/Extension.\n\n\n\nThe sections that follow describe circumstances for choosing each option.\n\n#### Automatically Generate Both Files\n\nChoose Class Definition when you don’t need to edit the properties or functionality of the managed object subclass and properties files that Core Data generates for you.\n\nThe generated source code doesn’t appear in your project’s source list. Xcode produces the class and properties files as part of the build process and places them in your project’s build directory.\n\nThese files regenerate whenever the related entity changes in the data model.\n\n#### Generate the Properties File Only\n\nChoose Category\/Extension to add additional convenience methods or business logic inside your managed object subclass.\n\nThis option allows you take full control of the class file, while continuing to automatically generate the properties file to keep it up-to-date with the model editor. It’s up to you to create and maintain your class manually.\n\nTo generate the class file initially, do the following:\n\n1. From the Xcode menu bar, choose Editor > Create NSManagedObject Subclass.\n2. Select your data model, then the appropriate entity, and choose where to save the files. Xcode places both class and properties files into your project.\n3. Because the build process continues to generate the properties file, move this duplicate file from your project source list to the Trash.\n\nYou can now see and edit the class file in your project source list.\n\n\n\n#### Manage Both Files Manually\n\nChoose Manual\/None to edit the properties in your managed object subclass, for example, to alter access modifiers, and to add additional convenience methods or business logic.\n\nUsing this option, Core Data doesn’t generate any files to support your managed object. You create and maintain your class, including its properties, manually. Core Data then locates these files using the values you supply in the class name and module fields.\n\nTo generate the class and properties files initially:\n\n1.
