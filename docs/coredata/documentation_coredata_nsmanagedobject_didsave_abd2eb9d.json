Moreover, if the object’s context has an undo manager, such changes will add an undo operation. For document-based applications, changes made in `didSave` will therefore come into the next undo grouping, which can lead to “empty” undo operations from the user’s perspective. You may want to disable undo registration to avoid this issue.\n\nThe sense of “save” in the method name is that of a database commit statement and so applies to deletions as well as to updates to objects. For subclasses, this method is therefore an appropriate locus for code to be executed when an object deleted as well as “saved to disk.” You can find out if an object is marked for deletion with [doc:\/\/com.apple.coredata\/documentation\/CoreData\/NSManagedObject\/isDeleted].\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nYou cannot attempt to resurrect a deleted object in `didSave`.",
