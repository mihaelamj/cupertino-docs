If an error occurs, returns `nil`. If no objects match the criteria specified by `request`, returns an empty array.\n\n## Discussion\n\nReturned objects are registered with the receiver.\n\nThe following points are important to consider:\n\nObjects that have been realized (populated, faults fired, “read from”, and so on) as well as pending updated, inserted, or deleted, are never changed by a fetch operation without developer intervention. If you fetch some objects, work with them, and then execute a new fetch that includes a superset of those objects, you do not get new instances or update data for the existing objects—you get the existing objects with their current in-memory state.",

If an error occurs, returns `nil`. If no objects match the criteria specified by `request`, returns an empty array.\n\n## Discussion\n\nReturned objects are registered with the receiver.\n\nThe following points are important to consider:\n\n- If the fetch request has no predicate, then all instances of the specified entity are retrieved, modulo other criteria below.\n- An object that meets the criteria specified by `request` (it is an instance of the entity specified by the request, and it matches the request’s predicate if there is one) and that has been inserted into a context but which is not yet saved to a persistent store, is retrieved if the fetch request is executed on that context.\n- If an object in a context has been modified, a predicate is evaluated against its modified state, not against the current state in the persistent store. Therefore, if an object in a context has been modified such that it meets the fetch request’s criteria, the request retrieves it even if changes have not been saved to the store and the values in the store are such that it does not meet the criteria. Conversely, if an object in a context has been modified such that it does not match the fetch request, the fetch request will not retrieve it even if the version in the store does match.\n- If an object has been deleted from the context, the fetch request does not retrieve it even if that deletion has not been saved to a store.\n\nObjects that have been realized (populated, faults fired, “read from”, and so on) as well as pending updated, inserted, or deleted, are never changed by a fetch operation without developer intervention. If you fetch some objects, work with them, and then execute a new fetch that includes a superset of those objects, you do not get new instances or update data for the existing objects—you get the existing objects with their current in-memory state.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Core Data Programming Guide**\n- **Predicate Programming Guide**\n- **Core Data Snippets**\n\n## Registering and fetching objects\n\n- **fetch(_:)**: Returns an array of items of the specified type that meet the fetch request’s critieria.\n- **count(for:)**: Returns the number of objects the specified request fetches when it executes.\n- **registeredObject(for:)**: Returns an object that exists in the context.\n- **object(with:)**: Returns either an existing object from the context or a fault that represents that object.\n- **existingObject(with:)**: Returns an existing object from either the context or the persistent store.\n- **registeredObjects**: The set of registered managed objects in the context.\n- **count(for:)**: Returns a count of the objects the specified request fetches when it executes.\n- **execute(_:)**: Passes a request to the persistent store without affecting the contents of the managed object context, and returns a persistent store result.\n- **refreshAllObjects()**: Refreshes all of the registered managed objects in the context.\n- **retainsRegisteredObjects**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the context keeps strong references to all registered managed objects.\n\n",
