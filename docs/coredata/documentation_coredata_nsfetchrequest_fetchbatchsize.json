A batch size of `0` is treated as infinite, which disables the batch fetching behavior.\n\nIf you set a nonzero batch size, the collection of objects returned when an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.coredata\/documentation\/CoreData\/NSFetchRequest] is executed is broken into batches. When the fetch is executed, the entire request is evaluated and the identities of all matching objects recorded, but only data for objects up to the `batchSize` will be fetched from the persistent store at a time. The array returned from executing the request is a proxy object that transparently fetches subsequent batches on demand. (In database terms, this is an in-memory cursor.)\n\nYou can use this feature to restrict the working set of data in your application. In combination with [doc:\/\/com.apple.coredata\/documentation\/CoreData\/NSFetchRequest\/fetchLimit], you can create a subrange of an arbitrary result set.\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nFor purposes of thread safety, when the fetch is executed, consider the array proxy returned as being owned by the managed object context the request is executed against. Treat the array proxy as if it were a managed object registered with that context.",
