An application protects a critical section of code by requiring a thread to acquire a lock before executing the code. Once the critical section is past, the thread relinquishes the lock by invoking [doc:\/\/com.apple.coredata\/documentation\/CoreData\/NSManagedObjectContext\/unlock()].\n\nSending this message to a managed object context helps the framework to understand the scope of a transaction in a multi-threaded environment. It is preferable to use the `NSManagedObjectContext`’s implementation of `NSLocking` instead using of a separate mutex object.\n\nIf you lock (or successfully `tryLock`) a managed object context, the thread in which the lock call is made must keep a strong reference to the context until it invokes unlock, otherwise if the context is deallocated this will result in deadlock.",
