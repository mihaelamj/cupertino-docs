If you invoke a primitive accessor on an unmodeled property, it will instead operate upon a random modeled property. (The debug libraries and frameworks from (available from the [http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/]) have assertions to test for passing unmodeled keys to these methods.)\n- You are strongly encouraged to use the dynamically-generated accessors rather than using this method directly (for example, `setPrimitiveName:` instead of `setPrimitiveValue:newName forKey:@\"name\"`). The dynamic accessors are much more efficient, and allow for compile-time checking.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **awakeFromFetch()**: Provides an opportunity to add code into the life cycle of the managed object when fufilling it from a fault.\n\n## Supporting Key-Value Coding\n\n- **value(forKey:)**: Returns the value for the property specified by `key`.\n- **setValue(_:forKey:)**: Sets the specified property of the managed object to the specified value.\n- **primitiveValue(forKey:)**: Returns the value for the specified property from the managed object’s private internal storage .\n- **objectIDs(forRelationshipNamed:)**: Returns the object IDs for all of the managed objects that are in the named relationship.\n\n",
