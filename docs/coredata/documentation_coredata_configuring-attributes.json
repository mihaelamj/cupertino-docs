With an entity selected, click Add Attribute at the bottom of the editor area. A new attribute with the placeholder name `attribute`, of type `Undefined`, appears in the Attributes list.\n2. In the Attributes list, double-click the newly added attribute, and rename it.\n3. In the Attributes list, as shown in the second screenshot, click `Undefined` and choose the attribute’s data type from the Type pop-up menu.\n\n\n\n### Configure Attributes\n\nUse the data model inspector (choose View > Inspectors > Show Data Model Inspector) to configure attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the full list of types, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.coredata\/documentation\/CoreData\/NSAttributeType].\n\n\n\nCore Data optionals aren’t the same as Swift optionals.
