For example, it contains items from Apple Music, songs purchased from iTunes Store, and imports from discs and other apps. This library can include content that’s not in the Apple Music Catalog.\n\nUse this API to retrieve information about albums, songs, artists, playlists, music videos, Apple Music stations, ratings, charts, recommendations, and the user’s most-recently played content. With proper authorization from the user, you can also create or modify playlists and apply ratings to the user’s content.\n\n\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Generating Developer Tokens**: Generate a
