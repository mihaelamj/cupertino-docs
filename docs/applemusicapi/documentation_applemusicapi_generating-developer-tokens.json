The header of every Apple Music API request requires a signed developer token.\n\nThere are two paths to generate developer tokens:\n\n- If you’re developing an app for Apple platforms (iOS, tvOS, watchOS or macOS), the recommended way to integrate with Apple Music is to use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MusicKit] for Swift, following the steps provided in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MusicKit\/Using-Automatic-Token-Generation-for-Apple-Music-API].\n- Follow the directions below to create and manage developer tokens for other platforms.\n\n### Create a Developer Token\n\nA developer token is a signed token used to authenticate a developer in Apple Music requests. [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/configure-app-capabilities\/create-a-media-identifier-and-private-key\/] allows you to use a developer token to authenticate yourself as a trusted developer and member of the Apple Developer Program.\n\nThe Apple Music API supports the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification, so you can pass statements and metadata called *claims*. For more information, see the [https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519] and the available libraries for generating signed JWTs.\n\nConstruct a developer token as a JSON object whose header contains:\n\n- The algorithm (`alg`) you use to sign the token, which should have a value of `ES256`\n- A 10-character key identifier (`kid`) key, obtained from your developer account\n\n\n\nIn the *claims* payload of the token, include:\n\n- The *issuer* (`iss`) registered claim key, whose value is your 10-character Team ID, obtained from your developer account\n- The *issued at* (`iat`) registered claim key, whose value indicates the time at which the token was generated, in terms of the number of seconds since epoch, in UTC\n- The *expiration time* (`exp`) registered claim key, whose value must not be greater than `15777000` (6 months in seconds) from the current Unix time on the server\n- Optional, but recommended for web clients, use the *origin claim* (`origin`). Only use this JWT if the origin header of the request matches one of the values in the array. This addition helps prevent unauthorized use of the tokens. For example: “`origin`”`:[`”`https:\/\/example.com`”`,`”`https:\/\/music.example.com`”`]`.\n\n\n\nA decoded developer token has the following format.\n\n```other\n{\n     \"alg\": \"ES256\",\n     \"kid\": \"ABC123DEFG\"\n}\n{\n     \"iss\": \"DEF123GHIJ\",\n     \"iat\": 1437179036,\n     \"exp\": 1493298100\n}\n```\n\nAfter you create the token, sign it with your MusicKit private key using the ES256 algorithm.\n\n\n\n### Authorize Requests\n\nA developer token is used to authorize all Apple Music API requests. If you manage this directly, in all requests, pass the `Authorization: Bearer` header set to the developer token.\n\n```other\ncurl -v -H 'Authorization: Bearer [developer token]' \"https:\/\/api.music.apple.com\/v1\/test\"\n```\n\nTo sign in and authenticate requests for an Apple Music subscriber, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.applemusicapi\/documentation\/AppleMusicAPI\/user-authentication-for-musickit]. For more information about requests, responses, and error handling, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.applemusicapi\/documentation\/AppleMusicAPI\/handling-requests-and-responses].\n\n### Request Rate Limiting\n\nApple Music API limits the number of requests your app can make using a developer token within a specific period of time. If this limit is exceeded, you’ll temporarily receive `429 Too Many Requests` error responses for requests that use the token. This error resolves itself shortly after the request rate has reduced.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **User Authentication for MusicKit**: Authenticate requests for user data using the Music User Token.\n- **Handling Requests and Responses**: Write a request and handle responses from the API.\n- **Handling Resource Representation and Relationships**: Fetch resources with extended attributes and included relationships and relationship views.\n- **Storefronts and Localization**: Pick a region-specific geographic location from which to retrieve catalog information, or retrieve information from the user’s personal library.\n- **Common Objects**: Understand the common JSON objects that framework responses contain.\n- **Managing Content Ratings, Alternate Versions, and Equivalencies**: Handle multiple and alternate versions of content.\n- **Fetching Resources by Page**: Use pagination to fetch the next set of objects.\n\n",
