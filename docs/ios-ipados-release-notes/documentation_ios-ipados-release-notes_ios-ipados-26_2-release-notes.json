The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 26.2, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 26.2, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-26_2-release-notes].\n\n### AirDrop\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Devices set to “Everyone” on 26.2 beta 1 are not discoverable by devices on 26.2 beta 2.  (163636875)\n\n**Workaround:** Update both devices to 26.2 beta 2 or ensure the devices have each other’s Apple account email or phone number in their Contacts.\n\n### HealthKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Hypertension notifications are now available for reading with a new API. Your app can now request authorization for `HKCategoryTypeIdentifierHypertensionEvent` to read notifications resulting from the Hypertension Notifications Feature on Apple Watch.  (153344834)\n\n### Instruments\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The Allocations instrument sometimes fails to report reference counting operations for native Swift types.  (163080666)\n\n### PermissionKit API\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- PermissionKit Significant App Update API is not testable in sandbox.  (163601229)\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/storekit\/appstore\/ageratingcode] API provides the current age rating code for your app. Use this property to fetch the age rating and compare it with the last known rating to check for changes.  (160960740)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: An issue prevents the purchase of a subscription using a win-back offer when testing with StoreKit Testing in Xcode.  (162357552) (FB20604848)\n- Fixed: `SubscriptionStatus.all` returning old `SubscriptionStatus` after a subscription change.  (163505178)\n\n### TLS\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The default TLS Client Hello has been modified. If your app or website communicates with servers configured with strict bot-detection or security policies that only allow traffic with known TLS fingerprints, then users might be unable to login or perform other actions.\n\nTLS Client Hellos are expected to change across releases as Apple works to offer the most secure TLS options. Servers should adopt resilient and adaptable bot-detection policies that can handle changes in TLS Client Hellos. Overly restrictive policies can cause difficult to triage disruptions to user experience.  (163151032)\n\n### Watch Face Gallery\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Watch Face Gallery text is in English only.  (164187878)\n\n## iOS & iPadOS 26\n\n- **iOS & iPadOS 26.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **iOS & iPadOS 26 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
