The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 16.4, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 16.4, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-16_4-release-notes].\n\n### Apple Vision Pro app\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: On iOS 18.4 beta 1, the Apple Vision Pro app launches with a black screen if downloaded from the App Store. Upgrade to iOS 18.4 beta 2 and newer, and the app will launch as expected.  (146814396)\n\n### Broadcast Extensions\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Broadcast extensions now have a higher per-process memory limit. This should enable capturing & streaming content at higher quality, if the system resources are available.  (144104867)\n\n### hvf\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Availability checking is disabled for C APIs in hvf.  (148385341)\n\n### Security\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Some enterprise apps might not launch. If you experienced this issue on iOS 18 or later, uninstall all enterprise apps from the device and reinstall them.  (147965052)\n\n### Siri\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Siri requests to play a song in Apple Music might fail across multiple platforms.  (149392508)\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Calling `isEligibleForIntroOffer(for:)` will return false if there is no user account signed in.  (146119524)\n\n### Writing Tools\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Resolved an issue where the attributes in the NSAttributedString passed in `writingToolsCoordinator(_:replace:in:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)` (or its companion async form) are stripped when an `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` or `UIWritingToolsCoordinator` has `resultOptions` set to `[.plainText]`. The attributes are no longer stripped but instead use the same attributes as were included by the delegate in the `NSAttributedString` returned in `writingToolsCoordinator(_:requestsContextsFor:completion:)` (or its companion async form).
