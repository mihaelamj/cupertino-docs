The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.1 RC, available from [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/download\/]. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.1, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-14_1-release-notes].\n\n### Home\n\n#### Known issues\n\n- You might receive an alert to turn on Wi-Fi when pairing a Matter accessory. (98460235)\n\n**Workaround:** Ensure your device is connected to your Wi-Fi network.\n- Adjusting the color or color temperature might result in an unexpected color set on a Matter accessory. (98578966)\n- Accessory details might not open if a Matter accessory is unreachable. (99232316)\n- The device that initiates the pairing needs to use the same iCloud account as the home hub. Only the owner of a home, not an invited user, can pair Matter accessories. (76012945)\n\n### Memory Allocation\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The system memory allocator `free` operation zeroes out all deallocated blocks in iOS 16.1 beta or later. Invalid accesses to free memory might result in new crashes or corruption, including:\n\n- Read-after-free bugs that previously observed the old contents of a block may now observe zeroes instead\n- Write-after-free bugs may now cause subsequent calls to `calloc` to return non-zero memory\n\nTo debug these issues, use Address Sanitizer and Guard Malloc (see `libgmalloc(3)`). (97449075)\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue where restoring transactions wouldn’t prompt for authentication or restore any transactions if there was no App Store account signed in. (99506258)\n\n- Fixed an issue where purchasing or restoring in-app transactions with hosted content would block new purchases or restores from processing. (100117681)\n\n## iOS & iPadOS 16\n\n- **iOS & iPadOS 16.6 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **iOS & iPadOS 16.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **iOS & iPadOS 16.4 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **iOS & iPadOS 16.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **iOS & iPadOS 16.2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **iOS 16 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **iPadOS 16 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
