The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 26.1, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 26.1, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-26_1-release-notes].\n\n### AirDrop\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The AirDrop icon in the iOS share sheet has some visual defects at the corners.  (158979986)\n\n### Background Assets\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `AssetPackManager.url(for:)` unexpectedly throws an error when looking up the URL for a locally available asset file.  (157959878) (FB19512759)\n\n### Game Controller\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The time returned by `GCPressedStateInput.lastPressedStateTimestamp` is not in the correct time domain.  (159124910)\n\n### HealthKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- HealthKit authorization UI now displays a single Blood Pressure switch to control changes to Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure type authorizations. The API is unchanged and apps should request for both types in code.  (153579893)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `HKCorrelation` objects of type `.bloodPressure` fail to save with `errorInvalidArgument` HKError code if they don’t have exactly one systolic and one diastolic blood pressure quantity sample its set of objects.  (151889745)\n\n### Instruments\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Processor Trace Instrument doesn’t allow for recording on iPhone 17 family of devices.  (161440613)\n\n### Keyboard\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: You are unable to select diacritical marks and character variants with keyboard. The base character is inserted instead of the intended variant.  (159398021)\n\n### Lock Screen\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Devices might sleep unexpectedly while using certain apps on the Lock Screen (Calculator, Timer, Notes).  (162150524)\n\n### NearbyInteraction\n\n#### New Features\n\n- `NINearbyAccessoryConfiguration` now supports additional UWB parameters such as hopping mode.  (157879907)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Running an `NISession` with an `NIDLTDOAConfiguration` results in an error.  (151352056)\n\n### Siri\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Questions related to News in Portuguese might fall back to Web search or ChatGPT.  (153935878)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Siri Voice preview might default to legacy pt-BR voices, rather than new pt-PT options.  (155929981)\n\n**Workaround:** Select Voice 2 as your new Siri voice. Ask Siri a question, and you will hear the new pt-PT offering.\n- The initial pt-PT Siri Voices have pronunciation and word stress issues. Your feedback is appreciated.  (160205691)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### New Features\n\n- `@Animatable` macro is now available starting with iOS 13, macOS 10.15, tvOS 13, and watchOS 6.  (158895616)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Buttons that do not specify an explicit label display text instead of a symbol in toolbars.  (157671221)\n- Fixed: The `navigationLinkIndicatorVisibility` modifier crashes when run on iOS 17, iOS 18 and aligned releases.\n\nYou must recompile your app against the 26.1 SDK to receive this fix.  (158236264) (FB19613386)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- On iOS and iPadOS, `@FocusState` doesn’t work in `safeAreaBar`.  (158720838)\n\n### UIKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- UIDocument was incorrectly annotated to be main actor only. This has been corrected. As a result you might see new warnings or errors show up in your Swift code using UIDocument.  (149990945)\n\n### WebKit\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- WebKit outputs a crash stacktrace to `stderr` when `decidePolicyFor navigationAction` returns `.cancel`.  (156957269)\n\n**Workaround:** This trace does not represent a bug in the application, and can be safely ignored.\n\n## iOS & iPadOS 26\n\n- **iOS & iPadOS 26.2 Beta 3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **iOS & iPadOS 26 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
