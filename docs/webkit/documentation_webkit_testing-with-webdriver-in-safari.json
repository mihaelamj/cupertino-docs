When a test calls a command, the command is executed in the following steps:\n\n1. The client library translates each command into a REST API command.\n2. The REST API command sends the corresponding HTTP request to a local web server hosted by Safari’s driver.\n3. The driver validates the HTTP request’s contents and forwards the command to the appropriate browser instance.\n4. When a command has finished executing, the driver sends an HTTP response for the REST API command. The client library interprets the HTTP response and returns the result to the test code.\n\n### Make Sure You Have Safari’s WebDriver\n\nSafari and Safari Technology Preview each provide their own `safaridriver` executable. Make sure you already have the executable on your device:\n\n- Safari’s executable is located at `\/usr\/bin\/safaridriver`.\n- Safari Technology Preview’s executable is part of the application bundle’s contents.\n\nEach `safaridriver` is capable of launching only the Safari version it’s associated with, and the two can run simultaneously. Although you can launch `safaridriver` manually by running a `safaridriver` executable, most Selenium libraries launch the driver automatically. See the documentation for your preferred client library to learn how to specify which browser to use.\n\n### Get the Correct Selenium Library Version\n\nGrab a recent release of the [https:\/\/www.seleniumhq.org\/download\/] open source project. Selenium’s Java and Python client libraries offer support for Safari’s native driver implementation starting in the 3.0.0-beta1 release.\n\n\n\n### Configure Safari to Enable WebDriver Support\n\nSafari’s WebDriver support for developers is turned off by default. How you enable it depends on your operating system.\n\n**High Sierra and later:**\n\nRun `safaridriver --enable` once. (If you’re upgrading from a previous macOS release, you may need to use `sudo`.)\n\n**Sierra and earlier:**\n\n1. If you haven’t already done so, make the Develop menu available. Choose Safari > Preferences, and on the Advanced tab, select “Show Develop menu in menu bar.” For details, see [https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/safari\/welcome].\n2. Choose Develop > Allow Remote Automation.\n3. Authorize `safaridriver` to launch the XPC service that hosts the local web server. To permit this, manually run `\/usr\/bin\/safaridriver` once and follow the authentication prompt.\n\n### Write a WebDriver Testing Suite\n\nOnce you’ve obtained a client library, you can write a WebDriver test and run it against Safari.
