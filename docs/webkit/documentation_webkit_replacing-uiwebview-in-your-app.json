Choose among several technologies, based on your app’s functionality and the degree of configurability you need. This article explores some alternatives and specifically the configuration and architectural changes of [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView].\n\n### Consider alternative technologies\n\nBefore beginning a migration away from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWebView], consider whether it can be replaced with other tools. Apple has a variety of technologies that can replace a web view to accomplish similar functionality, and possibly a richer feature set with less code.\n\nIf you need an in-app web browser and don’t need deep customization of that experience, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SafariServices\/SFSafariViewController] is a good choice. It handles all the features you’d need to implement in a basic browser and more.\n\nIf you need to authenticate your users, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASWebAuthenticationSession].\n\nIf you need to display maps or map tiles, consider using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MapKit\/MKMapView].\n\n### Update to WKWebView\n\nIf you need a high degree of configurability or are using web content in ways unrelated to browsing, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView].\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView] isn’t a drop-in replacement for [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWebView]. It has a different architecture that requires rethinking how you use web views, as well as code changes to implement its functionality. You may not be able to implement some features in [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView].\n\n### Implement delegates for functionality\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView] uses various delegates to implement functionality that’s similar to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWebViewDelegate]. The table below shows the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWebViewDelegate] methods and their [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView] equivalents in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKNavigationDelegate] column.\n\n### Plan for architectural changes\n\nOne major architectural difference between [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWebView] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView] is that the methods of [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView] tend to be asynchronous, while the methods of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWebView] were synchronous.\n\nThis difference requires code and architecture changes in your app. Another major change relates to creating single sign on (SSO) functionality. Cookie restrictions across the entire [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView] landscape, mean SSO functionality in [doc:\/\/com.apple.webkit\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView] isn’t supported for third-party cookies and clients should use a token-based authentication system like OAuth for SSO. Third-party cookies are cookies for a domain other than the domain for which the context was loaded. APIs in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices] framework are specifically built to do this.",
