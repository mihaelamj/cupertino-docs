By adopting universal links and adding a Shared with You shelf to your app, you can also share your content using Messages.

This adds a new level of collaboration to your app. You can customize your content’s contextual menu to add even more functionality to shared content.\n\n### Adopt universal links\n\nYour app uses universal links to share content with other apps.
