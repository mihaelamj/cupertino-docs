Add this button to your SwiftUI user interface in situations when users may want to grant temporary access to their location data each time they use a particular feature of your app.\n\n\n\nThe first time a user taps this button, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreLocation] asks the user to confirm that they’re comfortable using this UI element when they want to grant temporary access to their location data. If the user agrees, the app receives temporary [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLAuthorizationStatus\/authorizedWhenInUse] authorization, like when the user chooses *Allow Once* in response to your app’s standard location authorization request. This temporary authorization expires when your app is no longer in use.\n\nAfter the user agrees to using `LocationButton`, the button becomes approved to request future authorizations without displaying an additional alert to the user. The next time the user taps it, this button simply grants one-time authorization without requiring confirmation.\n\nAfter you receive this temporary authorization, fetch the user’s location using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreLocation] API and perform any app-specific tasks related to that location data. Connect the button to initiate the tasks you want to perform after getting authorization by specifying an action when you create the button. Keep in mind that this action activates every time the user taps this button, regardless of whether the app already has location authorization.\n\nCreate a `LocationButton` in SwiftUI like this:\n\nConfigure the button to display an icon, a label, or both using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/labelStyle(_:)] view modifier. If you include an icon, you can customize its appearance using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/symbolVariant(_:)] modifier. For design guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/ios\/app-architecture\/accessing-user-data\/].",
