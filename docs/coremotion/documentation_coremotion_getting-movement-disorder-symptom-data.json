To preserve battery life, the manager doesn’t perform calculations in real time. Instead, it periodically and opportunistically analyzes the raw data, saving the results on the user’s device. To preserve disk space, the manager only keeps results for seven days. During this time, you can use the manager to query for the results.\n\nFor more information about the scientific validation and algorithms behind disorder detection and recording, see [http:\/\/stm.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/13\/579\/eabd7865?ijkey=Md\/cIhqXrFvws&keytype=ref&siteid=scitransmed], or download a PDF from [https:\/\/stm.sciencemag.org\/content\/scitransmed\/13\/579\/eabd7865.full.pdf?ijkey=Md\/cIhqXrFvws&keytype=ref&siteid=scitransmed].\n\nApps that use the `CMMovementDisorderManager` must:\n\nTo retrieve Parkinson’s tremors or dyskinetic symptoms data from a watchOS app:\n\n### Provide the motion usage description\n\nYour watchOS app must provide an [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Reference\/InfoPlistKeyReference\/Articles\/CocoaKeys.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/plist\/info\/NSMotionUsageDescription] key with a `String` value in the WatchKit extension’s `Info.plist` file.
