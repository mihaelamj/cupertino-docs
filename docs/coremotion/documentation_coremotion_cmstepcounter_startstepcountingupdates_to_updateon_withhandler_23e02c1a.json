  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis method initiates tracking of the user’s steps and calls the provided block periodically to deliver the results. When you call this method, the step counter resets the current step count value to 0 and begins counting. Each time the step counter records the number of steps in the `stepCounts` parameter, it executes the specified `handler` block. For example, if `stepCounts` is 100, it would send updates at 100 steps, 200 steps, 300 steps, and so on. The number of steps reported to your handler is always the total number of steps since you called this method.\n\nThe `handler` block is executed on a best effort basis each time the step count threshold is exceeded. If your app is suspended when the threshold is exceeded, the block is not executed. When your app resumes, the block is not executed until the threshold is exceeded again.\n\nTo stop the delivery of step-counting updates, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremotion\/documentation\/CoreMotion\/CMStepCounter\/stopStepCountingUpdates()] method. Updates also stop when the step counter object itself is deallocated.",

You can specify a custom queue or use the operation queue associated with your app’s main thread. This parameter must not be `nil`.\n- **stepCounts**: The number of steps to record before executing the `handler` block. The number of steps must be greater than 0.\n- **handler**: The block to execute when the number of steps has been reached or exceeded. For information about the parameters of this block, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremotion\/documentation\/CoreMotion\/CMStepUpdateHandler]. This property must not be `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method initiates tracking of the user’s steps and calls the provided block periodically to deliver the results.
