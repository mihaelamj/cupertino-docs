However, the measurement updates include only surface pressure and submersion state data. After submersion, the measurement updates include depth and water pressure data. The watch also begins receiving water temperature updates.\n\nThe system sends measurement and temperature updates three times a second while the watch is submerged. When the watch is on the surface, the system provides updates at a slower rate, and may stop providing updates if the watch isn’t moving.",
