Using the `CMFallDetectionManager`, your app can request the user’s authorization, and set up a delegate to receive notifications about these *fall detection events*. For more information, see [https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT208944].\n\n`CMFallDetectionManager` requires an entitlement from Apple. To apply for the entitlement, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/contact\/request\/fall-detection-api]. This entitlement allows the app to run in the background without requiring any additional capabilities. However, you can add capabilities for other background modes, as needed by your app.\n\nThere are two approaches to detecting falls in your app. You can either query for [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityTypeIdentifier\/numberOfTimesFallen] samples in HealthKit, or you can use Core Motion’s `CMFallDetectionManager`.\n\n### Detect and Respond to Falls\n\nThe Core Motion fall detection manager is particularly useful for apps that need to respond to falls in a timely manner so that the app can provide help to the person who fell.\n\nThe fall detection manager:\n\n### Detect and Monitor Falls Over Time\n\nThe HealthKit sample is particularly useful for apps that monitor falls over longer time periods, because there can be a delay between the fall event and HealthKit updating its samples.\n\nHealthKit provides:\n\n### Create the Manager\n\nTo receive fall detection notifications, ensure that the feature is available on the current device.

The system may not instantiate your app’s user interface when launching your app in the background, so you can’t set the delegate from your user interface code, such as when an interface controller activates, or in response to a change in SwiftUI’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ScenePhase] state.\n\n### Request User Authorization\n\nAfter your user interface loads, check if you previously requested approval.

If the system finds an event, it calls your delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremotion\/documentation\/CoreMotion\/CMFallDetectionDelegate\/fallDetectionManager(_:didDetect:completionHandler:)] method and passes the most recent event. On subsequent launches, as long as your app remains authorized and the system has detected a recent fall event, the system calls `fallDetectionManager(_:didDetect:completionHandler:)` as soon as you set the delegate.\n\nThe system also wakes your app in the background to respond to any new fall detection events.
