Upon calling this method, the motion activity manager executes the `handler` block on the specified `queue`, reporting the current motion in effect for the device. After that, the motion activity manager executes the `handler` block only when the motion data changes.\n\nThe `handler` block is executed on a best effort basis and updates are not delivered while your app is suspended. If updates arrived while your app was suspended, the last update is delivered to your app when it resumes execution. To get all of the updates that occurred while your app was suspended, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremotion\/documentation\/CoreMotion\/CMMotionActivityManager\/queryActivityStarting(from:to:to:withHandler:)] method.\n\nUpon starting activity updates, the motion activity manager reports changes to its block until you call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremotion\/documentation\/CoreMotion\/CMMotionActivityManager\/stopActivityUpdates()] method. If you call this method again with a new block, the activity manager stops delivering updates to the old block and delivers them to the new block instead. Updates stop altogether when the motion activity manager object itself is deallocated.",

You can specify a custom queue or use the operation queue associated with your app’s main thread. This parameter must not be `nil`.\n- **handler**: The block to execute when a change in the current type of motion is detected.
