The two choices are:\n\nYou can create a temporal denoised scaler instance that can denoise and upscale textures at its best speed immediately after you create it by setting this property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] and then calling an initialization method like [doc:\/\/com.apple.metalfx\/documentation\/MetalFX\/MTLFXTemporalDenoisedScalerDescriptor\/makeTemporalDenoisedScaler(device:)]. However, it may take MetalFX more time for that method to return while it creates the denoiser scaler and compiles its underlying pipelines.\n\nBy default, the property is equal to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], which tells MetalFX to quickly create and return the temporal scaling-effect instance, and then compile a faster upscaler in the background. However, this means the effect can take more time to upscale textures while the framework compiles the underlying upscaler. When the framework finishes compiling, the effect runs just as fast as if you set the property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true].",
