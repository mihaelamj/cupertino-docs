Tapping the button lets the user revert to authentication using the device passcode or password instead.\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.localauthentication\/documentation\/LocalAuthentication\/LAContext\/localizedFallbackTitle] property to set a title for the fallback button. When the property is `nil`—as it is by default—the user sees an appropriate default title, like “Use Passcode”. Otherwise, provide a localized string that’s short and clear.\n\nTo eliminate the fallback option, set the fallback title to an empty string. This hides the button from the interface.",
