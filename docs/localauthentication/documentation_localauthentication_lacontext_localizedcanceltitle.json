The button appears every time the system asks the user to present a finger registered with Touch ID. For Face ID, the button only appears if authentication fails and the user is prompted to try again. Either way, the user can stop trying to authenticate by tapping the button.\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.localauthentication\/documentation\/LocalAuthentication\/LAContext\/localizedCancelTitle] property to choose a title for the cancel button. If you set the property to `nil`—as it is by default—or assign an empty string, the system uses an appropriate default title, like “Cancel”. Otherwise, provide a localized string that’s short and clear.",
