For possible values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.localauthentication\/documentation\/LocalAuthentication\/LAPolicy].\n- **localizedReason**: The app-provided reason for requesting authentication, which displays in the authentication dialog presented to the user.\n- **reply**: A closure that is executed when policy evaluation finishes. This is evaluated on a private queue internal to the framework in an unspecified threading context. You must not call [doc:\/\/com.apple.localauthentication\/documentation\/LocalAuthentication\/LAContext\/canEvaluatePolicy(_:error:)] in this block, because doing so could lead to deadlock.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n\nThis method asynchronously evaluates an authentication policy.
