Evaluation also fails after too many failed Touch ID attempts. After failed Face ID attempts, the system offers a fallback option, but stops trying to authenticate with Face ID. Both Touch ID and Face ID authentication are disabled system-wide after too many consecutive unsuccessful attempts, even when the attempts span multiple evaluation calls. When this happens, the system requires the user to enter the device passcode to reenable biometry.\n\nDuring authentication, the system presents the user with an authentication dialog for every attempt to authenticate with Touch ID, or after any failed Face ID attempt. The dialog contains a cancel button with a title that you can customize by setting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.localauthentication\/documentation\/LocalAuthentication\/LAContext\/localizedCancelTitle] property. If the user taps the cancel button, the policy evaluation fails with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.localauthentication\/documentation\/LocalAuthentication\/LAError-swift.struct\/userCancel] error.\n\nThe authentication dialog also displays a fallback button after too many unsuccessful Touch ID or Face ID attempts.
