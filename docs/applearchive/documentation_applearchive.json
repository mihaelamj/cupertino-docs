Apple Archive offers these features:\n\n- Multithreaded processing that uses all cores, is energy efficient, and yields faster results\n- An ability to transport files and their attributes and use Apple File System (APFS) features when they’re available, for example, filesystem compression, full clones, and sparse files\n- Flexible encoding formats, so you can use archives, for example, for error correction, digests, manifests, and external data storage\n- API support for in-memory archive processing, streaming access, random access, and back-to-back archive and extraction\n\n## Apple Archive essentials\n\n- **Compressing single files**: Compress a single file and store the result on the file system.\n- **Decompressing single files**: Recreate a single file from a compressed file.\n- **Compressing file system directories**: Compress the contents of an entire directory and store the result on the file system.\n- **Decompressing and extracting an archived directory**: Recreate an entire file system directory from an archive file.\n- **Compressing and saving a string to the file system**: Compress the contents of a Unicode string and store the result on the file system.\n- **Decompressing and parsing an archived string**: Recreate a string from an archive file.\n\n## Apple Encrypted Archive essentials\n\n- **Encrypting and Decrypting a String**: Encrypt the contents of a string and save the result to the file system, then decrypt and recreate the string from the archive file using Apple Encrypted Archive.\n- **Encrypting and Decrypting a Single File**: Encrypt a single file and save the result to the file system, then decrypt and recreate the original file from the archive file using Apple Encrypted Archive.\n- **Encrypting and Decrypting Directories**: Compress and encrypt the contents of an entire directory or decompress and decrypt an archived directory  using Apple Encrypted Archive.\n- **ArchiveEncryptionContext**: An object that encapsulates all parameters, keys, and data necessary to open an encrypted archive for both encryption and decryption streams.\n\n## Apple Archive headers\n\n- **ArchiveHeader**: An AppleArchive entry header.\n\n## Apple Archive streams\n\n- **ArchiveStreamProtocol**: A set of methods that defines the interface for using an archive stream that reads from and writes to data blobs.\n- **ArchiveStream**: An archive stream that reads from and writes to data blobs\n- **ArchiveByteStreamProtocol**: A set of methods that defines the interface for using an archive stream that reads from and writes to buffers.\n- **ArchiveByteStream**: An archive stream that reads from and writes to buffers.\n\n## Apple Archive errors\n\n- **ArchiveError**: Error codes for AppleArchive.\n\n## Constants\n\n- **APPLE_ARCHIVE_API_VERSION**: The version of the framework at compile time.\n\n## Reference\n\n- **Apple Archive structures**\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **About Apple File System**: Use high-level APIs to get the most out of Apple File System.\n\n",
