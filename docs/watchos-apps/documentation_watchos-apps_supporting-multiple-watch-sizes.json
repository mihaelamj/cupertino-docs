  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen designing your app, be sure to support all available Apple Watch sizes to ensure a consistent experience for everyone who uses your app. For more information on Apple Watch screen dimensions, refer to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/layout#watchOS-device-screen-dimensions] in the Human Interface Guidelines. For information about adopting Liquid Glass in watchOS, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/TechnologyOverviews\/adopting-liquid-glass].\n\nWhere possible, use resizable objects to fill the available space. Resizable objects help you create flexible layouts and minimize the amount of customization you need to support for the different sizes. If necessary, you can customize your layout for specific sizes; however, when creating the layout for larger screens, use the additional space to display larger controls and assets, rather than filling the screen with additional controls. For additional design information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/designing-for-watchos].\n\n### Use safe areas and scene padding\n\nMost watches have rounded corners that may clip scrolling content. Some also bend content around the bevel, which can affect the appearance of anything placed near the sides. Each screen keeps a margin between the text in its status and navigation bars, and the edge of the screen. When you lay out content, align text with the leading edge of the navigation bar’s title or Back button, and with the trailing edge of the status bar’s text.\n\nThe system provides the following tools to help you manage your content:\n\nApple Watch uses system-defined safe areas to keep content from getting too close to the edge of the screen. By default, SwiftUI views fill the safe area: scrolling content, such as list views, automatically settle within the safe areas. Override the safe area only when necessary, such as when you need content like background images or colors to extend to the screen edges. To disable the safe area, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/ignoresSafeArea(_:edges:)] view modifier. However, keep most interactive content within the safe area for optimal usability.\n\nThe following example demonstrates extending a background image to fill the entire screen while keeping text readable within the safe area:\n\nTo align items with the status and navigation bar, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/scenePadding(_:)] on your view. Apply scene padding when you want your text and interactive elements to align with the system’s standard margins. This is particularly important for text heavy content where it can enhance readability. The following example shows text alignment using scene padding:\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Button]  to automatically align with the text margins. The rounded rectangle for a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List] horizontally fills the safe area, but its content aligns with the status and navigation bar. For additional design information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/layout].\n\n### Support Dynamic Type\n\nUse Dynamic Type so the wearer can modify the size of text components in your app. Dynamic Type helps people who need larger text for better readability. It also accommodates those who can read smaller text, allowing more information to appear on the screen. Apps that support Dynamic Type provide an experience that’s consistent with the system apps. For more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Applying-Custom-Fonts-to-Text].\n\nDifferent watch sizes use different default Dynamic Type sizes:\n\n### Manage assets\n\nTo provide an asset that adapts to all watch sizes, create a scalable PDF asset. Add a PDF to the asset catalog as a 2x image asset, then set its Auto Scaling attribute to Automatic.\n\n\n\nWhen you load the PDF, the system scales the image based on the current device’s size as listed in the table below.\n\nFor more design information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/images].\n\n### Preview multiple sizes\n\nWhen designing a watchOS app, you can use Xcode previews to check your app’s layout. You can display one or more previews using the `#Preview` macro.\n\nYou can then use the Preview destination picker to switch between different devices.\n\n\n\nYou can also view all the Dynamic Type sizes for that device by selecting the Dynamic Type Variants option in Xcode. For more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/previewing-your-apps-interface-in-xcode].\n\n",
