If you want both a watchOS and an iOS app that deliver related experiences, either create a new watchOS app with a companion iOS app or add a watchOS target to an existing iOS project.\n\n### Create a new watchOS project\n\nTo create a new watchOS project:\n\n\n\n### Add a watchOS target to an existing iOS app\n\nTo add a watchOS target to an existing iOS project:\n\n",

In Xcode, choose File > New > Project.\n2. Select the watchOS tab.\n3. Select the App icon and click Next.\n4. In the project options sheet, enter a name for the project. To create a watch-only app, select “Watch-only App.” To create both a watchOS app and an iOS app, select “Watch App with New Companion iOS App.” Then click Next.\n5. Select a location for the project and click Create.\n\n\n\n### Add a watchOS target to an existing iOS app\n\nTo add a watchOS target to an existing iOS project:\n\n1. Select the project in the Project navigator.\n2. Click the “Add a target” button in the Project editor.\n3. Select the watchOS tab.\n4. Select the App icon and click Next.\n5. In the project option sheet, enter a name for the watchOS app, and select “Watch app for Existing iOS App.” Make sure to select the correct iOS app in the pull-down menu, and click Finish.\n\n\n\n## Information property list keys\n\n- **WKWatchKitApp**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the bundle is a watchOS app.\n- **WKAppBundleIdentifier**: The bundle ID of the watchOS app.\n- **WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier**: The bundle ID of the watchOS app’s companion iOS app.\n- **WKExtensionDelegateClassName**: The name of your watchOS app’s extension delegate.\n- **WKRunsIndependentlyOfCompanionApp**: A Boolean value indicating whether the user can install and run the watchOS app independently of its iOS companion app.\n- **WKWatchOnly**: A Boolean value indicating whether the app is a watch-only app.\n\n## App experience\n\n- **Creating independent watchOS apps**: Set up a watchOS app that installs and runs without a companion iOS app.\n- **Keeping your watchOS content up to date**: Ensure that your app’s content is relevant and up to date.\n- **Updating watchOS apps with timelines**: Seamlessly schedule updates to your user interface, even while it’s inactive.\n- **Authenticating users on Apple Watch**: Create an account sign-up and sign-in strategy for your app.\n- **Responding to the Action button on Apple Watch Ultra**: Use App Intents to register actions for your app.\n- **Enabling the double-tap gesture on Apple Watch**: Customize your app’s response to the double-tap gesture on Apple Watch.\n\n",
