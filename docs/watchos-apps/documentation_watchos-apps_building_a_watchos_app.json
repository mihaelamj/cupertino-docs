  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nDevelop powerful, personal apps for Apple Watch using SwiftUI, a declarative framework for building user interfaces on all of Apple’s platforms. You can create rich user interfaces by composing simple views — which perform a single, focused task — into larger, more complex layouts. Your app describes the correct layout for its views based on its current state. SwiftUI detects changes to the state and updates the views accordingly.\n\nOn watchOS, SwiftUI gives you considerably more freedom, power, and control than user interfaces laid out and designed in a storyboard. For example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List] has a number of features that aren’t supported by [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceTable], such as the platter style, swipe actions (shown below), and row reordering.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can preview your SwiftUI code in Xcode’s canvas. You can design, build, and test your interfaces without ever running your app.\n\n\n\nSwiftUI also provides watch-specific representations of tab and navigation views, with fully customizable navigation bars and customizable toolbar items for confirmation, cancellation, and destructive actions. You can also use SwiftUI to manage your app’s life cycle. To learn more about SwiftUI, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/tutorials\/SwiftUI].\n\n### Set up the root view\n\nTo manage your app’s life cycle with SwiftUI, create a structure that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/App] protocol in your watchOS app target.\n\nThe [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/attributes] attribute indicates this is the entry point for your app. Each app can have only one entry point.\n\nInside the structure, define the app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/App\/body-swift.property]. The `body` automatically composes a collection of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Scene] instances into a single, compound `Scene`.\n\nNext, add a `Scene` or your app’s root view. For a watchOS app, you typically create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WindowGroup] scene that wraps a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/NavigationView] around your app’s root view. The `NavigationView` provides a navigation stack and title area for your app.\n\nWhen your app launches, it displays the view hierarchy defined by the window group.\n\nYou can also add scenes for notification categories.\n\nWhen the system receives a notification with a matching category, it displays a dynamic view specified by the notification controller. You can create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WKUserNotificationHostingController] subclass for each notification category supported by your app.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchOS-Apps\/documentation\/watchOS-Apps\/customizing-your-long-look-interface].\n\n### Respond to app events in SwiftUI\n\nYour app can respond to many app events directly in SwiftUI.\n\nSwiftUI updates the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/scenePhase] environment value as your app changes state. To update a view based on these changes, you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/onChange(of:perform:)] modifier. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/handling-common-state-transitions].\n\nSwiftUI also provides view modifiers for handling user activity and background tasks:\n\n### Respond to app events using an app delegate\n\nYou need an app delegate to handle the following events:\n\nTo add an app delegate to your app, create a class that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationDelegate] protocol. In this class, implement the methods needed to handle your app’s events. Then use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WKApplicationDelegateAdaptor] property wrapper to declare a variable for your delegate.\n\nWhen your app launches, the system instantiates your delegate class and calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidFinishLaunching()]. Use this method to perform any additional configuration that your delegate requires. After it returns, the system begins calling your delegate methods when the corresponding events occur.",

For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/using-background-tasks].\n\n### Respond to app events using an app delegate\n\nYou need an app delegate to handle the following events:\n\n- Life cycle events, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidFinishLaunching()], that aren’t handled by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/scenePhase] environment variable\n- `userInfo` dictionaries from either handoff or complications\n- Remote Now Playing activity\n- Workout configurations and recovery\n- Extended runtime sessions\n- Registration of remote notifications\n\nTo add an app delegate to your app, create a class that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationDelegate] protocol. In this class, implement the methods needed to handle your app’s events. Then use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WKApplicationDelegateAdaptor] property wrapper to declare a variable for your delegate.\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\nimport WatchKit\n\n@main\nstruct MyProject_Watch_App: App {\n\n    @WKApplicationDelegateAdaptor var appDelegate: MyAppDelegate\n\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            NavigationView {\n                ContentView()\n            }\n        }\n\n        WKNotificationScene(controller: NotificationController.self, category: \"myCategory\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen your app launches, the system instantiates your delegate class and calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidFinishLaunching()].
