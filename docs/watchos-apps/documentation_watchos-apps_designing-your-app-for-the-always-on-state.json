  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe launch of watchOS 6 introduced the Always On state. Supported devices continued to display the time, even when the user isn’t actively interacting with the watch; however, when running an app, the system blurs the app’s user interface and displays the time over it.\n\nIn watchOS 8, Always On expands to include your apps. Apple Watch continues to display your app’s user interface as long as it’s either the frontmost app or running a background session. To preserve battery life, the system updates the user interface at a much lower frequency than when running in the foreground. It also dims the watch.\n\nEven though your app is inactive or running in the background, the system continues to update and monitor many of the user interface elements. For example, when displaying dates and times, using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text\/DateStyle] values like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text\/DateStyle\/relative], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text\/DateStyle\/offset], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text\/DateStyle\/timer], the system automatically updates the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] view while in Always On.\n\nAdditionally, any controls in the user interface remain interactive. Users can tap buttons, toggle switches, or select items from a list. When the user interacts with a control, the system runs the associated action and transitions your app back to the active state.\n\nApps compiled for watchOS 8 and later have Always On enabled by default. You can disable this feature by setting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/WKSupportsAlwaysOnDisplay] key to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] in the WatchKit Extension’s `Info.plist` file. Users can also disable Always On for the entire device or on a per-app basis by choosing Settings > Display & Brightness > Always On.\n\n### Understand frontmost app behavior\n\nBy default, when the user lowers their wrist or stops interacting with their watch, your app transitions to the inactive state. The system continues to display your app’s user interface as long as your app remains the frontmost app (usually two minutes) before transitioning to the background and becoming suspended. If the user dismisses the app (for example, by pressing the Digital Crown or by covering the screen), the app transitions immediately to the background and doesn’t become the frontmost app.\n\nUsers can set the amount of time that apps remain the frontmost app by changing the settings at Settings > General > Wake Screen > Return to Clock. They can also specify a custom time for individual apps from the Wake Screen. In watchOS 8 and later, apps can remain in the frontmost app state for a maximum of 1 hour.\n\nWhen the app is inactive, the user interface doesn’t update by default. However, you can use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineView] to schedule periodic updates. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchOS-Apps\/documentation\/watchOS-Apps\/updating-watchos-apps-with-timelines].\n\n### Update the display during background sessions\n\nApps running a background session, such as a workout session or background audio session, remain onscreen as long as the session is active. Unlike frontmost apps, apps running a background session can continue to update their user interface; however, to save battery life, the system reduces the update frequency.\n\nFor the best user experience when the app transitions to the background, pause any animation and show the final state (or a good static image), and remove any subsecond updates. For example, when the workout app is running in the foreground, the duration shows hundredths of a second, and the BPM row shows an animated heart beat. When it transitions to the background, the app displays a static heart image and the duration only shows time to the nearest second.\n\nFor animation or updates driven by a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineView], check the view’s cadence and update the appearance to match. For more information on timelines, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchOS-Apps\/documentation\/watchOS-Apps\/updating-watchos-apps-with-timelines].\n\nFor other views, monitor the app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/scenePhase] environment variable, and hide or stop subsecond updates when it becomes [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ScenePhase\/inactive] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ScenePhase\/background].\n\n### Hide sensitive information\n\nBecause displayed information may be visible to casual observers, be sure to hide any sensitive data while your app is in Always On. Add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/privacySensitive(_:)] view modifier to blur out specific user interface elements during Always On.\n\nOr access the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/redactionReasons] environment variable.\n\nCheck if this variable contains the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/RedactionReasons\/privacy] value. If it does, eliminate or obscure any sensitive data.\n\nThe resulting user interface displays the private data while the app is running in the foreground.\n\n\n\nBut the interface obscures sensitive data, such as the account number and balance, when the app is in the Always On state.\n\n\n\nTo protect the user’s privacy, always hide any highly sensitive information, such as financial information or health data. For information that may or may not be sensitive, such as incoming messages or appointments, default to showing the information. If the user has any concerns, they can disable Always On on a per-app basis.\n\n### Customize the reduced luminance appearance\n\nTo preserve battery life, the system dims the screen during Always On. The system determines the screen’s overall luminance by comparing the ratio of lit pixels to dark pixels. It then reduces the overall brightness to an appropriate level.\n\nMany system controls also automatically update their appearance during Always On. For example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List] view automatically dims the background for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/CarouselListStyle].\n\nMany apps can use the system’s default Always On appearance. For example, if your view is mostly black and uses system controls, you may not need to change anything. However, you can customize the appearance during Always On to highlight glanceable, important information in your user interface.\n\nFor example, you may consider replacing large blocks of bright content with stroked outlines and dimmed interiors, as shown on the Numerals Duo watch face.\n\n\n\nYou can also dim or remove nonessential information. To customize your interface, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/isLuminanceReduced] environment variable.\n\nYou can then use this value to modify your user interface, as needed.\n\nThe resulting interface displays the title text at full brightness when active.\n\n\n\nThen it dims the title in Always On. Because the ratio of lit to dark pixels is low, the system doesn’t need to make any other changes to the view.\n\n\n\n### Preview both interfaces in Xcode\n\nYou can preview both the regular and Always On interfaces in Xcode. To see the Always On interface, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/isLuminanceReduced] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/redactionReasons] environment variables in the preview.\n\nThe resulting preview shows both the regular and the Always On interfaces.\n\n\n\n### Test Always On in the Simulator\n\nXcode supports Always On in the simulator. Simply click the Toggle Always On button in the status bar to test.\n\n\n\nYou can view any changes to your user interface related to privacy, reduced luminance, or transitioning to an inactive state.",
