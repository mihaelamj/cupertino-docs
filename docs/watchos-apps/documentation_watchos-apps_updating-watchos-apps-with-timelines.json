  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen you schedule periodic updates to your user interface with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineView], updates continue to run even when your app is in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ScenePhase\/background] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ScenePhase\/inactive] state, making this an ideal choice for keeping a watchOS app up-to-date while in the Always On state. Additionally, you can use a `TimelineView` to drive other changes — such as animation — when your app is running in the foreground.\n\n### Set up the timeline\n\nSpecify the part of your user interface that receives periodic updates using a `TimelineView`.\n\nThe `TimelineView` structure takes a schedule that determines when the system makes updates. It also takes a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ViewBuilder] that defines the updatable content. The system then calls the view builder, passing the context for each update.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineView\/Context] instance contains both the time and the current [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineView\/Context\/Cadence-swift.enum] for the updates. When creating the updatable content for the `TimelineView`, use the time from the context, not the current system time. When in Always On, the system may request views up to 5 minutes in the future.\n\nThe cadence also indicates the current maximum rate for updates that the `TimelineView` receives:\n\nThe cadence can change from update to update. Always check the current value and hide information that isn’t relevant. For example, a timer app may show the time remaining in minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a second when it receives updates at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.live` frequency. It can also play animation at that frequency.\n\nWhen the updates drop to the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds` frequency, the app hides the hundredths of seconds and swaps the animation for a static image. The countdown only shows minutes and seconds.\n\nIf the frequency drops to `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.minutes`, the app also hides the seconds and only shows the time remaining to the nearest minute.\n\n### Specify the schedule\n\nWhen you create a `TimelineView`, you must specify the update schedule, which is an instance that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineSchedule] protocol. While you can create your own custom schedules, SwiftUI provides schedules for many common use cases.\n\nThe system attempts to trigger updates based on the schedule, but it can delay or defer an update based on the system’s current state. Additionally, if the schedule is more frequent than the current cadence, the system throttles the updates to the cadence.\n\nCommon schedules include:\n\n### Update during always on\n\nYou can use timeline views to update your watchOS app while it’s in the Always On state; however, you must be able to specify the view’s contents given a `Date` instance for a time in the future. To improve performance, the system may ask for views up to 5 minutes in the future. For example, an egg timer could use a `TimelineView` to display the time remaining during Always On because it can calculate the amount of time remaining given any arbitrary time in the future.\n\nWhen your app is active and in the foreground, the timeline schedule runs in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineScheduleMode\/normal] mode, and your `TimelineView` can receive updates at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.live` cadence. When your app transitions into Always On, the timeline schedule also transitions into the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineScheduleMode\/lowFrequency] mode, the cadence generally drops, and the system may batch-load future updates.\n\nWhile the actual cadence can vary depending on the requested schedule and the current state of the system, apps generally receive an update frequency based on whether they have background runtime or are inactive, frontmost apps.\n\nApps with background runtime receive updates at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds` frequency. This would include apps with an active background session (like workout or background audio apps) or apps executing a background refresh task.\n\nInactive apps receive updates as long as they remain in the frontmost state, generally at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.minutes` frequency. However, if you request a short burst of updates at the `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds` frequency, the system provides that cadence if possible.\n\nFor example, an egg timer could use an `ExplicitTimelineSchedule` to set up per-minute updates for most of the countdown, and switch to per-second updates for the last minute. If conditions permit, the system provides `TimelineView.Context.Cadence.seconds` updates for the last minute.",
