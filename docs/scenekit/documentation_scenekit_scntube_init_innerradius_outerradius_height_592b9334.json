For example, if you create a tube whose outer radius is `5.0`, inner radius is `1.0`, and height is `10.0`, its circular cross section extends from `-5.0` to `5.0` along the x- and z-axes, the y-coordinates of its base and top are `-5.0` and `5.0`, and the hole through its center extends from `-0.5` to `0.5` along the x- and z-axes.",
