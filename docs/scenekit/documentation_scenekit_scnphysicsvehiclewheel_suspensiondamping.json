  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\n*Damping ratio* measures the tendency of the suspension to oscillate after a shock—in other words, for the vehicle to bounce up and down after running over a bump. The default damping ratio of `2.3` causes the wheel to return to its neutral position quickly after a shock. Values lower than `1.0` result in more oscillation.",
