Each wheel object must reference a unique node, which should be a child of the node containing the physics body used for the vehicle’s chassis. Typically, you load a node hierarchy representing the vehicle and all of its wheels from a scene file and then designate which nodes serve as the body and wheels.\n\nFor a behavior to take effect, you must add it to the physics simulation by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsWorld\/addBehavior(_:)] method on your scene’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsWorld] object.",
