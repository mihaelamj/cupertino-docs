With this gradient, the reflections of scene contents closer to the floor are more visible than those of scene contents farther from it. This property marks the distance at which the opacity gradient ends. Scene contents farther away from the floor than this distance do not appear in the reflection.\n\nIf this property’s value is `0.0` (the default), SceneKit does not render the reflection with an opacity falloff—all scene contents are visible in the reflection regardless of their distance from the floor.\n\nYou can animate changes to this property’s value.
