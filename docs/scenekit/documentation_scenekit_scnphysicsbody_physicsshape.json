Typically, you set a body’s physics shape to a bounding box or primitive shape that roughly matches its node’s visible content, but you can use a more detailed shape for more precise collision detection at a cost to performance.\n\nFor details on creating physics shapes, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsShape].",
