The duration of the group action is the longest duration among the collection of actions. If an action in the group has a duration less than the group’s duration, the action completes and then idles until the group completes the remaining actions. This matters most when creating a repeating action that repeats a group.\n\nThis action is reversible; it creates a new group action that contains the reverse of each action specified in the group.",
