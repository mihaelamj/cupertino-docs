Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNSceneSource] class to examine cameras in a scene file without loading its scene graph.\n\nCamera names are saved when you export a scene to a file using its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNScene\/write(to:options:delegate:progressHandler:)] method. These names also appear in the Xcode scene editor.
