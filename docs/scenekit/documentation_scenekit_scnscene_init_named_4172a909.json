Calling this method is equivalent to using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle] class to locate the scene file and passing the resulting URL to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNScene\/init(url:options:)] method, specifying no options and no error handling.\n\nFor more detailed options or to load only part of a file’s scene graph, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNSceneSource] class.\n\nWhen creating a scene using Xcode’s Scene Editor or an external tool, you should copy your scene file into a directory with the .scnassets extension inside your app bundle. You should also place any image files referenced as textures from that scene in an Asset Catalog. Xcode will optimize the scene and texture resources for best performance on each target device, and prepare your texture resources for delivery features such as App Thinning and On-Demand Resources.",
