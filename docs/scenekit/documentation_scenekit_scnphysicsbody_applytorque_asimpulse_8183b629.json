Each component of the torque vector relates to rotation about the corresponding axis in the local coordinate system of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode] object containing the physics body. For example, applying a torque of `{0.0, 0.0, 1.0}` causes a node to spin counterclockwise around the world-space z-axis.\n\nThe `impulse` parameter determines how this method contributes to the physics simulation:\n\n- If you specify [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], SceneKit treats the `direction` parameter as an instantaneous change in angular momentum, measured in newton-meter-seconds.\n- If you specify [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], SceneKit treats the `direction` parameter as a torque, measured in newton-meters. At the end of each simulation step (by default, a step occurs once for each frame in the rendering loop), SceneKit sums all forces and torques applied to the physics body during that step and accelerates the body according to the net effect of those forces and torques. Use this option when you want to simulate gradual acceleration by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsBody\/applyTorque(_:asImpulse:)] on each simulation step.\n\n\n\nAs with all physical quantities in SceneKit, you need not use realistic force and torque measurements in your app—the effects of the physics simulation depend on the relative differences between forces, not on their absolute values. You may use whatever values produce the behavior or gameplay you’re looking for as long as you use them consistently.\n\n## Applying Forces, Impulses, and Torques\n\n- **applyForce(_:asImpulse:)**: Applies a force or impulse to the body at its center of mass.\n- **applyForce(_:at:asImpulse:)**: Applies a force or impulse to the body at a specific point.\n- **clearAllForces()**: Cancels all continuous forces and torques acting on the physics body during the current simulation step.\n\n",
