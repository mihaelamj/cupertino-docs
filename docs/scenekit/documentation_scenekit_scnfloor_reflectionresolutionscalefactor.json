  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nSceneKit creates a reflection effect by rendering the scene twice. First, it renders the scene into an offscreen buffer, using a point of view whose position is the reflection of the camera’s position. Next, it renders the scene from the camera’s point of view, using the offscreen buffer as a texture map for the floor’s surface. Rendering the scene twice incurs a performance cost. Reducing the resolution of the offscreen buffer reduces this cost but causes the reflected image to appear blurry.\n\nThe default scale factor is `1.0` in macOS and `0.5` in iOS.",

Animatable.\n- **reflectionFalloffEnd**: The distance from the floor at which scene contents are no longer reflected. Animatable.\n- **reflectionFalloffStart**: The distance from the floor at which scene contents are reflected at full intensity. Animatable.\n- **reflectionCategoryBitMask**: A mask that defines which categories of other objects show reflections on the floor.\n\n",
