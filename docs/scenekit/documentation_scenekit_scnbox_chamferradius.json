Setting a corner radius of less than zero creates an empty geometry.\n\nThe maximum corner radius is half the box’s smallest dimension. For example, if a box’s width and length are both `5.0` and its height is `10.0`, its maximum corner radius is `2.5`. With these dimensions, the box’s four rounded vertical edges join to form a cylinder and its vertical faces disappear. Increasing the corner radius beyond the maximum has no visible effect.\n\nYou can animate changes to this property’s value.
