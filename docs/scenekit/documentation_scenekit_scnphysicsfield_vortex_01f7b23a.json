(The field’s axis is a line that is parallel to its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/direction] vector and that passes through its center. For details, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/offset] property.) For example, when a vortex field’s area of effect contains many objects, the resulting scene resembles a tornado: The objects simultaneously revolve around and fly away from the field’s center.\n\nBy default, a vortex circulates counterclockwise relative to its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/direction] vector. To make it circulate clockwise, set the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property to a negative value.\n\nThe default [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/falloffExponent] value for a vortex field is `0.0`, indicating that the field’s effect is constant throughout its area of effect.",
