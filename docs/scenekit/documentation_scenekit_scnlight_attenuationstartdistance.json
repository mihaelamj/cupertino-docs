At distances less than the start distance, the light’s illumination is at full intensity. At distances greater than the end distance, the light provides no illumination. At distances in between the start and end distance, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNLight\/attenuationFalloffExponent] property defines the transition from full illumination to no illumination.\n\nThe default value is `0.0`, specifying no attenuation (the light’s intensity is the same at all distances).\n\nYou can animate changes to this property’s value.
