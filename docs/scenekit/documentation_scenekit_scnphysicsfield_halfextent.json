  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nTo define a field’s area of effect, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode\/position] property of the node that contains the field and the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/halfExtent] property. The center of the area of effect is the node’s position. The half-extent, a position vector in the local coordinate space of the node containing the field, marks one corner of a box, and the negative of the half-extent vector marks the opposite corner of the box. For example, if a node’s position is the vector `{2.0, 2.0, 2.0}` and it contains a physics field whose half-extent is the vector `{0.5, 0.5, 0.5}`, the field’s area of effect is the box extending from `1.5` to `2.5` along each axis of the scene’s coordinate system.\n\nBy default, a field’s area of effect is the interior of this box shape. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/usesEllipsoidalExtent] property to instead make the area of effect an ellipsoid bounded by this box. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/scope] property to choose whether the area of effect is the interior or exterior of the box (or ellipsoid).\n\nThe default half-extent is the vector `{INFINITY, INFINITY, INFINITY}`, specifying that the field affects bodies located anywhere in the scene.",
