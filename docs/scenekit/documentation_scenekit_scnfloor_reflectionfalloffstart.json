With this gradient, the reflections of scene contents closer to the floor are more visible than those of scene contents farther from it. This property marks the distance at which the opacity gradient begins. Scene contents closer to the floor than this distance appear in the reflection with full intensity.\n\nThe default value of this property is `0.0`, indicating that the falloff gradient begins immediately.\n\nYou can animate changes to this property’s value.

With this gradient, the reflections of scene contents closer to the floor are more visible than those of scene contents farther from it. This property marks the distance at which the opacity gradient begins. Scene contents closer to the floor than this distance appear in the reflection with full intensity.\n\nThe default value of this property is `0.0`, indicating that the falloff gradient begins immediately.\n\nYou can animate changes to this property’s value. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/animating-scenekit-content].\n\n## Adding Reflections to a Floor\n\n- **reflectivity**: The intensity of the scene’s reflection on the floor. Animatable.\n- **reflectionFalloffEnd**: The distance from the floor at which scene contents are no longer reflected. Animatable.\n- **reflectionResolutionScaleFactor**: The resolution scale factor of the offscreen buffer that SceneKit uses to render reflections.\n- **reflectionCategoryBitMask**: A mask that defines which categories of other objects show reflections on the floor.\n\n",
