  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA physics field object. To use the field in a scene, attach it to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode\/physicsField] property of an [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode] object.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this field type to make objects behave differently from one another when they enter a region, or to make an object’s behavior different from its mass-based behavior. An electric field behaves according to the first part of the Lorentz force equation modeling real-world electromagnetic forces—the field applies a force whose magnitude is proportional to electric charge and distance.\n\nBy default, physics bodies and particle systems have no electric charge, so they are unaffected by electric and magnetic fields. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsBody\/charge] property of a physics body or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNParticleSystem\/particleCharge] property of a particle system to add charge-based behavior.\n\nWhen the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] value is positive (the default), it attracts bodies whose charge is negative and repels bodies whose charge is positive. To reverse this behavior, set the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property to a negative value.\n\nThe default [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/falloffExponent] value for an electric field is `2.0`, indicating that the field’s effect diminishes with the square of its distance from its center.",
