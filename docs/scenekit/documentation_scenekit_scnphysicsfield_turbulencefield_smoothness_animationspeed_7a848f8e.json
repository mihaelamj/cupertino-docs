Unlike a noise field, a turbulence field applies a force whose magnitude is proportional to the speed of each affected object. For example, an object passing through a noise field shakes as it travels through the field, but an object passing through a turbulence field shakes more violently the faster it travels. The field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property scales the magnitude of the turbulence effect.\n\nThe default [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/falloffExponent] value for a turbulence field is `0.0`, indicating that the field’s effect is constant throughout its area of effect.",
