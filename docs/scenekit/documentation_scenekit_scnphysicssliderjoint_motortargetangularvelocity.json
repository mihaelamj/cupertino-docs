Changing this value causes the joint to act as a rotary motor, continuously applying a torque (specified by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsSliderJoint\/motorMaximumTorque] property) until its connected bodies are rotating around the joint at the new angular velocity.",
