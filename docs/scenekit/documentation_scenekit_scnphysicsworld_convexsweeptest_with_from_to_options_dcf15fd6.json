This shape must enclose a convex volume. For details on creating shapes that satisfy this requirement, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsShape].\n- **from**: A transform matrix representing the initial position and orientation of the shape.\n- **to**: A transform matrix representing the final position and orientation of the shape.\n- **options**: A dictionary of options affecting the test, or `nil` to use default options. For applicable keys and the possible values, see `Physics Test Options Keys`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsContact] objects describing any contacts that would occur when moving the physics shape through the physics world.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when it’s important to plan for (or avoid) collisions ahead of the physics simulation.
