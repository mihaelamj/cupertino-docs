(For details on each type of field, see the methods listed in Creating Physics Fields.) Changing the direction changes the effects of these field types.\n\nThe default direction is the vector `{0, -1, 0}`. With this direction, for example, linear gravity fields whose strength is positive cause objects to fall in the “down” direction of scene space.",
