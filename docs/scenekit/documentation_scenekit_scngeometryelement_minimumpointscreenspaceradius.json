  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nSome visual effects call for rendering a geometry as a collection of individual points—that is, a point cloud, not a solid surface or wireframe mesh. When you use this option, SceneKit can render each point as a small 2D surface that always faces the camera. By applying a texture or custom shader to that surface, you can efficiently render many small objects at once.\n\nTo render a geometry element as a point cloud, you must set three properties: [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNGeometryElement\/pointSize], [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNGeometryElement\/minimumPointScreenSpaceRadius], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNGeometryElement\/maximumPointScreenSpaceRadius]. Use [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNGeometryElement\/pointSize] to determine how large each point appears in world space, so that points farther away appear as smaller 2D surfaces. Use the minimum and maximum radius properties to ensure that the on-screen rendering of each point fits within a certain range of pixel sizes.\n\nFor example, to render a point cloud where each point is always one pixel wide (like a field of stars), set both the minimum and maximum sizes to one pixel. To render a group of objects whose screen sizes vary with perspective (like a set of images representing planets), set the minimum size to one pixel and the maximum size to a much larger value.",
