  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nAmbient occlusion is an effect that improves material shading by calculating the amounts of ambient light that reach various parts of a surface, creating shadows on parts of a geometry where incoming light is obscured by other parts of the geometry. (You can provide pre-rendered ambient occlusion effects for a material using its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterial\/ambientOcclusion] property.) *Screen-space ambient occlusion* (SSAO) provides a real-time approximation of this effect for the entire scene viewed through the camera.\n\nSSAO shadowing includes a blur effect to realistically soften differences in shadow between adjacent pixels, which depends on both the smoothness of scene geometry and this factor. Larger blur factors create a softer, more spread-out blur; smaller factors create coarser shadowing effects.",
