The field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property measures this acceleration in meters per second per second.\n\nBy default, a linear gravity field accelerates objects in along its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/direction] vector. To make it accelerate objects in the opposite direction, set the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property to a negative value.\n\nThe default [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/falloffExponent] value for a linear gravity field is `0.0`, indicating that the field’s effect is constant throughout its area of effect.",
