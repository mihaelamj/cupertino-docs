  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nPhysics fields apply forces to other physics bodies in a specified area around their node. For example, a SCNPhysicsDragField field slows all physics bodies that pass through its area. For a full list of field types and their effects, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField].\n\nA node can contain both a physics body that defines collision behavior and a physics field that defines forces in its area. For example, two nodes containing physics bodies and radial gravity fields will be attracted to one another, but will bounce off each other when they collide.",
