The field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property measures this acceleration in meters per second per second.\n\nBy default, a radial gravity field attracts objects toward its center. To make it repel objects instead, set the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property to a negative value.\n\nThe default [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/falloffExponent] value for a radial gravity field is `2.0`, indicating that the field’s effect diminishes with the square of distance from its center.",
