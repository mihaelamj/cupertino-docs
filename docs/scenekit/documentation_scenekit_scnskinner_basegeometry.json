The new model must be compatible with the skinner’s animation skeleton (that is, it must have the same number of vertices).\n\nBecause multiple skinner objects can reference the same geometry, you can use the geometry with several nodes in your scene, each with a different skinner object to pose the model in different ways.\n\n## Working with a Skinned Geometry\n\n- **baseGeometryBindTransform**: The coordinate transformation for the skinner’s geometry in its default state.\n\n",
