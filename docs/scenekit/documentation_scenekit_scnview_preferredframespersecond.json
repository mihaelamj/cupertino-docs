The actual frame rate is usually a factor of the maximum refresh rate of the screen to provide a consistent frame rate. For example, if the maximum refresh rate of the screen is `60` frames per second, that is also the highest frame rate the view sets as the actual frame rate. However, if you ask for a lower frame rate, SceneKit might choose `30`, `20`, `15` or some other factor to be the actual frame rate. For this reason, you want to choose a frame rate that your app can consistently maintain.\n\nThe default value is `60` frames per second.",
