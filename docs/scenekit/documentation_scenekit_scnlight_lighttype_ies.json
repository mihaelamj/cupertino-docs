The position of the containing node determines the location of the light source, and the orientation of the node determines the relative directions specified by the photometric profile. Spotlight angle attributes do not apply to photometric lights.\n\nFor more information about photometric lights, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNLight\/iesProfileURL] property.",
