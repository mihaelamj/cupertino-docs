  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nYou can use an *emissive map* texture to simulate parts of a surface that glow with their own light. SceneKit does not treat the material as a light source—rather, the emission property determines colors for a material independent of lighting. (To create an object that appears to glow, you may wish to combine a geometry with an emissive map and additional [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNLight] objects added to the scene.)\n\nBy default, the emissive property’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterialProperty\/contents] object is a black color, causing the property to have no visible effect. Setting the emissive property’s contents to any solid color adds a uniform color to the material independent of lighting. To create a selective glow effect, set the property’s contents to an image or other texture-mapped content whose glowing areas use bright colors and whose other areas use darker colors. In the darker-color portions of the emissive map (and portions with reduced opacity), the other visual properties of the material contribute to its appearance under scene lighting.\n\nThe figure below shows a material (with a texture for its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterial\/diffuse] property) before and after providing an emissive map image.\n\n",
