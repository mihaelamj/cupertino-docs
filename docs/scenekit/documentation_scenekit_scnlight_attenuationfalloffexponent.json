At distances in between the start and end distance, the light’s intensity transitions from full to no illumination according to the value of this property.\n\nA value of `0.0` specifies no attenuation—the light’s intensity is the same at all distances. A value of `1.0` specifies a linear transition, and a value of `2.0` (the default) specifies a quadratic transition curve. Higher values have little visible effect.\n\nYou can animate changes to this property’s value. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/animating-scenekit-content].",
