  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA physics field object. To use the field in a scene, attach it to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode\/physicsField] property of an [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode] object.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this field type to make objects behave differently from one another when they enter a region, or to make an object’s behavior different from its mass based behavior. A magnetic field behaves according to the second part of the Lorentz force equation modeling real-world electromagnetic forces—the field applies a force determined by the cross product of an object’s velocity vector and the magnetic field vector at the object’s location, with magnitude proportional to the object’s electric charge.\n\nBy default, physics bodies and particle systems have no electric charge, so they are unaffected by electric and magnetic fields. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsBody\/charge] property of a physics body or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNParticleSystem\/particleCharge] property of a particle system to add charge-based behavior.\n\nWhen the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] value is positive (the default), the magnetic field vectors circulate counterclockwise relative to the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/direction] vector. (That is, the magnetic field models a real-world magnetic field created by current in a wire oriented in the field’s direction.) To make field vectors circulate clockwise, set the field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property to a negative value.\n\nThe default [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/falloffExponent] value for a magnetic field is `2.0`, indicating that the field’s effect diminishes with the square of distance from its center.",
