Use this option to simulate instantaneous effects such as launching a projectile.\n- If you specify [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], SceneKit treats the `direction` parameter as a force, measured in newtons. At the end of each simulation step (by default, a step occurs once for each frame in the rendering loop), SceneKit sums all forces applied to the physics body during that step and accelerates the body according to the net effect of those forces. Use this option when you want to simulate continuous forces on the body by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsBody\/applyForce(_:asImpulse:)] on each simulation step.\n\n\n\nAs with all physical quantities in SceneKit, you need not use realistic force measurements in your app—the effects of the physics simulation depend on the relative differences between forces, not on their absolute values. You may use whatever values produce the behavior or gameplay you’re looking for as long as you use them consistently.\n\n## Applying Forces, Impulses, and Torques\n\n- **applyForce(_:at:asImpulse:)**: Applies a force or impulse to the body at a specific point.\n- **applyTorque(_:asImpulse:)**: Applies a net torque or a change in angular momentum to the body.\n- **clearAllForces()**: Cancels all continuous forces and torques acting on the physics body during the current simulation step.\n\n",
