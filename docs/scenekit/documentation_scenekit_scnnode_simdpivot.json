Animatable.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nvar simdPivot: simd_float4x4 { get set }\n```\n\n## Discussion\n\nA node’s pivot is the transform between its coordinate space and that used by its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode\/simdPosition], [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode\/simdRotation], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode\/simdScale] properties. The default pivot is the identity matrix, specifying that the node’s position locates the origin of its coordinate system, its rotation is about an axis through its center, and its scale is also relative to that center point.\n\nChanging the pivot transform alters these behaviors in many useful ways. You can:\n\n- Offset the node’s contents relative to its position. For example, by setting the pivot to a translation transform you can position a node containing a sphere geometry relative to where the sphere would rest on a floor instead of relative to its center.\n- Move the node’s axis of rotation. For example, with a translation transform you can cause a node to revolve around a faraway point instead of rotating around its center, and with a rotation transform you can tilt the axis of rotation.\n- Adjust the center point and direction for scaling the node. For example, with a translation transform you can cause a node to grow or shrink relative to a corner instead of to its center.\n\nYou can animate changes to this property’s value. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/animating-scenekit-content].\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **pivot**: The pivot point for the node’s position, rotation, and scale.
