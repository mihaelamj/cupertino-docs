For example, consider a node containing a spotlight, constrained by an [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNLookAtConstraint] object to point toward another node containing a moving game character. If the constraint’s influence factor is `1.0`, SceneKit adjusts the spotlight node to point directly at the game character each time it renders a frame. If you reduce the influence factor to `0.5`, each time SceneKit renders a frame it moves the spotlight halfway from its current orientation to the target orientation. As a result, the spotlight continues to follow the moving character, but with a slight lag.\n\nThe default influence factor is `1.0`, specifying that SceneKit apply the full effect of the constraint every frame. An influence factor of `0.0` means the constraint has no effect.\n\nThis property has no effect on [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNTransformConstraint] objects.",
