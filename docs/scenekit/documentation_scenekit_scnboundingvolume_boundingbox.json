  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nScene Kit defines a bounding box in the local coordinate space using two points identifying its corners, which implicitly determine six axis-aligned planes marking its limits. For example, if a geometry’s bounding box has the minimum corner `{-1, 0, 2}` and the maximum corner `{3, 4, 5}`, all points in the geometry’s vertex data have an x-coordinate value between `-1.0` and `3.0`, inclusive.\n\nThe coordinates provided when reading this property are valid only if the object has a volume to be measured. For a geometry containing no vertex data or a node containing no geometry, the values `min` and `max` are both zero.\n\nBy default, Scene Kit automatically computes the bounding volumes of nodes and geometries and uses this information to assist in rendering. Setting a new value for this property overrides the default bounding box.",
