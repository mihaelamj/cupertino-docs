For example, the geometry loaded from a scene file for a game character may have associated animations for player actions such as walking and jumping. When the player lands from a jump, you remove the jump animation so the character continues walking. If you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNAnimatable\/removeAnimation(forKey:)] method to remove the jump animation, SceneKit abruptly switches from the current frame of the jump animation to the current frame of the walk animation. If you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNAnimatable\/removeAnimation(forKey:fadeOutDuration:)] method instead, SceneKit plays both animations at once during that duration and interpolates vertex positions from one animation to the other, creating a smooth transition.",
