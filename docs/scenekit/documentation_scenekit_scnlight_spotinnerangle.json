Additionally, the illuminated area can smoothly transition from full illumination to no illumination. This property determines the width of the fully illuminated area.\n\nThe default value is `0.0`, specifying that only the center of the area illuminated by the spotlight is lit at full intensity.\n\nYou can animate changes to this property’s value.
