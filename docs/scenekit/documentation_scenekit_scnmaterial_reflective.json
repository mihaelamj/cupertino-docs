SceneKit does not render real-time reflections of the objects in a scene, but it can use an *environment map* texture to simulate reflection of a static or animated image. When rendering each pixel on the surface, SceneKit traces the light from that point to a pixel in the environment map as if the surface was reflecting that image.\n\nBy default, the reflective property’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterialProperty\/contents] object is a white color, causing the property to have no visible effect. Setting the reflective property’s contents to any solid color adds uniform shading to the material. To create a reflective effect, set the property’s contents to an image or other texture-mapped content.\n\nTo produce a mirror-finish effect using an environment map, the texture image should take one of two forms:\n\n- A sphere map, a square image whose content depicts an environment as reflected by a mirrored sphere.\n- A cube map, an array of six square images which together form an imaginary cube enclosing the scene, whose inner surfaces are reflected by the material. You create a cube map by setting the reflective property’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterialProperty\/contents] object to an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSArray] instance containing six images, each corresponding to a direction in the scene’s world coordinate space in the following order: +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z (or Right, Left, Top, Bottom, Near, Far).\n\nThe figure below shows a material (with a texture for its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterial\/normal] property) before and after providing a cube map for the reflective property.\n\n\n\nThis material property does not apply to physically-based materials (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterial\/LightingModel-swift.struct\/physicallyBased]). Instead, such materials reflect environment-based lighting (see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNScene] [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNScene\/lightingEnvironment] property) based on their [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterial\/metalness] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterial\/roughness] properties.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **normal**: An object that defines the nominal orientation of the surface at each point for use in lighting.\n- **emission**: An object that defines the color emitted by each point on a surface.\n\n## Visual Properties for Basic Shading\n\n- **diffuse**: An object that manages the material’s diffuse response to lighting.\n- **ambient**: An object that manages the material’s response to ambient lighting.\n- **specular**: An object that manages the material’s specular response to lighting.\n- **multiply**: An object that provides color values that are multiplied with pixels in a material after all other shading is complete.\n- **transparent**: An object that determines the opacity of each point in a material.\n- **shininess**: The sharpness of specular highlights.
