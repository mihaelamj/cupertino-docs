  "overview" : "## Overview\n\n\n\nYou control these transitions by associating an [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMorpher] object with a node using its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode\/morpher] property. The morpher maintains an array of target geometries and a set of weights associated with each. When all weights are zero, the surface takes the form of the base geometry (from the node’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNNode\/geometry] property). When you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMorpher\/setWeight(_:forTargetAt:)] method to increase a weight to `1.0`, the surface takes the form of the geometry at the corresponding index in the morpher’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMorpher\/targets] array. If you use a variety of weight values for several targets, the surface takes a form that proportionally interpolates between the target geometries.\n\nYou can also animate weights implicitly or explicitly using keypath animations. For example, the following code creates a morph animation that transitions one target weight back and forth repeatedly:\n\nA morpher and its target geometries may be loaded from a scene file or created programmatically. The base geometry and all target geometries must be topologically identical—that is, they must contain the same number and structural arrangement of vertices.",
