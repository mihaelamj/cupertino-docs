(You can provide pre-rendered ambient occlusion effects for a material using its [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNMaterial\/ambientOcclusion] property.) *Screen-space ambient occlusion* (SSAO) provides a real-time approximation of this effect for the entire scene viewed through the camera.\n\nThis [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNCamera\/screenSpaceAmbientOcclusionDepthThreshold] property controls the effect of relative distance from the camera on SSAO effects. Higher values create more shadowing effects between foreground and background elements of the scene, but this can result in unrealistic dark halos around foreground elements that are far from the background. Lower values avoid dark halo effects, but create less visual separation between scene elements at different distances from the camera. The default value is 0.2 units.",
