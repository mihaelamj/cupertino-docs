(That is, the field behaves according to Hooke’s Law of real-world spring forces.) An object placed at the center of the field and moved away will oscillate around the center, with a period of oscillation that is proportional to the object’s mass. The field’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/strength] property scales the magnitude of the spring effect—a larger strength simulates a stiffer spring.\n\nThe default [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField\/falloffExponent] value for a spring field is `1.0`, indicating that the field’s effect diminishes linearly with distance from its center.",
