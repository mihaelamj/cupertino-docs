For more sophisticated gravity effects, including limited areas of effect and strength proportional to distance, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.scenekit\/documentation\/SceneKit\/SCNPhysicsField] class. When using fields, you may want to set this property to the zero vector so that fields provide all gravity effects in the physics world.",
