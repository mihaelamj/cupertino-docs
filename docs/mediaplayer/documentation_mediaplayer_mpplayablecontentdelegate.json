Due to buffering and network conditions, it may take several seconds for audio to begin playing after a user selects it. The user’s selection remains highlighted, and the system displays a spinning activity indicator until your app informs the system that the audio is ready to play.\n- Start playback as soon as possible. Playback should begin as soon as audio has sufficiently loaded, even if descriptive information is still loading. Continue loading descriptive information in the background and show it once available.\n- Avoid beginning playback automatically. Unless your app’s purpose is to play a single source of audio, it shouldn’t begin playback until the user initiates it.\n\n## Playing a specific media item\n\n- **playableContentManager(_:initiatePlaybackOfContentItemAt:completionHandler:)**: Asks the delegate to begin playback of the specified content item.\n\n## Suggesting content for playback\n\n- **playableContentManager(_:initializePlaybackQueueWithContentItems:completionHandler:)**: Asks the delegate to prepare suggested content for playback.\n- **playableContentManager(_:initializePlaybackQueueWithCompletionHandler:)**: Asks the delegate to prepare suggested content for playback.\n\n## Responding to context changes\n\n- **playableContentManager(_:didUpdate:)**: Notifies the delegate that the playable content manager’s context information has changed.\n\n## Responding to playback events\n\n- **delegate**: A delegate that lets the media player manage the app’s playback queue.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObjectProtocol\n\n",
