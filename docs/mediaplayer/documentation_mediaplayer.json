You can then play that content directly or ask the system Music app to play it. For example, a game might give users the option to play their own music while completing a particular game level.\n\n\n\nTo play content from the user’s library using the Media Player framework, use one of the built-in [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMusicPlayerController] objects:\n\n- An *application player* plays music locally within your app. Use this player when you want greater control over the audio you play for the user. This player doesn’t change the state of the built-in Music app.\n- The *system player* employs the Music app to play audio on your behalf. Use this player when you want audio to continue playing even when the user switches away from your app.\n\nUse media queries to retrieve the items you want to play and to populate the queue for the media player you select. After a user gives your app permission to access their Apple Music account, it can add songs, create playlists, and play songs from Apple Music. If your app detects that the user isn’t an Apple Music subscriber, it can offer a trial.\n\nYou can’t play video media items directly using the Media Player framework. To play videos containing [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMediaItem] objects, use an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayer] object from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation]. The system player also provides a way to play video items using the system apps.\n\n\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **NSAppleMusicUsageDescription**: A message that tells people why the app is requesting
