  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe Media Player framework defines a standard set of remote command objects for handling media-related events. When an accessory or iOS user interface generates a remote control event, the system notifies the corresponding command object on the shared [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPRemoteCommandCenter] instance. That command object executes any attached handlers.\n\nTo respond to a particular event, register a handler with the appropriate [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPRemoteCommand] object.\n\nListing 1. Registering a remote control event handler\n\nIf you explicitly don’t want to enable a given command, fetch the command object and set its enabled property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false]. Disabling a remote command lets the system know that it shouldn’t display any related UI for that command when your app is the Now Playing app.\n\nThe framework defines many subclasses to handle specific kinds of commands. Sometimes, these subclasses let you specify other information related to the command. For example, feedback commands let you specify a localized string that describes the meaning of the feedback. When supporting a particular command, be sure to look up the specific class used to handle those events.",
