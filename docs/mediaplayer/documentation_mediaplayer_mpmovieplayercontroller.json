  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nPlayback occurs in a view owned by the movie player and takes place either fullscreen or inline. You can incorporate a movie player’s view into a view hierarchy owned by your app, or use an MPMoviePlayerViewController object to manage the presentation for you.\n\nMovie players support wireless movie playback to AirPlay-enabled hardware such as Apple TV. AirPlay playback is enabled by default. To disable AirPlay in your app, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerController\/allowsAirPlay] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false]. In iOS 8.0 and later, users access AirPlay compatible hardware through the Control Panel; no AirPlay control is displayed by the movie player.\n\nWhen you add a movie player’s view to your app’s view hierarchy, be sure to size the frame correctly, as shown here:\n\nConsider a movie player view to be an opaque structure. You can add your own custom subviews to layer content on top of the movie but you must never modify any of its existing subviews.\n\nIn addition to layering content on top of a movie, you can provide custom background content by adding subviews to the view in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerController\/backgroundView] property. Custom subviews are supported in both inline and fullscreen playback modes but you must adjust the positions of your views when entering or exiting fullscreen mode. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerWillEnterFullscreenNotification] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerWillExitFullscreenNotification] notifications to detect changes to and from fullscreen mode.\n\nThis class supports programmatic control of movie playback, and user-based control via buttons supplied by the movie player. You can control most aspects of playback programmatically using the methods and properties of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMediaPlayback] protocol, to which this class conforms. The methods and properties of that protocol let you start and stop playback, seek forward and backward through the movie’s content, and even change the playback rate. In addition, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerController\/controlStyle] property of this class lets you display a set of standard system controls that allow the user to manipulate playback. You can also set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerController\/shouldAutoplay] property for network-based content to start automatically.\n\nYou typically specify the movie you want to play when you create a new `MPMoviePlayerController` object. However, you can also change the currently playing movie by changing the value in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerController\/contentURL] property. Changing this property lets you reuse the same movie player controller object in multiple places. For performance reasons you may want to play movies as local files. Do this by first downloading them to a local directory.\n\nTo facilitate the creation of video bookmarks or chapter links for a long movie, the `MPMoviePlayerController` class defines methods for generating thumbnail images at specific times within a movie. You can request a single thumbnail image using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerController\/thumbnailImage(atTime:timeOption:)] method or request multiple thumbnail images using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mediaplayer\/documentation\/MediaPlayer\/MPMoviePlayerController\/requestThumbnailImages(atTimes:timeOption:)] method.\n\nTo play a network stream whose URL requires access credentials, first create an appropriate [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLCredential] object. Do this by calling, for example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLCredential\/init(user:password:persistence:)] method, as shown here:\n\nIn addition, create an appropriate [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLProtectionSpace] object, as shown here. Make appropriate modifications for the realm you are accessing:\n\nAdd the URL credential and the protection space to the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/DevPedia-CocoaCore\/Singleton.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008195-CH49] [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLCredentialStorage] object. Do this by calling, for example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLCredentialStorage\/set(_:for:)] method, as shown here:\n\nWith the credential and protection space information in place, you can then play the protected stream.\n\n### Movie player notifications\n\nA movie player generates notifications to keep your app informed about the state of movie playback. In addition to being notified when playback finishes, your app can be notified in the following situations:\n\nFor more information, see the Notifications section in this document.",
