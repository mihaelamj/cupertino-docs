  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis sample code project shows you how to use your camera app with a DockKit accessory to frame and track subjects in real time. It demonstrates how DockKit system tracking works for your camera app, and how you can override system tracking to frame and track specific subjects using custom machine learning signals. It also shows you how to integrate physical buttons on your DockKit device with camera controls.\n\nThe sample uses SwiftUI and the features of Swift concurrency to build a responsive camera app with DockKit control. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/avcam-building-a-camera-app] for more details about the camera implementation design. This sample code project uses the sample app from that project as a starting point to write a basic camera app.  The following diagram depicts the app’s design:\n\n\n\nThe sample app defines two key services:\n\n### Configure the sample code project\n\nBecause Simulator doesn’t have access to device cameras and can’t connect to a DockKit device, it isn’t suitable for running the sample app. To run the app, you need an iPhone with iOS 18 or later.\n\n### Write a basic camera app to take photos\n\nSee [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/avcam-building-a-camera-app] to learn how to write a basic camera app to capture videos using an iPhone’s front and rear cameras.\n\n### Configure the DockKit accessory manager\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureSession] is a singleton class that provides connection and disconnection notifications with a DockKit accessory by subscribing to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessoryManager\/accessoryStateChanges] API.\n\nThe dock control service subscribes to `accessoryStateChanges` in its `setUp(features: DockAccessoryFeatures)` method.\n\nWhen an accessory connects, DockKit sets it up to use system tracking, and to listen to accessory events and battery states in `setupAccessorySubscriptions(for accesory: DockAccessory)`.\n\n### Change the tracking mode\n\nThe app provides a tracking mode menu to switch between system tracking, custom tracking, and manual tracking. The default is system tracking, which the app sets by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessoryManager\/setSystemTrackingEnabled(_:)] to `true`.\n\nThe app provides various menus and options to configure the selected subjects, selected frame, region to track, and more. All menus and buttons primarily live in the main DockKit menu.\n\n### Tap to track the subject\n\nThe app provides a tap-to-track toggle to enable or disable selecting a specific subject to track by tapping the camera view. When the tap-to-track toggle is enabled, the `selectSubject(at point: CGPoint?)` method allows people to select tapped subjects.\n\n### Set the region of interest\n\nThe app provides a region-of-interest toggle to enable or disable setting a region of interest to frame the selected subjects by holding and dragging the camera view. When toggling the region of interest, the `setRegionOfInterest(to region: CGRect)` method allows setting a region [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGRect] in the camera view. The dock accessory keeps the subjects framed in the selected region.\n\n### Set the framing mode\n\nThe app provides a framing mode menu to select a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/FramingMode-swift.enum].\n\nThe app uses the helper function `dockKitFramingMode(from: framing)` to map a local `FramingMode` enumeration to `DockAccessory.FramingMode`.\n\n### Implement manual control using actuator velocities\n\nWhen someone sets the `TrackingMode` to `TrackingMode.manual`, the app provides chevrons to move `DockAccessory` up, left, right, and down by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/setAngularVelocity(_:)] API.\n\n### Run the default animations\n\nThe app provides buttons to run the four default animations that `DockAccessory` provides. Before running the animation, the app disables system tracking. When the animation is complete, the app restores system tracking to its prior value.\n\nThe app uses the helper function `dockKitAnimation(from animation: Animation)` to map a local animation enumeration to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/Animation].\n\nThe DockKit menu provides toggles to subscribe to various states, like battery and tracking, and displays them in the app’s UI.\n\n### Implement the battery state\n\nThe dock control service subscribes to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/batteryStates-swift.property] to acquire the current battery state of the accessory. The current battery state includes the battery level, charging indicator, and so forth.\n\n### Implement the tracking states\n\nThe dock control service subscribes to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/TrackingStates-swift.struct] to get a list of tracked subjects with attributes like saliency and speaking confidence. The dock control service delegates the handling of the conversion from a normalized subject rectangle to camera view space coordinates to the `CameraModel`, which uses the capture service for the operation. The app uses these states, along with the transformed subject rectangle, to show an overlay on the faces of the subjects.\n\n### Implement camera control using accessory events\n\nThe dock control service subscribes to an `async` stream of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/AccessoryEvents-swift.struct]. A physical input on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory] triggers an accessory event. When the app receives an accessory event, it delegates handling of the event to the `CameraModel`, which uses the capture service to perform camera operations.\n\n`CameraModel` implements the sample’s `CameraCaptureDelegate` protocol and provides the helper methods to control the camera.\n\n### Implement the camera zoom\n\nThe capture service implements the `updateMagnification(for zoomType: CameraZoomType, by scale: Double = 0.2)` method in response to a zoom event from the accessory.\n\n### Implement the camera shutter\n\nThe capture service implements the `startRecording()` method in response to a start-capture shutter event, and a `stopRecording()` method in response to a stop-capture shutter event.\n\n### Implement the camera flip\n\nThe capture service implements the `selectNextVideoDevice()` method in reponse to the camera flip event.",

See [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/avcam-building-a-camera-app] for more details about the camera implementation design. This sample code project uses the sample app from that project as a starting point to write a basic camera app.  The following diagram depicts the app’s design:\n\n\n\nThe sample app defines two key services:\n\n- `CaptureService` is an actor that manages the interactions with the AVFoundation capture APIs. This object configures the capture pipeline and manages its life cycle, and it defines an asynchronous interface to capture videos. It also delegates handling of those operatons to the app’s `MovieCapture` object.\n- `DockControlService` is an actor that manages interactions with a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory] using DockKit APIs. This object listens to `DockAccessory` connection\/disconnection events, manages subscriptions to the connected `DockAccessory`, and controls its movements using an asynchronous interface. It also delegates camera control in response to `DockAccessory` events to the `CameraModel` object.\n\n\n\n### Configure the sample code project\n\nBecause Simulator doesn’t have access to device cameras and can’t connect to a DockKit device, it isn’t suitable for running the sample app. To run the app, you need an iPhone with iOS 18 or later.\n\n### Write a basic camera app to take photos\n\nSee [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/avcam-building-a-camera-app] to learn how to write a basic camera app to capture videos using an iPhone’s front and rear cameras.\n\n### Configure the DockKit accessory manager\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVCaptureSession] is a singleton class that provides connection and disconnection notifications with a DockKit accessory by subscribing to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessoryManager\/accessoryStateChanges] API.\n\nThe dock control service subscribes to `accessoryStateChanges` in its `setUp(features: DockAccessoryFeatures)` method.\n\n```swift\n\/\/ Subscribe to accessory state changes.\nfor await stateEvent in try DockAccessoryManager.shared.accessoryStateChanges {\n    \/\/ Save the DockKit accessory when docked (connected).\n    if let newAccessory = stateEvent.accessory, stateEvent.state == .docked {\n        dockkitAccessory = newAccessory\n        await setupAccessorySubscriptions(for: newAccessory)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen an accessory connects, DockKit sets it up to use system tracking, and to listen to accessory events and battery states in `setupAccessorySubscriptions(for accesory: DockAccessory)`.\n\n```swift\nfunc setupAccessorySubscriptions(for accesory: DockAccessory) async {\n    \/\/ Enable system tracking on the first connection.\n    try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(true)\n    \/\/ Start the necessary subscriptions to accessory events and battery states.\n    subscribeToAccessoryEvents(for: accesory)\n    toggleBatterySummary(to: true, for: accesory)\n}\n```\n\n### Change the tracking mode\n\nThe app provides a tracking mode menu to switch between system tracking, custom tracking, and manual tracking. The default is system tracking, which the app sets by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessoryManager\/setSystemTrackingEnabled(_:)] to `true`.\n\n```swift\nfunc updateTrackingMode(to trackingMode: TrackingMode) async {\n    self.trackingMode = trackingMode\n    \/\/ Call `systemTrackingEnabled` with `true` to enable the system tracking mode.\n    try await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(trackingMode == .system ? true : false)\n}\n```\n\nThe app provides various menus and options to configure the selected subjects, selected frame, region to track, and more. All menus and buttons primarily live in the main DockKit menu.\n\n### Tap to track the subject\n\nThe app provides a tap-to-track toggle to enable or disable selecting a specific subject to track by tapping the camera view. When the tap-to-track toggle is enabled, the `selectSubject(at point: CGPoint?)` method allows people to select tapped subjects.\n\n```swift\nfunc selectSubject(at point: CGPoint?) async -> Bool {\n    if let point = point {\n        \/\/ Select a specific subject at the point.\n        try await accessory.selectSubject(at: point)\n    } else {\n        \/\/ Clear the selected subjects.\n        try await accessory.selectSubjects([])\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Set the region of interest\n\nThe app provides a region-of-interest toggle to enable or disable setting a region of interest to frame the selected subjects by holding and dragging the camera view. When toggling the region of interest, the `setRegionOfInterest(to region: CGRect)` method allows setting a region [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGRect] in the camera view. The dock accessory keeps the subjects framed in the selected region.\n\n```swift\nfunc setRegionOfInterest(to region: CGRect) async {\n    try await accessory.setRegionOfInterest(region)\n}\n```\n\n### Set the framing mode\n\nThe app provides a framing mode menu to select a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/FramingMode-swift.enum].\n\n```swift\nfunc updateFraming(to framing: FramingMode) async -> Bool {\n    try await accessory.setFramingMode(dockKitFramingMode(from: framing))\n}\n```\n\nThe app uses the helper function `dockKitFramingMode(from: framing)` to map a local `FramingMode` enumeration to `DockAccessory.FramingMode`.\n\n```swift\nfunc dockKitFramingMode(from framingMode: FramingMode) -> DockAccessory.FramingMode {\n    switch framingMode {\n    case .auto:\n        return DockAccessory.FramingMode.automatic\n    case .center:\n        return DockAccessory.FramingMode.center\n    case .left:\n        return DockAccessory.FramingMode.left\n    case .right:\n        return DockAccessory.FramingMode.right\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Implement manual control using actuator velocities\n\nWhen someone sets the `TrackingMode` to `TrackingMode.manual`, the app provides chevrons to move `DockAccessory` up, left, right, and down by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/setAngularVelocity(_:)] API.\n\n```swift\nfunc handleChevronTapped(chevronType: ChevronType, speed: Double = 0.2) async {\n    var velocity = Vector3D()\n    switch chevronType {\n    case .tiltUp:\n        velocity.x = -speed\n        break\n    case .tiltDown:\n        velocity.x = speed\n        break\n    case .panLeft:\n        velocity.y = -speed\n        break\n    case .panRight:\n        velocity.y = speed\n        break\n    }\n    try await dockkitAccessory.setAngularVelocity(velocity)\n}\n```\n\n### Run the default animations\n\nThe app provides buttons to run the four default animations that `DockAccessory` provides. Before running the animation, the app disables system tracking. When the animation is complete, the app restores system tracking to its prior value.\n\n```swift\n\/\/ Disable the system tracking before running the animation.\ntry await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(false)\n\n\/\/ Run the animation and wait for it to finish.\nlet progress = try await dockkitAccessory.animate(motion: dockKitAnimation(from: animation))\nwhile(!progress.isCancelled && !progress.isFinished) {\n    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: NSEC_PER_SEC\/10) \/\/ 0.1 sec\n}\n            \n\/\/ Restore the system tracking after running the animation.\ntry await DockAccessoryManager.shared.setSystemTrackingEnabled(trackingMode == .system ? true : false)\n```\n\nThe app uses the helper function `dockKitAnimation(from animation: Animation)` to map a local animation enumeration to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/Animation].\n\n```swift\nfunc dockKitAnimation(from animation: Animation) -> DockAccessory.Animation {\n    switch animation {\n    case .yes:\n        return DockAccessory.Animation.yes\n    case .nope:\n        return DockAccessory.Animation.nope\n    case .wakeup:\n        return DockAccessory.Animation.wakeup\n    case .kapow:\n        return DockAccessory.Animation.kapow\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe DockKit menu provides toggles to subscribe to various states, like battery and tracking, and displays them in the app’s UI.\n\n### Implement the battery state\n\nThe dock control service subscribes to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/batteryStates-swift.property] to acquire the current battery state of the accessory. The current battery state includes the battery level, charging indicator, and so forth.\n\n```swift\nfor await batterySummaryState in try dockkitAccessory.batteryStates {\n    battery = .available(percentage: batterySummaryState.batteryLevel, charging: batterySummaryState.chargeState == .charging)\n}\n```\n\n### Implement the tracking states\n\nThe dock control service subscribes to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/TrackingStates-swift.struct] to get a list of tracked subjects with attributes like saliency and speaking confidence. The dock control service delegates the handling of the conversion from a normalized subject rectangle to camera view space coordinates to the `CameraModel`, which uses the capture service for the operation. The app uses these states, along with the transformed subject rectangle, to show an overlay on the faces of the subjects.\n\n```swift\nfor await trackingSummaryState in try dockkitAccessory.trackingStates {\n    for subject in trackingSummaryState.trackedSubjects {\n        switch subject {\n        case .person(let person):\n            if let rect = await cameraCaptureDelegate?.convertToViewSpace(from: person.rect) {\n                \/\/ Create a `DockAccessoryTrackedPerson` object from `TrackingState`.\n                trackedPersons.append(DockAccessoryTrackedPerson(saliency: person.saliencyRank, rect: rect,\n                                                                 speaking: person.speakingConfidence, looking: person.lookingAtCameraConfidence))\n            }\n        default:\n            \/\/ Do nothing.\n            break\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Implement camera control using accessory events\n\nThe dock control service subscribes to an `async` stream of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory\/AccessoryEvents-swift.struct]. A physical input on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DockKit\/DockAccessory] triggers an accessory event. When the app receives an accessory event, it delegates handling of the event to the `CameraModel`, which uses the capture service to perform camera operations.\n\n```swift\nfor await event in try accesory.accessoryEvents {\n    switch (event) {\n    case let .button(id, pressed):\n        break\n    case .cameraZoom(factor: let factor):\n        let zoomType = factor > 0 ? CameraZoomType.increase : CameraZoomType.decrease\n        \/\/ Implement the camera zoom.\n        cameraCaptureDelegate?.zoom(type: zoomType, factor: 0.2)\n        break\n    case .cameraShutter:\n        if (Date.now.timeIntervalSince(lastShutterEventTime) > 0.2) {\n            \/\/ Implement the camera start capture or stop capture.\n            cameraCaptureDelegate?.startOrStartCapture()\n            lastShutterEventTime = .now\n        }\n        break\n    case .cameraFlip:\n        \/\/ Implement the camera flip.\n        cameraCaptureDelegate?.switchCamera()\n        break\n    default: break\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`CameraModel` implements the sample’s `CameraCaptureDelegate` protocol and provides the helper methods to control the camera.\n\n### Implement the camera zoom\n\nThe capture service implements the `updateMagnification(for zoomType: CameraZoomType, by scale: Double = 0.2)` method in response to a zoom event from the accessory.\n\n```swift\nfunc updateMagnification(for zoomType: CameraZoomType, by scale: Double = 0.2) {\n    try? currentDevice.lockForConfiguration()\n    let magnification = (zoomType == .increase ? 1.0 : -1.0) * scale\n    var newZoomFactor = currentDevice.videoZoomFactor + magnification\n    newZoomFactor = max(min(newZoomFactor, self.maxZoomFactor), self.minZoomFactor)\n    newZoomFactor = Double(round(10 * newZoomFactor) \/ 10)\n    currentDevice.videoZoomFactor = newZoomFactor\n    currentDevice.unlockForConfiguration()\n    self.zoomFactor = newZoomFactor\n}\n```\n\n### Implement the camera shutter\n\nThe capture service implements the `startRecording()` method in response to a start-capture shutter event, and a `stopRecording()` method in response to a stop-capture shutter event.\n\n```swift\nfunc startRecording() {\n    movieCapture.startRecording()\n}\n\nfunc stopRecording() async throws -> Movie {\n    try await movieCapture.stopRecording()\n}\n```\n\n### Implement the camera flip\n\nThe capture service implements the `selectNextVideoDevice()` method in reponse to the camera flip event.\n\n```swift\nfunc selectNextVideoDevice() {\n    \/\/ Change the session's active capture device.\n    changeCaptureDevice(to: nextDevice)\n}\n```\n\n## Controlling the dock accessory\n\n- **DockAccessoryManager**: Observe the state of dock accessories and enable or disable system tracking.\n- **DockAccessory**: Obtain accessory information and control tracking behavior.\n- **DockKitError**: A list of errors that DockKit sends.\n\n",
