(The country or region name is generated from the country code entry in `address`; see `Address Property`.)\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe formatted address (may include line endings).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe address is formatted based on the address’s country code ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AddressBook\/kABPersonAddressCountryCodeKey]).
