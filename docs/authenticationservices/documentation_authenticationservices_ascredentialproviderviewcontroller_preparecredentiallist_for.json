The service identifier array might be empty, but your extension should still show credentials from which the user can pick.\n\nItems in the array with lower indices represent more specific identifiers for which a credential’s requested. For example, if the array contains identifiers `[m.example.com, example.com]`, the item `m.example.com` represents the more specific service that requires a credential.\n\nWhen the user selects a credential displayed by your view controller, encapsulate the corresponding user and password strings in an [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASPasswordCredential] instance and pass it to the extension context’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialProviderExtensionContext\/completeRequest(withSelectedCredential:completionHandler:)] method:\n\nAlternatively, if the user cancels the operation, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialProviderExtensionContext\/cancelRequest(withError:)] method instead with an error that indicates user cancelation:\n\nAlways provide a way for the user to cancel the operation from your view controller, for example by including a cancel button in the navigation bar.\n\nThe system dismisses your view controller automatically after you call either the completion or cancelation method.",
