The system doesn’t support `PasswordDigest`. The system sends the WS-Trust login using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to the endpoint in the MEX response.\n\nFor more information about federated authentication with WS-Trust, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/authentication-process].\n\n### Receive the WS-Trust login response\n\nThe system loads the SOAP response as XML and validates it, which includes checking that the nonce is correct and the created and expires dates are current. The system then parses the `TokenType` and uses it to set the correct `grant_type` in the platform SSO login request.",
