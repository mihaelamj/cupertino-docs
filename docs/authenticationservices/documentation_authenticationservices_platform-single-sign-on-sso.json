It builds on enterprise SSO capabilities so SSO extensions can also perform single sign-on for apps and websites. It integrates with macOS and doesn’t use JavaScript or render webpages for authentication.\n\nThe system stores the SSO tokens in the keychain and only shares them with the SSO extension. The SSO extension then uses the SSO tokens to authenticate the user to their on-premises apps and on websites as needed. If the SSO tokens are missing, expired, or more than four hours old, platform SSO attempts to refresh or retrieve new tokens from the IdP.\n\nPlatform SSO supports the following authentication methods with an identity provider (IdP):\n\nPlatform SSO can create new local user accounts on demand at the login window using IdP credentials, and also integrate IdP group membership with macOS. You can use network accounts for authorization, and groups can also authorize network accounts.\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DeviceManagement] to securely configure platform SSO, including device and user registration, configuring groups, and managing account permissions.\n\nThe system can also retrieve Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGTs), import them to a credential cache, and optionally share them with the Kerberos SSO extension.",
