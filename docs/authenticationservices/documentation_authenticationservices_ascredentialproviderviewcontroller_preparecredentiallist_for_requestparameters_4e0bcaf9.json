After calling this method, the system presents the view controller to the user.\n\nUse the given `serviceIdentifiers` array to filter or prioritize the credentials to display. The service identifier array might be empty, but your extension should still show credentials from which the user can pick.\n\nItems in the array with lower indices represent more specific identifiers for which a credential’s requested. For example, if the array contains identifiers `[m.example.com, example.com]`, the item `m.example.com` represents the more specific service that requires a credential.\n\nIf the person selects a passkey credential, use the `requestParameters` object to complete the request using the selected credential.",
