In Xcode, click the project’s target, then select your team from the Team pop-up menu in the Signing & Capabilities pane to let Xcode automatically manage your provisioning profile.\n2. Add the Associated Domains capability using the + Capability button in the same pane, and specify your domain with the `webcredentials` service.\n3. Ensure an `apple-app-site-association` (AASA) file is present on your domain in the `.well-known` directory, and that it contains an entry for this app’s App ID for the `webcredentials` service.\n4. In the `SignUpView.swift` file, replace all occurrences of `example.com` with the name of your domain.\n\n## Passkeys\n\n- **Public-Private Key Authentication**: Register and authenticate users with passkeys and security keys, without using passwords.\n- **Passkey use in web browsers**: Register and authenticate website users by using passkeys.\n- **Connecting to a service with passkeys**: Allow users to sign in to a service without typing a password.\n\n",
