for users to log into apps and services.\n\n## Overview\n\nUse the Authentication Services framework to improve the experience of users when they enter credentials to establish their identity.\n\n- Give users the ability to sign into your services with their Apple ID.\n- Enable users to look up their stored passwords from within the sign-in flow of an app.\n- Provide a passwordless registration and authentication workflow for apps and websites using iCloud Keychain or a physical security key.\n- Perform automatic security upgrades from weak to strong passwords, or upgrade to using Sign in with Apple.\n- Share data between an app and a web browser using technologies like OAuth to leverage existing web-based logins in the app.\n- Create a single sign-on (SSO) experience in an enterprise app.\n\nSimple and straightforward sign-up and sign-in flows reduce the burden on the user to remember passwords, which may improve security.\n\n## Authorization requests\n\n- **ASAuthorizationController**: A controller that manages authorization requests that a provider creates.\n- **AuthorizationController**: A SwiftUI environment value that views use to perform authorization requests.\n- **ASAuthorizationResult**: Describes the outcome of a successful authorization request.\n\n## Sign In with Apple\n\n- **Implementing User Authentication with Sign in with Apple**: Provide a way for users of your app to set up an account and start using your services.\n- **Simplifying User Authentication in a tvOS App**: Build a fluid sign-in experience for your tvOS apps using AuthenticationServices.\n- **SignInWithAppleButton**: A SwiftUI view that creates the Sign in with Apple button for display.\n- **Sign in with Apple Entitlement**: An entitlement that lets your app use Sign in with Apple.\n- **ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider**: A mechanism for generating requests to authenticate users based on their Apple ID.\n- **ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential**: A credential that results from a successful Apple ID authentication.\n\n## Passwords\n\n- **Password AutoFill**: Streamline your app’s login and onboarding procedures.\n- **ASAuthorizationPasswordProvider**: A mechanism for generating requests to perform keychain credential sharing.\n- **ASPasswordCredential**: A password credential.\n- **Password use in web browsers**: Register and authenticate website users by using passwords.\n\n## Passkeys\n\n- **Public-Private Key Authentication**: Register and authenticate users with passkeys and security keys, without using passwords.\n- **Passkey use in web browsers**: Register and authenticate website users by using passkeys.\n- **Performing fast account creation with passkeys**: Allow people to quickly create an account with passkeys and associated domains.\n- **Connecting to a service with passkeys**: Allow users to sign in to a service without typing a password.\n\n## Web authentication sessions\n\n- **Authenticating a User Through a Web Service**: Use a web authentication session to authenticate a user in your app.\n- **Securing Logins with iCloud Keychain Verification Codes**: Use time-based codes generated on-device for a secure authentication experience.\n- **ASWebAuthenticationSession**: A session that an app uses to authenticate a user through a web service.\n- **WebAuthenticationSession**: A SwiftUI environment value that views use to authenticate someone using a web service.\n- **Supporting Single Sign-On in a Web Browser App**: Extend your web browser app to handle web authentication requests from other apps.\n- **ASWebAuthenticationSessionWebBrowserSessionManager**: A session manager that mediates sharing data between an app and a web browser.\n- **ASWebAuthenticationSessionWebBrowserSupportCapabilities**: A collection of keys that a browser app uses to declare its ability to handle authentication requests from other apps.\n\n## AutoFill credentials\n\n- **Providing one-time passcodes to AutoFill**: Help people efficiently perform multifactor authentication.\n- **AutoFill Credential Provider Entitlement**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the app may, with user permission, provide user names and passwords for AutoFill in Safari and other apps.\n- **ASCredentialProviderViewController**: A view controller that a credential manager app uses to extend AutoFill.\n\n## Credential migration\n\n- **ASCredentialExportManager**: A class to manage exporting credentials.\n- **ASCredentialImportManager**: A class to manage importing credentials.\n\n## Single sign-on (SSO)\n\n- **Enterprise single sign-on (SSO)**\n- **Platform single sign-on (SSO)**: Use credentials from macOS login to perform single sign-on with an identity provider.\n\n## Apple TV authentication\n\n- **customAuthorizationMethods**: An array of custom authorization methods for the user to choose.\n- **authorizationController(_:didCompleteWithCustomMethod:)**: Informs the delegate when authorization completes, and specifies the custom method the user selected.\n- **ASAuthorizationCustomMethod**: The custom authorization method.\n\n## Automatic security upgrades\n\n- **Upgrading Account Security With an Account Authentication Modification Extension**: Automatically and transparently convert accounts to Sign in with Apple or to use strong passwords for improved security.\n- **ASAccountAuthenticationModificationController**: An object that performs a request to modify an account’s authentication properties.\n- **ASAccountAuthenticationModificationViewController**: A view controller that can upgrade user passwords to strong passwords, or convert accounts to use Sign in with Apple.\n- **ASAccountAuthenticationModificationExtensionContext**: An object that you interact with to change an account’s password or to upgrade to Sign in with Apple.\n\n## Updating credential managers\n\n- **ASCredentialUpdater**: A class to pass credential update events to credential managers enabled on the system.\n\n## Reference\n\n- **AuthenticationServices Enumerations**\n- **AuthenticationServices Data Types**\n\n## Classes\n\n- **ASAuthorizationAccountCreationPlatformPublicKeyCredential**\n- **ASAuthorizationAccountCreationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialRequest**\n- **ASAuthorizationAccountCreationProvider**\n- **ASAuthorizationProviderExtensionUserLoginConfiguration**\n- **ASCredentialDataManager**: This class allows submitting credentials and events to any credential manager enabled on the system.\n- **ASGeneratePasswordsRequest**\n- **ASGeneratedPassword**\n- **ASOneTimeCodeCredentialIdentity**\n- **ASSavePasswordRequest**\n\n## Structures\n\n- **ASAuthorizationProviderExtensionEncryptionAlgorithm**\n- **ASAuthorizationProviderExtensionSigningAlgorithm**\n- **ASAutoFillURLScope**: This structure represents the subset of URL components supported for the AutoFill of credentials.\n- **ASEmailIdentifier**\n- **ASImportableCredentialScope**: The scope for where a credential should be usable.\n- **ASImportableEditableField**: A field that someone can edit within a credential.\n- **ASPhoneNumberIdentifier**\n- **ASPublicKeyCredentialClientData**\n- **CredentialDataManager**\n\n## Variables\n\n- **ASCredentialExchangeActivity**: The activity type used in user activity objects sent to importing apps.\n- **ASCredentialImportToken**: The key for the token in the user info dictionary of the user activity sent to importing apps.\n\n## Enumerations\n\n- **ASContactIdentifier**\n- **ASContactIdentifierRequest**\n\n",
