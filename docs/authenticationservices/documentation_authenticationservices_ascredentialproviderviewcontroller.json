The various “report” methods of [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialUpdater] work like the “signal” methods of `PublicKeyCredential` when using WebAuthn on the web. For example, a website or app can notify credential manager apps that it updated a user name or email for a given account, allowing the manager to stay consistent with the website.\n\nYour credential manager manager receives these updates in the “report” methods of `ASCredentialProviderViewController`.

Add a Credential Provider Extension target to your project that subclasses [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialProviderViewController]. Add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.authentication-services.autofill-credential-provider] to both the extension and its containing app.\n2. Override the view controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialProviderViewController\/prepareCredentialList(for:)] method to prepare a view with a list of credentials that the person can choose from after opening your extension from the AutoFill suggestions list.\n3. Optionally add [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASPasswordCredentialIdentity] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASPasskeyCredentialIdentity] instances to the shared [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialIdentityStore] to make identities available directly in the AutoFill suggestions list. Then override the [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialProviderViewController\/provideCredentialWithoutUserInteraction(for:)-3mo23] method to provide the associated credentials when the person taps a suggestion.\n4. Optionally, override the [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialProviderViewController\/prepareInterfaceForExtensionConfiguration()] method to specify a configuration interface that you can show when people first enable your credentials manager in Settings.\n\n### Receiving credential updates\n\nApps and websites that allow sign-ins can signal updates to the operating system with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialUpdater] class.

In this case, the manager should stop showing the user name and password for that domain.\n\n\n\n## Getting the extension context\n\n- **extensionContext**: The context your credential provider
