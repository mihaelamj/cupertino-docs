  "overview" : "## Overview\n\n`ASCredentialImportManager` allows your app to exchange authentication credentials such as passwords and passkeys with other apps. Participating apps, such as password managers, export credentials to your app by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialExportManager] class.\n\n### Configuring your app\n\nTo participate in credential exchange, edit your credential provider extension’s information property list and add the following key with a Boolean value of `YES`:\n\n`NSExtension > NSExtensionAttributes > ASCredentialProviderExtensionCapabilities > SupportsCredentialExchange`\n\nAlso, declare the versions of the credential data format your app supports using the following key:\n\n`NSExtension > NSExtensionAttributes > ASCredentialProviderExtensionCapabilities > SupportedCredentialExchangeVersions`\n\nThe value is an array of strings containing every version your app supports. Currently, the only available version is `1.0`.\n\n### Importing credentials\n\nCredential export begins when another app calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialExportManager\/exportCredentials(_:)], which brings up a system UI to choose an app to export to. When the person using the export app chooses your app to receive the credentials, the system launches your app and sends an  [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] whose [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/activityType] is `ASCredentialExchangeActivity`. To support this process, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSUserActivityTypes] array to your app’s information property list and add the item `ASCredentialExchangeActivityType` to the array.\n\nYour app needs to prepare for the system launching the app from this activity by fetching the `ASCredentialImportToken` from the activity’s  [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/userInfo] dictionary. The value of this key is a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UUID] token; create an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialImportManager] and pass the token to [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialImportManager\/importCredentials(token:)] to begin the import process.\n\nThe following example shows how a SwiftUI app handles launching from the user activity and beginning the credential import process.\n\nFor a corresponding export code example, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.authenticationservices\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASCredentialExportManager].",
