Credentials not present in the `acceptedCredentialIDs` may be removed or hidden by a password manager. Relying party may choose to perform this periodically, e.g. on every sign in. This information is shared with all password managers enabled in the system.\n- **reportPublicKeyCredentialUpdate(relyingPartyIdentifier:userHandle:newName:)**: Report an update to a credential’s name, such as when changing the user name on an account. This information is shared with all password managers enabled in the system.\n- **reportUnknownPublicKeyCredential(relyingPartyIdentifier:credentialID:)**: Report that a specific credential is unknown or no longer accepted. The credential may be removed or hidden by a password manager. This information is shared with all password managers enabled in the system.\n- **reportUnusedPasswordCredential(domain:userName:)**: Report an unused password credential for a given domain and username. Password managers may remove or hide the password credential. This information is shared with all password managers enabled in the system.\n- **save(password:for:title:anchor:)**: Save or update a password credential to the user’s preferred password manager in the system.\n\n",
