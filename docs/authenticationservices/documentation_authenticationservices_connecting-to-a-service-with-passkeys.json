Open the sample with Xcode 14 or later.\n2. Select the Shiny project.\n3. For the project’s target, select your team from the Team drop-down menu in the Signing & Capabilities pane to let Xcode automatically manage your provisioning profile.\n4. Add the Associated Domains capability using the “+ Capability” button in the same pane, and specify your domain with the `webcredentials` service.\n5. Ensure an `apple-app-site-association` (AASA) file is present on your domain in the `.well-known` directory, and that it contains an entry for this app’s App ID for the `webcredentials` service.\n6. In the `AccountManager.swift` file, replace all occurrences of `example.com` with the name of your domain.\n\n## Passkeys\n\n- **Public-Private Key Authentication**: Register and authenticate users with passkeys and security keys, without using passwords.\n- **Passkey use in web browsers**: Register and authenticate website users by using passkeys.\n- **Performing fast account creation with passkeys**: Allow people to quickly create an account with passkeys and associated domains.\n\n",
