In iOS 17 and later, the picker controller ignores touch events while its opacity is anything other than fully opaque.\n- As a system-rendered UI, you can’t subclass [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/PhotosUI\/PHPickerViewController]. Its view hierarchy belongs to the system and therefore, the framework provides no access.\n\n## Creating a picker\n\n- **init(configuration:)**: Creates a new picker view controller with the configuration you specify.\n- **PHPickerConfiguration**: An object that contains information about how to configure a picker view controller.\n\n## Managing the configuration\n\n- **configuration**: The configuration you specify when creating the picker.\n- **updatePicker(using:)**: Customizes your app’s photo picker according to the given configuration.\n\n## Setting content position and scale\n\n- **scrollToInitialPosition()**: Resets the visible photo thumbnails by scrolling the view to the picker’s initial position.\n- **zoomIn()**: Changes the picker’s content scale by making the photo thumbnails larger in the view.\n- **zoomOut()**: Changes the picker’s content scale by making the photo thumbnails smaller in the view.\n\n## Responding to user selection\n\n- **delegate**: The picker’s delegate object.\n- **PHPickerViewControllerDelegate**: A set of methods that the delegate must implement to respond to `PHPickerViewController` user events.\n- **PHPickerResult**: Types that represent a selected asset from the user’s photo library.\n\n## Deselecting assets\n\n- **deselectAssets(withIdentifiers:)**: Deselects assets that are in a selected state.\n\n## Reordering assets\n\n- **moveAsset(withIdentifier:afterAssetWithIdentifier:)**: Reorders assets that are in a selected state.\n\n## Photos picker for UIKit, AppKit\n\n- **Selecting Photos and Videos in iOS**: Improve the user experience of finding and selecting assets by using the Photos picker.\n- **PHPickerViewControllerDelegate**: A set of methods that the delegate must implement to respond to `PHPickerViewController` user events.\n- **PHPickerConfiguration**: An object that contains information about how to configure a picker view controller.\n- **PHPickerFilter**: A type that defines the filter to apply to the photo library.\n- **PHPickerResult**: Types that represent a selected asset from the user’s photo library.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSViewController\n- UIViewController\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSCoding\n- NSEditor\n- NSExtensionRequestHandling\n- NSObjectProtocol\n- NSSeguePerforming\n- NSStandardKeyBindingResponding\n- NSTouchBarProvider\n- NSUserActivityRestoring\n- NSUserInterfaceItemIdentification\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n- UIActivityItemsConfigurationProviding\n- UIAppearanceContainer\n- UIContentContainer\n- UIFocusEnvironment\n- UIPasteConfigurationSupporting\n- UIResponderStandardEditActions\n- UIStateRestoring\n- UITraitChangeObservable\n- UITraitEnvironment\n- UIUserActivityRestoring\n\n",
