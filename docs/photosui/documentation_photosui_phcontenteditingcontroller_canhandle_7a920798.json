This object provides whatever information is necessary to reconstruct the edited asset using the previous version of the asset’s content. When a user attempts to edit an asset with your extension, Photos calls this block to learn whether your extension can handle the asset’s past adjustments.\n\nIf you return `true` from this method, Photos provides the previous asset version for editing. Your extension uses the adjustment data to alter, add to, or reapply the last edit. (For example, an adjustment data may describe filters applied to a photo. Your extension reapplies those filters and allows the user to change filter parameters, add new filters, or remove filters.)\n\nIf you return `false` from this method, Photos provides the most recent asset data—the rendered output of the previous edit—for editing.\n\nFor more information, see `Working with Asset Versions and Adjustments`.",
