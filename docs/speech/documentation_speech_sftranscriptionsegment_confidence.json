The value is `0` if there was no recognition, and it is closer to `1` when there is a high certainty that a transcription matches the user’s speech exactly. For example, a confidence value of `0.94` represents a very high confidence level, and is more likely to be correct than a transcription with a confidence value of `0.72`.",
