For example, use this request object to route audio from a device’s microphone to the speech recognizer.\n\nThe request object contains no audio initially. As you capture audio, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest\/append(_:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest\/appendAudioSampleBuffer(_:)] to add audio samples to the request object. The speech recognizer continuously analyzes the audio you appended, stopping only when you call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest\/endAudio()] method. You must call [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest\/endAudio()] explicitly to stop the speech recognition process.\n\nFor a complete example of how to use audio buffers with speech recognition, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/samplecode\/SpeakToMe\/Introduction\/Intro.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40017110].",
