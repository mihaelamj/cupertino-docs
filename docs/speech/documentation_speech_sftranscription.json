An *utterance* is a vocalized word or group of words that represent a single meaning to the speech recognizer ([doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognizer]).\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFTranscription\/formattedString] property to retrieve the entire transcription of utterances, or use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFTranscription\/segments] property to retrieve an individual utterance ([doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFTranscriptionSegment]).\n\nYou don’t create an `SFTranscription` directly. Instead, you retrieve it from an [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognitionResult] instance. The speech recognizer sends a speech recognition result to your app in one of two ways, depending on how your app started a speech recognition task.\n\nYou can start a speech recognition task by using the speech recognizer’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognizer\/recognitionTask(with:resultHandler:)] method. When the task is complete, the speech recognizer sends an [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognitionResult] instance to your `resultHandler` closure. Alternatively, you can use the speech recognizer’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognizer\/recognitionTask(with:delegate:)] method to start a speech recognition task. When the task is complete, the speech recognizer uses your [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognitionTaskDelegate] to send an [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognitionResult] by using the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognitionTaskDelegate\/speechRecognitionTask(_:didFinishRecognition:)] method.\n\nAn `SFTranscription` represents only a potential version of the speech.
