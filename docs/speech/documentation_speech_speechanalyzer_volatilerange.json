If there aren’t any pending results and the modules aren’t supplying volatile results—if all the previously-sent results are final—the volatile range is empty.\n\nA module is not required to provide new, final results for audio ranges that were previously volatile but otherwise unchanged by finalization. However, you can create two modules—one that provides both volatile and final results, and a second that only provides final results—and process results from the latter differently.\n\nThe volatile range is `nil` if no input has been received.",
