If the analyzer hasn’t already taken that audio from the input sequence, the method waits until analysis proceeds to that audio before finalizing.\n\nIf `nil`, finalizes up to and including the last audio the analyzer *has* taken from the input sequence, and if the analyzer has not taken any audio from the input sequence, this method does nothing.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAt the return of this method, input up to and including the given time will have been analyzed. Modules will have published the finalized results to their stream, but the application may not have consumed them from the stream yet.
