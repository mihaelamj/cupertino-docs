In particular, there is no guarantee that this result will be reissued with this property set to `true`.\n\nEquivalent to `resultsFinalizationTime >= range.end`.\n\n## Getting finalization state\n\n- **resultsFinalizationTime**: The audio input time up to which results from this module have been finalized (after this result).
