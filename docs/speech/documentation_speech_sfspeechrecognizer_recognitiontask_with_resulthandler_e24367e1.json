If the [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognitionRequest\/shouldReportPartialResults] property is `true`, this block may be called multiple times to deliver the partial and final results. The block has no return value and takes the following parameters:\n\n\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe task object you can use to manage an in-progress recognition request.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to initiate the speech recognition process on the audio contained in the request object. This method executes asynchronously and returns a [doc:\/\/com.apple.speech\/documentation\/Speech\/SFSpeechRecognitionTask] object that you can use to cancel or finalize the recognition process later. As results become available, the method calls the block in the `resultHandler` parameter.\n\n## Performing speech recognition on audio\n\n- **recognitionTask(with:delegate:)**: Recognizes speech from the audio source associated with the specified request, using the specified delegate to manage the results.\n- **SFSpeechRecognitionTaskDelegate**: A protocol with methods for managing multi-utterance speech recognition requests.\n\n",
