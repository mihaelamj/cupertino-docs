If this argument is `true` and the known issue does not occur, no secondary issue is recorded.\n- **isolation**: The actor to which `body` is isolated, if any.\n- **sourceLocation**: The source location to which any recorded issues should be attributed.\n- **body**: The function to invoke.\n- **precondition**: A function that determines if issues are known to occur during the execution of `body`. If this function returns `true`, encountered issues that are matched by `issueMatcher` are considered to be known issues; if this function returns `false`, `issueMatcher` is not called and they are treated as unknown.\n- **issueMatcher**: A function to invoke when an issue occurs that is used to determine if the issue is known to occur. By default, all issues match.\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n\nUse this function when a test is known to record one or more issues that should not cause the test to fail, or if a precondition affects whether issues are known to occur. For example:\n\n```swift\n@Test func example() async throws {\n  try await withKnownIssue {\n    try await flakyCall()\n  } when: {\n    callsAreFlakyOnThisPlatform()\n  } matching: { issue in\n    issue.error is FileNotFoundError\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt is not necessary to specify both `precondition` and `issueMatcher` if only one is relevant.
