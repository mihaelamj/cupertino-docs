You express the duration in minutes, with a minimum duration of one minute.\n\nWhen you associate this trait with a test, that test must complete within a time limit of, at most, `timeLimit`. If the test runs longer, the testing library records a [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/Issue\/Kind-swift.enum\/timeLimitExceeded(timeLimitComponents:)] issue, which it treats as a test failure.\n\nThe testing library can use a shorter time limit than that specified by `timeLimit` if you configure it to enforce a maximum per-test limit. When you configure a maximum per-test limit, the time limit of the test this trait is applied to is the shorter of `timeLimit` and the maximum per-test limit. For information on configuring maximum per-test limits, consult the documentation for the tool you use to run your tests.\n\nIf a test is parameterized, this time limit is applied to each of its test cases individually. If a test has more than one time limit associated with it, the testing library uses the shortest time limit.\n\nIf you apply this trait to a test suite, then it sets the time limit for each test in the suite, or each test case in parameterized tests in the suite. For example, if a suite contains five tests and you apply a time limit trait with a duration of one minute, then each test in the suite may run for up to one minute.",
