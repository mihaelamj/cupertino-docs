If `expression` could throw *any* error, or the specific type of thrown error is unimportant, pass `(any Error).self`.\n- **comment**: A comment describing the expectation.\n- **sourceLocation**: The source location to which recorded expectations and issues should be attributed.\n- **expression**: The expression to be evaluated.\n\n## Return Value\n\nIf the expectation passes, the instance of `errorType` that was thrown by `expression`. If the expectation fails, the result is `nil`.\n\n## Overview\n\nUse this overload of `#expect()` when the expression `expression` *should* throw an error of a given type:\n\n```swift\n#expect(throws: EngineFailureError.self) {\n  FoodTruck.shared.engine.batteryLevel = 0\n  try FoodTruck.shared.engine.start()\n}\n```\n\nIf `expression` does not throw an error, or if it throws an error that is not an instance of `errorType`, an [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/Issue] is recorded for the test that is running in the current task.
