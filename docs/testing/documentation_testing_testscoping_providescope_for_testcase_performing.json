When invoked on a suite, the value of this argument is `nil`.\n- **function**: The function to perform. If `test` represents a test suite, this function encapsulates running all the tests in that suite. If `test` represents a test function, this function is the body of that test function (including all cases if the test function is parameterized.)\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n\nWhen the testing library prepares to run a test, it starts by finding all traits applied to that test, including those inherited from containing suites.
