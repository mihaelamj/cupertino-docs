If the sub-suites have children, they also run serially.\n\nThis trait does not affect the execution of a test relative to its peers or to unrelated tests. This trait has no effect if you disable test parallelization globally (for example, by passing `--no-parallel` to the `swift test` command.)\n\nTo add this trait to a test, use [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/Trait\/serialized].",
