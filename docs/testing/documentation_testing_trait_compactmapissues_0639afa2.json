The closure is passed the recorded issue, and if it returns a non-`nil` value, that will be recorded instead of the original. Otherwise, if the closure returns `nil`, the issue is suppressed and will not be included in the results.\n\nThe `transform` closure may be called more than once if the test records multiple issues. If more than one instance of this trait is applied to a test (including via inheritance from a containing suite), the `transform` closure for each instance will be called in right-to-left, innermost-to- outermost order, unless `nil` is returned, which will skip invoking the remaining traits’ closures.\n\nWithin `transform`, you may access the current test or test case (if any) using [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/Test\/current] [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/Test\/Case\/current], respectively.
