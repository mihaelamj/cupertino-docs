When `test` represents a suite, the value of this argument is `nil`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA value conforming to [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/Trait\/TestScopeProvider] which you use to provide custom scoping for `test` or `testCase`. Returns `nil` if the trait doesn’t provide any custom scope for the test or test case.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf this trait’s type conforms to [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/TestScoping], the default value returned by this method depends on the values of`test` and `testCase`:\n\n- If `test` represents a suite, this trait must conform to [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/SuiteTrait]. If the value of this suite trait’s [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/SuiteTrait\/isRecursive] property is `true`, then this method returns `nil`, and the suite trait provides its custom scope once for each test function the test suite contains. If the value of [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/SuiteTrait\/isRecursive] is `false`, this method returns `self`, and the suite trait provides its custom scope once for the entire test suite.\n- If `test` represents a test function, this trait also conforms to [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/TestTrait]. If `testCase` is `nil`, this method returns `nil`; otherwise, it returns `self`. This means that by default, a trait which is applied to or inherited by a test function provides its custom scope once for each of that function’s cases.\n\nA trait may override this method to further customize the default behaviors above. For example, if a trait needs to provide custom test scope both once per-suite and once per-test function in that suite, it implements the method to return a non-`nil` scope provider under those conditions.\n\nA trait may also implement this method and return `nil` if it determines that it does not need to provide a custom scope for a particular test at runtime, even if the test has the trait applied. This can improve performance and make diagnostics clearer by avoiding an unnecessary call to [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/TestScoping\/provideScope(for:testCase:performing:)].\n\nIf this trait’s type does not conform to [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/TestScoping] and its associated [doc:\/\/org.swift.testing\/documentation\/Testing\/Trait\/TestScopeProvider] type is the default `Never`, then this method returns `nil` by default. This means that instances of this trait don’t provide a custom scope for tests to which they’re applied.\n\n## Running code before and after a test or suite\n\n- **TestScoping**: A protocol that tells the test runner to run custom code before or after it runs a test suite or test function.\n- **TestScopeProvider**: The type of the test scope provider for this trait.\n- **prepare(for:)**: Prepare to run the test that has this trait.\n\n",
