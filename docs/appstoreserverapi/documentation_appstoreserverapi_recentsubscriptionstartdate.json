The start date includes any free trials or promotional purchases. If no such gap exists — for example, if the user has only ever purchased one subscription — the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/recentSubscriptionStartDate] is the same as the subscription’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/originalPurchaseDate].\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/recentSubscriptionStartDate] calculation counts a grace period or a billing retry state as a gap in the paid service.\n\nThis date applies to active or expired subscriptions.
