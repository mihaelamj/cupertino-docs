The request limits apply per app.\n\nThe following table lists the rate limits for each endpoint in the production environment, expressed in requests per second. The system enforces rate limits on an hourly basis.\n\n\n\nThe rate limits in the sandbox environment are 10% of the limits in the table above.\n\nThe App Store server may make adjustments to reduce or increase these rate limits as needed at any time.\n\n### Handle exceeded rate limits gracefully\n\nIf you exceed a per-hour limit, the API rejects the request with an `HTTP` `429` response, with a [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/RateLimitExceededError] in the body.  Consider the following as you integrate the API:\n\n- If you periodically call the API, throttle your requests to avoid exceeding the per-hour limit for an endpoint.\n- Manage the `HTTP` `429` [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/RateLimitExceededError] in your error-handling process. For example, log the failure and queue the job to process it again at a later time.\n- Check the `Retry-After` header if you receive the `HTTP` `429` error. This header contains a UNIX time, in milliseconds, that informs you when you can next send a request.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Simplifying your implementation by using the App Store Server Library**: Use Apple’s open source library to create JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authorize your calls, verify transactions, extract transaction identifiers from receipts, and more.\n- **Creating API keys to authorize API requests**: Create API keys you use to sign JSON Web Tokens and authorize API requests.\n- **Generating JSON Web Tokens for API requests**: Create JSON Web Tokens signed with your private key to authorize requests for App Store Server API and External Purchase Server API.\n- **App Store Server API changelog**: Learn about new features and updates in the App Store Server API.\n\n",
