Each response includes a [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/RefundHistoryResponse\/revision] token. Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Refund-History] again with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/RefundHistoryResponse\/revision] token in the query to receive the next set of transactions. When the App Store has no more transactions to send, the `hasMore` value is `false`.\n\nConsider storing the `revision` token from the last page of results with other customer account information. Use it at a later date when you call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Refund-History] to request any new refunded transactions since the last time you called the endpoint for the customer. By using the stored `revision` token, you can avoid fetching transactions you’ve already received.",
