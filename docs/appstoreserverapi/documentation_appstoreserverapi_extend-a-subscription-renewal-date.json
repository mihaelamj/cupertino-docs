In the request body, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/ExtendRenewalDateRequest], provide the extension duration, the reason code for the extension, and a unique [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/requestIdentifier] for each extension request.\n\nWhen this endpoint extends eligible purchased subscriptions that support Family Sharing, it automatically extends the family members’ subscriptions as well. However, the endpoint doesn’t support requests to extend a family member’s subscription directly.\n\nA successful response with an `HTTP` `200` status code contains the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/ExtendRenewalDateResponse] object. The response object includes the same unique request identifier you provide in the request, and information you need to determine whether the extension succeeds. For successful extensions, the new subscription expiration date is the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/effectiveDate]. All status codes other than `HTTP` `200` indicate that the request failed.\n\nAfter a successful renewal date extension, Apple sends an email to notify the customer of their updated subscription renewal date.\n\nFor more information about this and related endpoints, including subscription eligibility, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/extending-the-renewal-date-for-auto-renewable-subscriptions].",
