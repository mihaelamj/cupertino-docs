It makes adopting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI] and working with JSON Web Signature (JWS) transactions easier. Find the App Store Server Library for each language in the following GitHub repositories:\n\n- Swift: [https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/app-store-server-library-swift]\n- Java: [https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/app-store-server-library-java]\n- Python: [https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/app-store-server-library-python]\n- Node: [https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/app-store-server-library-node]\n\nChoose the language that best supports your server and expertise.\n\nThe App Store Server Library offers the following capabilities:\n\n- An API client that encodes [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI] requests, decodes the responses, and creates the JSON Web Token (JWT) you use to authenticate the calls. For more information on using JWTs, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/generating-json-web-tokens-for-api-requests].\n- Functions that verify JWS transactions, to verify that Apple signed the transaction data you get in API responses, from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/App-Store-Server-Notifications-V2] and from devices using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit]. See the functions `verifyAndDecodeTransaction`, `verifyAndDecodeAppTransaction`, and `verifyAndDecodeRenewalInfo`, available in each language the library supports.\n- A utility that extracts transaction identifiers from receipts. The App Store Server API endpoints take a transaction identifier in the path parameter. Use this utility as you migrate from using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/appstorereceipts\/verifyreceipt] with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts] to using the App Store Server API for transaction information.\n- A function that generates JWS signatures, which you use in your app for promotional offer signatures, Advanced Commerce API in-app requests, and introductory offer eligibility. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/generating-jws-to-sign-app-store-requests].\n\nFor more information, see the WWDC23 session [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2023\/10143\/].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Creating API keys to authorize API requests**: Create API keys you use to sign JSON Web Tokens and authorize API requests.\n- **Generating JSON Web Tokens for API requests**: Create JSON Web Tokens signed with your private key to authorize requests for App Store Server API and External Purchase Server API.\n- **Identifying rate limits**: Recognize the rate limits that apply to App Store Server API endpoints and handle them in your code.\n- **App Store Server API changelog**: Learn about new features and updates in the App Store Server API.\n\n",
