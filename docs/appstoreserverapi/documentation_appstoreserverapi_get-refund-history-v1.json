For more information about product types, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/in-app-purchase\/].\n\nThe information in the response is the same as the information in one or more `REFUND` notifications ([doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/notificationType]) from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications]. Use this API to retrieve any refund notifications you may have missed, such as during a server outage.\n\nA successful response may have an empty `signedTransactions` array if the customer hasn’t received any App Store-approved refunds. To identify the date and reason code for a refund, see `revocationDate` and `revocationReason` in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/JWSTransactionDecodedPayload].\n\nThe App Store Server API returns information based on the customer’s in-app purchase history regardless of whether the customer installs, removes, or reinstalls the app on their devices.",
