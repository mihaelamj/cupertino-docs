The in-app purchase is considered fully consumed.\n- Scenario 2: If your app has an exchange platform that has bartering, or if your app transferred an in-app purchase from one account to another user’s account, the in-app purchase is considered fully consumed.\n\n## Consumption Data Types\n\n- **accountTenure**: The age of the customer’s account.\n- **appAccountToken**: The UUID that you generate to associate a customer’s In-App Purchase with its resulting App Store transaction.\n- **customerConsented**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the customer consented to provide consumption data to the App Store.\n- **deliveryStatus**: A value that indicates whether the app successfully delivered an in-app purchase that works properly.\n- **lifetimeDollarsPurchased**: A value that indicates the dollar amount of in-app purchases the customer has made in your app, since purchasing the app, across all platforms.\n- **lifetimeDollarsRefunded**: A value that indicates the dollar amount of refunds the customer has received in your app, since purchasing the app, across all platforms.\n- **platform**: The platform on which the customer consumed the in-app purchase.\n- **playTime**: A value that indicates the amount of time that the customer used the app.\n- **refundPreference**: A value that indicates your preferred outcome for the refund request.\n- **sampleContentProvided**: A Boolean value that indicates whether you provided, prior to its purchase, a free sample or trial of the content, or information about its functionality.\n- **userStatus**: The status of a customer’s account within your app.\n\n",
