  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf your service experiences a temporary outage, canceled event, or interruption to a live streamed event, you may choose to compensate your customers by extending the renewal date of their paid, active subscription. The App Store Server API provides two endpoints for requesting such extensions:\n\nYou can move the renewal date for active auto-renewable subscriptions up to 90 days into the future if your service experiences an unexpected outage. To give you flexibility to resolve service issues or outages, you can extend the renewal date twice within a year (365 days) per customer.\n\nAfter a successful renewal date extension, Apple sends an email to notify the customer of their updated subscription renewal date.\n\n### Determine eligible subscriptions\n\nOnly active auto-renewable subscriptions with at least one previously paid period are eligible to have a renewal date extension.\n\nThe following types of subscriptions aren’t eligible for renewal date extensions:\n\nThe App Store attempts to extend the renewal dates for eligible subscriptions only.\n\nWhen the system extends eligible purchased subscriptions that support Family Sharing, it automatically extends the family members’ subscriptions as well. However, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-a-Subscription-Renewal-Date] endpoint doesn’t support requests to extend a family member’s subscription directly.\n\n### Extend renewal dates for one or many subscribers\n\nTo request a renewal date extension for all eligible subscribers, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-Subscription-Renewal-Dates-for-All-Active-Subscribers] endpoint. You indicate the subscription by its [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/productId]. This endpoint is convenient for applying the renewal date extension to a large number of subscriptions with just one call. If a server outage affects some regions and not others, you can limit the request by storefront by including the optional `storefrontCountryCodes` property in the request body, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/MassExtendRenewalDateRequest].\n\nTo request a renewal date extension for a single subscriber, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-a-Subscription-Renewal-Date] endpoint. You identify the subscription with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/originalTransactionId]. Use this endpoint to retry a renewal date extension that fails with the other endpoint, as the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/extending-the-renewal-date-for-auto-renewable-subscriptions#Retry-attempts-that-fail] section below describes.\n\n### Receive in-progress and summary notifications\n\nRequests to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-Subscription-Renewal-Dates-for-All-Active-Subscribers] endpoint can take hours or days to complete, depending on the number of subscribers. The App Store server sends real-time notifications as it processes your request. The notifications inform you as each renewal date extension succeeds or fails, as well as when your request is complete.\n\nTo receive notifications, support [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/App-Store-Server-Notifications-V2] on your server. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/enabling-app-store-server-notifications].\n\nThe following table lists the notifications and their [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/notificationType] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/subtype] values:\n\nFor more information about the contents of a notification payload, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responseBodyV2DecodedPayload].\n\nFor requests to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-a-Subscription-Renewal-Date] endpoint, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications] sends a `RENEWAL_EXTENDED` notification when the request succeeds. The endpoint returns more information in its response body, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/ExtendRenewalDateResponse].\n\n### Check whether a request is complete\n\nTo check whether your request to [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-Subscription-Renewal-Dates-for-All-Active-Subscribers] is complete, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Status-of-Subscription-Renewal-Date-Extensions] endpoint. Complete requests include the final count of successful and failed renewal date extensions. If you don’t need this status on demand, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications] for status information instead, as the previous section describes.\n\n### Retry attempts that fail\n\nThe App Store server sends real-time notifications as it processes your request to [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-Subscription-Renewal-Dates-for-All-Active-Subscribers]. The notifications inform you each time an attempt to extend the renewal date succeeds or fails. You can retry the failed attempts by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-a-Subscription-Renewal-Date] endpoint with the failed subscription’s transaction identifier.

Look for notifications with a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/notificationType] of `RENEWAL_EXTENSION` and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/subtype] of `FAILURE`. The notification identifies a specific subscription that failed to receive a subscription-renewal-date extension.\n3. Find the subscription’s transaction identifier in the notification’s payload, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responseBodyV2DecodedPayload]. Specifically, use the `originalTransactionId` in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/JWSTransactionDecodedPayload], which you get from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/JWSTransaction] of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/data] object in the payload.\n4. Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-a-Subscription-Renewal-Date] using the `originalTransactionID`.\n\n## Subscription-renewal-date extension\n\n- **Extend a Subscription Renewal Date**: Extends the renewal date of a customer’s active subscription using the original transaction identifier.\n- **Extend Subscription Renewal Dates for All Active Subscribers**: Uses a subscription’s product identifier to extend the renewal date for all of its eligible active subscribers.\n- **Get Status of Subscription Renewal Date Extensions**: Checks whether a renewal date extension request completed, and provides the final count of successful or failed extensions.\n- **ExtendRenewalDateRequest**: The request body that contains subscription-renewal-extension data for an individual subscription.\n- **ExtendRenewalDateResponse**: A response that indicates whether an individual renewal-date extension succeeded, and related details.\n- **MassExtendRenewalDateRequest**: The request body that contains subscription-renewal-extension data to apply for all eligible active subscribers.\n- **MassExtendRenewalDateResponse**: A response that indicates the server successfully received the subscription-renewal-date extension request.\n- **MassExtendRenewalDateStatusResponse**: A response that indicates the current status of a request to extend the subscription renewal date to all eligible subscribers.\n\n",
