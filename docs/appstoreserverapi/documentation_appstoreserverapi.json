The App Store signs the transaction and subscription renewal information that this API returns using the [https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/html\/rfc7515] specification.

The App Store server returns information based on a customer’s In-App Purchase history regardless of whether the customer installs, removes, or reinstalls the app on their devices.\n\nThis API provides the following functionality:\n\n- **Transactions and auto-renewable subscription status.** Get information for single transactions by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Transaction-Info] or a customer’s entire transaction history using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Transaction-History]. Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-All-Subscription-Statuses] for up-to-date subscription status. Use this information to keep your customers’ purchase information current on your server.\n- **Refund information.** Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Refund-History] to get a customer’s refund history. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Send-Consumption-Information] endpoint to send information to the App Store when customers request a refund for a consumable In-App Purchase, after you receive the `CONSUMPTION_REQUEST` [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/notificationType] from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/App-Store-Server-Notifications-V2]. Your data helps inform refund decisions.\n- **App Store Server Notifications history and testing.** Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Notification-History] to request the notifications your server may have missed in the past 180 days (or 30 days in the sandbox environment). Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Request-a-Test-Notification] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Test-Notification-Status] to test if your server is successfully receiving notifications at its [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/App-Store-Server-Notifications-V2] endpoint.\n- **Subscription renewal date extensions.** Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Extend-a-Subscription-Renewal-Date] and related endpoints to compensate your customers for temporary service outages, canceled events, or interruptions to live-streamed events by extending the renewal date of their paid, active subscription. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/extending-the-renewal-date-for-auto-renewable-subscriptions].\n- **Order information lookup.** Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Look-Up-Order-ID] to get In-App Purchase information based on a customer’s order ID, found on the App Store receipt that customers receive in email.\n- **App transaction information and setting an app account token.** Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-App-Transaction-Info] to get details about the customer’s purchase of your app, such as the original purchase date and version. Use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Set-App-Account-Token] to set an app account token when your customer makes an In-App Purchase outside your app, or to update its value.\n\nYour server must support the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol 1.2 or later to use the App Store Server API.\n\nCheck the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/app-store-server-api-changelog] to learn about the latest changes to this API.

Access the sandbox environment by sending requests to the endpoints using the following base URL:\n\n```other\nhttps:\/\/api.storekit-sandbox.itunes.apple.com\/\n```\n\nFor example, to call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Transaction-History] in the sandbox environment, send a request using the sandbox URL:\n\n```other\nhttps:\/\/api.storekit-sandbox.itunes.apple.com\/inApps\/v2\/history\/{transactionId}\n```\n\nNote that `\/inApps` in the path is case-sensitive.\n\nFor endpoints that take a [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/transactionId] as a parameter, be sure to call the endpoint using the same environment that creates the transaction identifier. Environment information is present in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/environment] property of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/JWSTransactionDecodedPayload].\n\nIf you don’t have environment information, follow these steps:\n\n1. Call the endpoint using the production URL. If the call succeeds, the transaction identifier belongs to the production environment.\n2. If you receive an error code `4040010` [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreserverapi\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/TransactionIdNotFoundError], call the endpoint using the sandbox environment.\n3. If the call succeeds, the transaction identifier belongs to the sandbox environment. If the call fails with the `4040010` error code, the transaction identifier isn’t present in either environment.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Simplifying your implementation by using the App Store Server
