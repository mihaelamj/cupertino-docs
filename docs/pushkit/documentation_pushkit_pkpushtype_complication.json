The watchOS app’s complication must be active on the user’s current clock face. If it is not, the system does not deliver pushes of this type. For watchOS 6 and later, send the push notification directly to Apple Watch. For watchOS 5 and earlier, you must send it to the iOS companion instead.\n\nThe time your watchOS app spends processing these push notifications counts against the budget allotted to your complication for updating itself. Don’t start any long-running tasks when processing the notification payload. In fact, it is recommended that you include all needed data in the payload so that your app can process that data quickly.\n\nThe system limits you to 50 push notifications per day. If you exceed the limit, subsequent pushes are not delivered.",
