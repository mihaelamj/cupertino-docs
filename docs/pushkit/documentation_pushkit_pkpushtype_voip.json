Apps receiving VoIP push notifications must report the call quickly to CallKit, so it can alert the user to the presence of the incoming call. For apps linked against the iOS 13 SDK or later, the system terminates your app if you fail to report these notifications to CallKit. If your app repeatedly fails to report VoIP notifications to CallKit, the system stops launching your app for VoIP push notifications.\n\nDon’t use this type of notification for anything other than initiating VoIP calls. If you don’t want to post the CallKit call interface, handle notifications with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications] framework instead of PushKit. When sending encrypted content, use a Notification Service Extension to decrypt that content before displaying it to the user. You can also use a Notification Content Extension to display a custom interface for your app’s notifications.
