Use this method to extract data from the notification’s payload and to perform the relevant task for that data. For example, use this method to update the complication data of your watchOS app. When you finish the task, execute the provided `completion` handler block to let PushKit know you are finished.\n\nWhen linking against the iOS 13 SDK or later, your implementation of this method must report notifications of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.pushkit\/documentation\/PushKit\/PKPushType\/voIP] to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CallKit] framework by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CallKit\/CXProvider\/reportNewIncomingCall(with:update:completion:)] method of your app’s `CXProvider` object. When you call that method, the system displays the standard incoming call interface to the user unless an error occurs. For example, the system reports an error if the user enabled Do Not Disturb. You may establish a connection to your VoIP server in tandem with notify CallKit.",
