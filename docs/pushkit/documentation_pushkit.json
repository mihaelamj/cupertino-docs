  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe PushKit framework supports specialized notifications for updating your watchOS complications, responding to file provider changes, and receiving incoming Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls. PushKit notifications differ from the ones you handle with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications] framework. Instead of displaying an alert, badging your app’s icon, or playing a sound, PushKit notifications wake up or launch your app and give it time to respond. Both PushKit and User Notifications use the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to deliver push notifications to user devices.\n\nTo receive PushKit notifications, your app creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.pushkit\/documentation\/PushKit\/PKPushRegistry] object and uses it to configure the notification types it supports. When registration is successful, PushKit delivers a unique data token to your app that contains the identity of the current device and the push type. Forward that token along to the server, and include it in any notifications you send to the user. APNs uses the token to deliver the correct type of notification to the user’s device.\n\nFor information about how to configure your server to work with APNs, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/setting-up-a-remote-notification-server].",
