A parent or guardian must authenticate a child’s account, while individuals can authenticate their own account. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.FamilyControls\/documentation\/FamilyControls\/FamilyControlsMember].\n\nCall this method when your app first launches.\n\nIf the [doc:\/\/com.apple.FamilyControls\/documentation\/FamilyControls\/FamilyControlsMember\/individual] hasn’t authorized your app previously, the device tries to authorize that individual using Face ID or Touch ID. After the user approves or cancels the request, the system either sets the authorization status or throws an error.\n\nAfter a [doc:\/\/com.apple.FamilyControls\/documentation\/FamilyControls\/FamilyControlsMember\/individual] authorizes your app, additional calls to `requestAuthorization(for:)` no longer ask to authorize that `individual` using Face ID or Touch ID. Additionally, the system removes any restrictions that prevent the user from bypassing parental controls so the user can delete an authorized app or sign out of iCloud as needed.\n\nYou can revoke authorization by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.FamilyControls\/documentation\/FamilyControls\/AuthorizationCenter\/revokeAuthorization(completionHandler:)].",
