You can authorize parental controls on any device.\n\n\n\nAuthorizing parental controls for a child requires approval from a parent or guardian in the same Family Sharing group. The system displays an authentication sheet on the child’s device, and the parent or guardian approves or denies the authorization request. The system sends the result to your app’s `AuthorizationCenter`.\n\nAuthorizing parental controls for an individual requires approval from the owner of the device. The system displays a biometric authentication alert on the individual’s device after the individual approves or denies the authorization request. The system sends the result to your app’s `AuthorizationCenter`.\n\nThe Family Controls framework prevents child users, authorized by a parent or guardian, from performing actions that might circumvent the parental controls settings. For example, authorizing an app prevents the child user from deleting the app that provides parental controls. In addition, while a device has at least one app authorized for parental controls by a parent or guardian, the user can’t sign out of iCloud.\n\nIn a compatible iPad or iPhone app running in visionOS, authorization attempts always fail.",
