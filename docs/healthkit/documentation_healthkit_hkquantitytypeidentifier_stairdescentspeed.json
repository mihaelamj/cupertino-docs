  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis is a measurement of how fast the user walks down stairs. The system automatically records stair descent samples on Apple Watch Series 5 or later. The user must walk down a 10-foot (3-meter) flight of steps while wearing the watch. The system records 20 samples on a typical day; however, some days may go over 100 samples, for example if the user goes on a long hike. The watch doesn’t record stair descent speed samples if the user’s wheelchair status is on.\n\nThese samples use distance\/time units (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit]) and measure discrete values (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityAggregationStyle]). For example, the following code shows two ways to create a meters\/second unit. The first uses explicit constructors, while the second initializes the unit from a string.\n\nThe sample’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantitySample\/quantity] property represents the average descent speed between the sample’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSample\/startDate] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSample\/endDate] properties.",
