By default, the watch uses the accelerometer to estimate the intensity of the user’s movement. However, during workout sessions, the watch uses additional sensors, like the heart rate sensor and GPS, to generate estimates.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkoutSession] sessions also contribute to the exercise time.  For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkout#Fill-the-Activity-rings].\n\nThese samples use time units (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit]) and measure cumulative values (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityAggregationStyle]).",
