  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nWalking asymmetry is the percent of time that a user’s steps with one foot are faster or slower than the other foot. The system automatically records walking asymmetry samples on iPhone 8 or later. The user must carry their phone near their waist—such as in a pocket—and walk steadily on flat ground. The system records the phone’s location using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKMetadataKeyDevicePlacementSide] metadata key. The system records 10 to 30 walking asymmetry samples on a typical day. iPhone doesn’t record walking asymmetry samples if the user’s wheelchair status is on.\n\nThese samples use percentage units (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit]) and measure discrete values (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityAggregationStyle]). For example, the following code creates a percentage unit.\n\nThe sample’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantitySample\/quantity] property represents the percent of asymmetrical steps between the sample’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSample\/startDate] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSample\/endDate] properties.",
