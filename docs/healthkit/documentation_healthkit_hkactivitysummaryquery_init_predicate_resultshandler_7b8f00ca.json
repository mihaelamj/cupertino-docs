The queries run on an anonymous background queue. As soon as the query is complete, the results handler block is executed on the same background queue (but not necessarily the same thread). You typically dispatch these results to the main queue to update the user interface.\n\nActivity summary queries can also act as long-running queries. If you assign an update handler before you execute the query, the query continues to monitor the HealthKit store after gathering the initial results. The update handler is called on a background queue every time a matching sample is saved or updated in the HealthKit store. You can cancel this query by calling the store’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKHealthStore\/stop(_:)] method.",
