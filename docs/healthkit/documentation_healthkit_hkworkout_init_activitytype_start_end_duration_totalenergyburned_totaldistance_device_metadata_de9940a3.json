For a complete list of activity types, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkoutActivityType].\n- **startDate**: The date and time when the activity started.\n- **endDate**: The date and time when the activity ended. This date must be equal to or later than the start date.\n- **duration**: A time interval representing the workout’s actual duration. Passing a nonzero value sets the workout’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkout\/duration] property. If you pass 0, this method calculates the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkout\/duration] property based on the workout’s start and end dates.\n- **totalEnergyBurned**: A quantity using energy units, or `nil`. This property sets the workout’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkout\/totalEnergyBurned] property. It represents the total active energy burned during the workout.\n- **totalDistance**: A quantity using length units, or `nil`. This property sets the workout’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkout\/totalDistance] property.\n- **device**: The device that generated the data for this sample.\n- **metadata**: The metadata dictionary contains extra information describing this workout. The dictionary’s keys are all [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString] objects . The values may be [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNumber], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDate] objects. For a complete list of predefined metadata keys, see Metadata Keys.\n\nUsing predefined keys helps facilitate sharing data between apps; however, you are also encouraged to create your own, custom keys as needed to extend the workout’s capabilities.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA workout object with the provided duration, total energy burned, total distance, device, and metadata properties.
