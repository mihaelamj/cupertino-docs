You can also use queries to list all the sources for a particular data type, or to perform statistical calculations for a data type. For example, statistical queries can calculate the minimum and maximum heart rate for a given week, or the total step count for a given day.\n\nYou run a query by calling the HealthKit store’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKHealthStore\/execute(_:)] method.
