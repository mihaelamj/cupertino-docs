Apple Watch estimates the walking heart rate by averaging heart rate samples taken while the user is walking, as well as heart rate samples taken during walking workout sessions.\n\nBecause walking heart rate estimates become more accurate as the day progresses, the system may delete earlier samples and replace them with better estimates. Apple Watch replaces only the samples written by the watch for the current or previous day.",
