For example, if you’re using a day interval, you might create a date object with a time of 2:00 a.m. This value sets the start of the day for each of your time intervals.\n\nTechnically, the anchor sets the start time for a single time interval. All other time intervals must align with this interval. The time intervals can extend before or after the anchor date. Each time interval has the same length, and there’s no gap between adjacent intervals. Think of time as a number line: The anchor date represents its origin, and the intervals create tick marks that extend away from the origin in both directions.",
