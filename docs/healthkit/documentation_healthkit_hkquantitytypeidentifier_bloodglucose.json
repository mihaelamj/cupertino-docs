The Health app uses these units for both the display and manual entry of blood glucose samples.\n- You can access the preferred units using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKHealthStore\/preferredUnits(for:completion:)] method. If your app connects to a glucose meter that uses units other than the preferred units, alert the user. You can also recommend that users change their preferred units to match the glucose meter.\n- Don’t save samples to HealthKit when the blood glucose meter is processing control solution.\n\n## Metadata Keys\n\n- **HKMetadataKeyBloodGlucoseMealTime**: A key that indicates the relative timing of a blood glucose reading to a meal.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **HKQuantityTypeIdentifier**: The identifiers that create quantity type objects.\n- **HKQuantitySample**: A sample that represents a quantity, including the value and the units.\n- **HKQuantity**: An object that stores a value for a given unit.\n\n## Lab and test results\n\n- **bloodAlcoholContent**: A quantity sample type that measures the user’s blood alcohol content.\n- **electrodermalActivity**: A quantity sample type that measures electrodermal activity.\n- **forcedExpiratoryVolume1**: A quantity sample type that measures the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs during the first second of a forced exhalation.\n- **forcedVitalCapacity**: A quantity sample type that measures the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible.\n- **inhalerUsage**: A quantity sample type that measures the number of puffs the user takes from their inhaler.\n- **insulinDelivery**: A quantity sample that measures the amount of insulin delivered.\n- **numberOfTimesFallen**: A quantity sample type that measures the number of times the user fell.\n- **peakExpiratoryFlowRate**: A quantity sample type that measures the user’s maximum flow rate generated during a forceful exhalation.\n- **peripheralPerfusionIndex**: A quantity sample type that measures the user’s peripheral perfusion index.\n\n",
