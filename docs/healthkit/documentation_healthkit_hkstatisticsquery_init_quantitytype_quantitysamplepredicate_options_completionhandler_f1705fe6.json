This type must be an instance of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityType] class. You cannot perform statistics queries using other sample types.\n- **quantitySamplePredicate**: A predicate that limits the results returned by the query. You can pass `nil` if you want to perform the statistical calculation over all the samples of the specified type.\n- **options**: A list of options that define the type of statistical calculations performed and the way in which data from multiple sources are merged. For a list of valid options, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKStatisticsOptions].\n- **handler**: A block that is called after the statistical calculations are complete. This block takes the following arguments:\n\n\n\n## Return Value\n\nA newly initialized statistics query object.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAfter instantiating the query, call the `HKHealthStore` class’s `executeQuery:` method to run this query.
