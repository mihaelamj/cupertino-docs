Open the sample with the latest version of Xcode.\n2. Select the top-level project.\n3. For the three targets, select the correct team in the Signing & Capabilities pane (next to Team) to let Xcode automatically manage your provisioning profile.\n4. Make a note of the Bundle Identifier of the WatchKit App target.\n5. Open the `Info.plist` file of the WatchKit Extension target, and change the value of the `NSExtension` > `NSExtensionAttributes` > `WKAppBundleIdentifier` key to the bundle ID you noted in the previous step.\n6. Make a clean build and run the sample app on your device.\n\n## Sessions\n\n- **Running workout sessions**: Track a workout on Apple Watch.\n- **Building a multidevice workout app**: Mirror a workout from a watchOS app to its companion iOS app, and perform bidirectional communication between them.\n- **Building a workout app for iPhone and iPad**: Start a workout in iOS, control it from the Lock Screen with App Intents, and present the workout status with Live Activities.\n- **HKWorkoutSession**: A session that tracks a person’s workout.\n- **HKWorkoutConfiguration**: An object that contains configuration information about a workout session.\n- **HKWorkoutSessionState**: A workout session’s state.\n- **HKLiveWorkoutBuilder**: A builder object that constructs a workout incrementally based on live data from an active workout session.\n- **HKLiveWorkoutDataSource**: A data source that automatically provides live data from an active workout session.\n\n",
