If your app has been denied permission to share an object’s data type, it fails with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKError\/Code\/errorAuthorizationDenied] error. Deleting objects that are not stored in the HealthKit store fails with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKError\/Code\/errorInvalidArgument] error.

However, the deleted objects are periodically removed to save storage space.
