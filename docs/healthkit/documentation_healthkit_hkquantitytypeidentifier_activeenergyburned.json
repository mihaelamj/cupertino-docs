These samples should not include the resting energy burned during the sample’s duration. Use the health store’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKHealthStore\/splitTotalEnergy(_:start:end:resultsHandler:)] method to split a workout’s total energy burned into the active and resting portions, and then save each portion in its own sample. The system automatically records active energy samples on Apple Watch.\n\nActive energy samples use energy units (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit]) and measure cumulative values (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityAggregationStyle]).
