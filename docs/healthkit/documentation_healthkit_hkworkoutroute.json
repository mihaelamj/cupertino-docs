Instead, create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkoutRouteBuilder] object, and provide it with location data throughout the workout. After the workout ends, call the route builder’s  [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkoutRouteBuilder\/finishRoute(with:metadata:completion:)] method to create the route. For detailed instructions, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/creating-a-workout-route].\n\nThe route’s location data is stored as an array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocation] objects. Because the route may contain a large number of location objects, use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkoutRouteQuery] object to asynchronously read the location data from the HealthKit store in batches.
