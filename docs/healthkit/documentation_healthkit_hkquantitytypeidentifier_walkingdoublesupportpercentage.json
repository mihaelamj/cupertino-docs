  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThese samples measure the percentage of time during a walk that both of the user’s feet are on the ground. A lower value indicates that the user spends more time with the weight on just one foot instead of two. During a typical walk, this measure falls between 20% and 40%. Double support time varies depending on how fast the user walks and the terrain.\n\nThe system automatically records double support samples on iPhone 8 or later. The user must carry their phone near their waist—such as in a pocket—and walk steadily on flat ground. The system records 10 to 30 walking double support samples on a typical day. iPhone doesn’t record double support samples if the user’s wheelchair status is on.\n\nThese samples use percentage units (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit]) and measure discrete values (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityAggregationStyle]). For example, the following code creates a percentage unit.\n\nThe sample’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantitySample\/quantity] property represents the percent of time the user had weight on both feet between the sample’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSample\/startDate] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSample\/endDate] properties.",
