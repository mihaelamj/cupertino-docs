  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nWalking speed represents how quickly the user walks on flat ground. The system automatically records walking speed samples on iPhone 8 or later. The user must carry their phone near their waist—such as in a pocket—and walk steadily on flat ground. To ensure accuracy, the user’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityTypeIdentifier\/height] value must be up to date. The system records 10 to 30 walking speed samples on a typical day. iPhone doesn’t record walking speed samples if the user’s wheelchair status is on.\n\nThese samples use distance per time units (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit]) and measure discrete values (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityAggregationStyle]).  For example, the following code shows two ways to create a meters per second unit. The first uses explicit constructors, while the second initializes the unit from a string.\n\nThe sample’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantitySample\/quantity] property represents the average walking speed between the sample’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSample\/startDate] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSample\/endDate] properties.",
