Specifically, the following guidelines apply to all HealthKit apps:\n\n- Your app may not use information gained through the use of the HealthKit framework for advertising or similar services. Note that you may still serve advertising in an app that uses the HealthKit framework, but you can’t use data from the HealthKit store to serve ads.\n- You must not disclose any information gained through HealthKit to a third party without express permission from the user. Even with permission, you can only share information to a third party if they also provide a health or fitness service to the user.\n- You can’t sell information gained through HealthKit to advertising platforms, data brokers, or information resellers.\n- If the user consents, you may share their HealthKit data with a third party for medical research.\n- You must clearly disclose to the user how you and your app will use their HealthKit data.\n\n### Provide a privacy policy\n\nYou must also provide a privacy policy for any app that uses the HealthKit framework. You can find guidance on creating a privacy policy at the following sites:\n\n- Personal Health Record model (for non-HIPAA apps): [http:\/\/www.healthit.gov\/policy-researchers-implementers\/personal-health-record-phr-model-privacy-notice]\n- HIPAA model (for HIPAA covered apps): [https:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/hipaa\/for-professionals\/privacy\/guidance\/model-notices-privacy-practices\/index.html]\n\nThese models, developed by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), are designed to improve user experience and comprehension with plain language and approachable designs that explain how your app collects and shares user data.
