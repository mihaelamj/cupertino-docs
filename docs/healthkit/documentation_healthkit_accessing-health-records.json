  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse HealthKit’s clinical record support to read Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) from the HealthKit store. Users can download their FHIR records from supported healthcare institutions. The system then updates the records in the background on a regular basis.\n\nInstead of focusing on documents, FHIR breaks the user’s medical history into discrete records. HealthKit then represents each FHIR record as an [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalRecord] sample that stores a single condition, procedure, or result.\n\nTo use clinical records, you must request permission to read each record type. Then, use HealthKit’s queries to access the individual records. Finally, you need to parse and handle each record’s FHIR JSON data.\n\nXcode’s simulator provides sample accounts you can use when building and testing your app. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/accessing-sample-data-in-the-simulator].\n\n### Set Up HealthKit\n\nDue to their sensitive nature, clinical records have additional setup requirements. First, when you enable your app’s HealthKit capabilities, you must also select the Clinical Health Records checkbox.\n\n\n\nNext, you must provide a Health Records Usage string for your app. Use this string to describe what your app does with the user’s records, and why it’s important for the user to share this data.\n\nFor projects created using Xcode 13 or later, set the usage key in the Target Properties list on the app’s Info tab. For projects created with Xcode 12 or earlier, set it in the apps `Info.plist` file. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List].\n\n\n\nYou request authorization to read clinical records using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalTypeIdentifier] enumeration. This enumeration specifies the types of FHIR data supported by HealthKit. You must request permission to read all the types that your app intends to use. Additionally, clinical records are read-only, so you can’t request authorization to share clinical record types. You can’t create or save new [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalRecord] objects.\n\nYou can request authorization of clinical record types and regular HealthKit types in the same method call; however, HealthKit presents the clinical record types in a separate permission sheet to ensure the user understands exactly what they’re approving.\n\nApp Review may reject apps that don’t use clinical record data appropriately. For more information, see the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/review\/guidelines\/#health-and-health-research] section of the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/review\/guidelines\/].\n\n### Query for Health Records\n\nYou can use HealthKit’s regular queries to look up clinical records.\n\nEach query returns a single clinical record type. HealthKit also provides two predicates to further refine your queries:\n\n### Examine FHIR Data\n\nOnce you have an [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalRecord] sample, you can access the FHIR data through its [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalRecord\/fhirResource] property. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResource] object represents the underlying data from the user’s health care institution. While the resource object provides properties to access a few, useful attributes ([doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResource\/identifier], [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResource\/resourceType], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResource\/sourceURL]), use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResource\/data] property to access the underlying JSON, which contains the complete clinical data.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResource] object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResource\/resourceType] property contains a [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResourceType] value. While the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResourceType] enumeration is similar to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalTypeIdentifier] values, there isn’t a one-to-one relationship between them.\n\nFor example, HealthKit splits the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResourceType\/observation] type into the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalTypeIdentifier\/labResultRecord] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalTypeIdentifier\/vitalSignRecord] identifiers. As a result, you must query for lab results and vital signs separately.\n\nSimilarly, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalTypeIdentifier\/medicationRecord] identifier matches [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResourceType\/medicationStatement], [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResourceType\/medicationOrder], [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResourceType\/medicationRequest], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKFHIRResourceType\/medicationDispense] types. Therefore—unless you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuery\/predicateForClinicalRecords(withFHIRResourceType:)] predicate—when you query for medication, you can get a mixture of statement, order, request, and dispense records.\n\nThe following sample shows JSON data for an FHIR Condition resource:\n\nJuan Chavez recorded this resource in 2012. It describes seasonal allergic rhinitis (SNOMED code 367498001), with an onset date of May 12, 1994.\n\nThe FHIR data contains a considerable amount of additional information; however, to access this data you need to understand the FHIR specification.\n\nFor more information, see the following websites:",
