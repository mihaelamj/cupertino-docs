The range is -10.5 to +6.5.\n- **cylinder**: Part of the correction for astigmatism. This property measures the strength of the correction in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit\/diopter()] units. The range is -3.0 to 3.0.\n- **axis**: Part of the correction for astigmatism. This property measures the orientation of the correction in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit\/degreeAngle()] units.\n- **addPower**: The correction for nearsightedness, measured in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit\/diopter()] units. The range is from 0.25 to 2.5. The right and left eyes should have the same value.\n- **vertexDistance**: The distance between the back of the lens and the eye, measured in mm. The range is 12 to 14 mm.\n- **prism**: An object that contains information about the correction for eye alignment. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKVisionPrism].\n- **farPupillaryDistance**: The distance between the pupil and the center of the nose when looking at an object far away, measured in mm.\n- **nearPupillaryDistance**: The distance between the pupil and the center of the nose when looking at a nearby object, measured in mm.\n\n",
