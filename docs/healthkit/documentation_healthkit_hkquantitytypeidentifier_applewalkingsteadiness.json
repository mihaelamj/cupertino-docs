For example, the following code creates a percentage unit.\n\nThe value can be between `0.0` and `1.0`.\n\nThe system automatically records Walking Steadiness samples on iPhone 8 or later. The user must carry their phone near their waist—such as in a pocket—and walk steadily on flat ground. To ensure accuracy, the user must set their [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityTypeIdentifier\/height] value in the Health app. The system creates a Walking Steadiness sample every 7 days—though the interval can be longer if it doesn’t have enough mobility data to calculate accurate results. iPhone doesn’t record Walking Steadiness samples if the user’s wheelchair status is on.\n\nWalking Steadiness samples are read-only.
