  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis sample demonstrates how to request access to a user’s clinical records through [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/HealthKit]. With the HealthKit framework’s clinical record support, you can read [http:\/\/hl7.org\/fhir] (FHIR) objects from the HealthKit store. People must first download their clinical records from one of the [https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT208647] before the records appear in HealthKit.\n\n### Configure the Sample Code Project\n\nTo use HealthKit, you must first enable the HealthKit capability and include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSHealthShareUsageDescription] key in your app’s `Info.plist` file, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/HealthKit\/accessing-health-records]. To access the clinical records, check the Clinical Health Records checkbox in the HealthKit capability and include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSHealthClinicalHealthRecordsShareUsageDescription] key in your app’s `Info.plist` file.\n\nThe sample app enables the capability and provides the usage string.\n\nBefore building and running the app:\n\nWhen you first run the app, it hasn’t requested permission to read or share any data in HealthKit. Tapping any items in the list results in an Authorization not Determined error. To authorize the app, scroll to the bottom of the list, and tap the Authorize button.\n\n### Define the Sample Types to Request\n\nThe app defines the clinical record sample types using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKClinicalTypeIdentifier] enumeration. The app must request permission to read all the types that it intends to use. Note that the app may define both clinical records and standard HealthKit sample types at the same time.\n\n### Request Authorization\n\nThe app may request authorization to access both clinical data and HealthKit data simultaneously.\n\nTypically, apps that read or share HealthKit data automatically request authorization–either when the app first launches or just before the app needs to access the data. However, to provide readers with complete control over the authorization process, this sample code doesn’t automatically request authorization. Instead, anyone using the app must manually request authorization, by scrolling to the bottom of the list and tapping the Authorize button.\n\n### Query for Health Records\n\nTo query for clinical records, the app uses an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKSampleQuery] as shown below.\n\n### Access Elements Within a FHIR Resource\n\nAfter a person using the app has given the app access to their clinical records, the app needs to extract the relevant information from the FHIR JSON data so that it can do something useful with it. For example, to display the status of a medication in the form of a [http:\/\/hl7.org\/fhir\/DSTU2\/medicationstatement] resource, the app needs to access the `MedicationStatement.status` element.\n\nThe app uses the [https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/FHIRModels] library to parse the JSON data into Swift classes. For more details on FHIRModels, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2020\/10669].\n\nIt uses a `JSONDecoder` to convert the resource’s JSON data:\n\nThis provides direct access to the `status` element, so that the app can display it. It appears as the subtitle of the Medication list view.",
