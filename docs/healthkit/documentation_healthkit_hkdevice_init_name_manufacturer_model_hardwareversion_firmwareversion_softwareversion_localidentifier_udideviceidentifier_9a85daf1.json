When used in a predicate, HealthKit finds all devices that match the non-`nil` parameters. This gives you a great deal of control when it comes to fine-tuning your search. For example, setting the `localIdentifier` and the `firmwareVersion` parameters lets you query for all the samples generated by a specific device running a specific version of the firmware. Just setting the `manufacturer` and `model` casts a much broader net. For more information on querying for device-specific samples, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKPredicateKeyPathDevice].\n\nWhen creating devices for new samples, it is best to provide values for as many parameters as you can. Even if you aren’t interest in a particular parameter, other apps may use it in their queries. More importantly, your app may need to use it in the future.",

Each health and fitness peripheral should have a separate local identifier for each iOS device it connects to. For example, a heart-rate monitor would have a different identifier when connected to Apple Watch than when connected to iPhone.\n- **UDIDeviceIdentifier**: If the device object represents a medical device, use the device identifier portion of the Food and Drug Administration Unique Device Identifier (UDI). If the device does not have a UDI, pass `nil`.\n\n\n\n## Return Value\n\nA newly initialized device object that encapsulates the provided data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to create a device object representing an arbitrary piece of hardware.
