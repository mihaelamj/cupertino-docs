  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nOn watchOS 9 and iOS 16 and later, once a person enables AFib History, Apple Watch begins collecting heart-rhythm data more frequently. iPhone then calculates the AFib burden once a week, as long as Apple Watch has gathered enough heart-rhythm data during that week.\n\nIf iPhone is unlocked and isn’t under heavy load, it starts analyzing heart rhythm samples around 8:00 am Monday morning. As soon as it finishes this analysis, iPhone sends the user a notification telling them the results.\n\nThese samples use percentage units (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKUnit]) and measure discrete values (described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuantityAggregationStyle]). The sample’s value represents an estimate of the percentage of time a person’s heart shows signs of AFib while wearing Apple Watch.",
