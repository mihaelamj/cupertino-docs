The [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuery] class is an abstract class. You should never instantiate it directly. Instead, you always work with one of its concrete subclasses.\n\n### Filter queries using predicates\n\nAll the concrete `HKQuery` subclasses take a predicate. You can use this predicate to filter the samples returned by the query. When HealthKit runs a query, it converts the predicate to SQL and executes the SQL on the underlying store. This has two important side effects.\n\n- Predicates improve the performance of your query, both in terms of speed and memory usage. Because the store executes the predicate, it restricts the number of HealthKit objects that it instantiates and returns.\n- Since the store executes these predicates, it limits the type of predicates that you can use. Specifically, HealthKit provides several predicate key paths (for example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKPredicateKeyPathUUID] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKPredicateKeyPathMetadata]). You can create predicates using only these key paths.\n\n## Accessing properties\n\n- **predicate**: A predicate used to filter the objects returned from the HealthKit store.\n- **objectType**: The
