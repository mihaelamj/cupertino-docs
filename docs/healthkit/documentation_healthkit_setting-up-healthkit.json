For more information on requesting authorization, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/authorizing-access-to-health-data]. For a practical example of how to set up and use HealthKit, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/build-a-workout-app-for-apple-watch].\n\n### Enable HealthKit\n\nBefore you can use HealthKit, you must enable the HealthKit capabilities for your app. In Xcode, select the project and add the HealthKit capability. Only select the Clinical Health Records checkbox if your app needs to access the user’s clinical records. App Review may reject apps that enable the Clinical Health Records capability if the app doesn’t actually use the health record data. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/accessing-health-records].\n\n\n\nFor a detailed discussion about enabling capabilities, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/configuring-healthkit-access].\n\nWhen you enable the HealthKit capabilities on an iOS app, Xcode adds HealthKit to the list of required device capabilities, which prevents users from purchasing or installing the app on devices that don’t support HealthKit.\n\nIf HealthKit isn’t required for the correct operation of your app, delete the `healthkit` entry from the “Required device capabilities” array. Delete this entry from either the Target Properties list on the app’s Info tab or from the app’s `Info.plist` file.\n\nFor more information on required device capabilities, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities].\n\n### Ensure HealthKit’s availability\n\nCall the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKHealthStore\/isHealthDataAvailable()] method to confirm that HealthKit is available on the user’s device.\n\nCall this method before calling any other HealthKit methods. If HealthKit isn’t available on the device (for example, on iPadOS 16 or earlier, or macOS), other HealthKit methods fail with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKError\/errorHealthDataUnavailable] error. If HealthKit is restricted (for example, in an enterprise environment), the methods fail with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKError\/errorHealthDataRestricted] error.\n\n### Create the HealthKit store\n\nIf HealthKit is both enabled and available, instantiate an [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKHealthStore] object for your app as shown:\n\nYou need only a single HealthKit store per app. These are long-lived objects; you create the store once, and keep a reference for later use.",
