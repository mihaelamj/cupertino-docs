Your app can send data from either the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkoutSessionType\/mirrored] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkoutSessionType\/primary] workout session.\n\nIn iOS, your app can go into the background and become suspended. When suspended, HealthKit gathers the data coming from the remote session. When the app resumes, HealthKit sends an array containing all the  data objects it has accumulated to this delegate method. The data objects in the array appear in the order that the local system received them. During the workout session, HealthKit wakes the iOS app periodically to deliver any cached data objects, but there might be several minutes between delegate calls.\n\nOn watchOS, the workout session keeps the app running even if it’s in the background; however, the system can temporarily suspend the app — for example, if the app uses an excessive amount of CPU in the background. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/running-workout-sessions]. While suspended, HealthKit caches the incoming data objects and delivers an array of data objects when the app resumes, just like in the iOS app.",
