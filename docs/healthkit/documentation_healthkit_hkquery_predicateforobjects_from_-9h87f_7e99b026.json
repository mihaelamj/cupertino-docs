HealthKit returns all the devices that match the non-`nil` parameters. This gives you a great deal of control when it comes to fine tuning your query. For example, setting the `localIdentifier` and the `firmwareVersion` parameters lets you query for all the samples generated by a specific device running a specific version of the firmware. Just setting the `manufacturer` and `model` casts a much broader net.\n\nThe following sample uses both the convenience method and a predicate format string to create equivalent predicates.",
