You must save the workout to the HealthKit store before you can add any samples to it. You can save the samples before calling this method, but doing so is not required. This method automatically saves any unsaved samples when it successfully adds them to the workout.\n\nTo query for all the samples associated with a workout, add the workout to the query’s predicate. For example, the query’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKQuery\/predicateForObjects(from:)-5irg9] method creates a predicate object that matches only samples associated with the provided workout.\n\nFor more information on workouts and associated samples, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkout].",
