  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe date used to anchor the collection’s time intervals.\n\nUse the anchor date to set the start time for your time intervals. For example, if you are using a day interval, you might create a date object with a time of 2:00 a.m. This value sets the start of each day for all of your time intervals.\n\nTechnically, the anchor sets the start time for a single time interval. All other time intervals must align with this interval. The time intervals can extend before or after the anchor date. Each time interval has the same length, and there is no gap between adjacent intervals.  Think of time as a number line: The anchor date represents its origin, with the intervals creating tick marks that extend away from the origin in both directions.",
