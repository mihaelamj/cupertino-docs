For these samples, both the start and the end date are the same, because they both refer to the point in time when the sample was taken.\n\nOther samples—for example, step count—represent data over a time interval. Here, the sample should use different start and end dates. These dates mark the beginning and end of the sample’s time interval, respectively.",
