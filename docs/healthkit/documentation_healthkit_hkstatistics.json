  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nHealthKit creates statistic objects using either a statistics query or a statistics collection query. For the statistics query, it performs the specified calculations over all the samples that match the query. For the statistics collection query, it partitions the matching samples into a set of time intervals and performs the calculations over each interval separately.\n\nBy default, these queries automatically merge the data from all of your data sources before performing the calculations. If you want to merge the data yourself, you can set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKStatisticsOptions\/separateBySource] option. You can then request the statistical data for each source separately.\n\nWhen requesting data from a statistics object, your request must match the options you used when creating the query. For example, if you create a query using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKStatisticsOptions\/discreteAverage] option, you must access the results using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKStatistics\/averageQuantity()] method.\n\nFor more information on calculating statistical data, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.healthkit\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKStatisticsQuery] Class Reference.
