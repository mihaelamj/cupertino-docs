This value is purely for the driver’s use; the host doesn’t look at this value.\n- **in_change_info**: A pointer to an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DriverKit\/OSObject] containing information about the configuration change. The invocation of [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiodriverkit\/documentation\/AudioDriverKit\/IOUserAudioClockDevice\/PerformDeviceConfigurationChange] passes this same info back to your driver.
