  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis sample shows how to transfer data between two iOS devices, with one acting as a Bluetooth central and the other as a peripheral, by using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBCharacteristic] on the peripheral side that changes its value. The value change is automatically picked up on the central side. The sample also shows how the central side can write data to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBCharacteristic] on the peripheral side.\n\nThis sample shows how to handle flow control in this scenario. It also covers a rudimentary way to use the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value to determine whether data transfer is feasible.\n\n### Configure the Sample Code Project\n\n### Discover Bluetooth Peripherals and Connect to Them\n\nThe device running in central mode creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBCentralManager], assigning the `CentralViewController` as the manager’s delegate. It calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBCentralManager\/scanForPeripherals(withServices:options:)] to discover other Bluetooth devices, passing in the UUID of the service it’s searching for.\n\nWhen the central manager discovers a peripheral with a matching service UUID, it calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBCentralManagerDelegate\/centralManager(_:didDiscover:advertisementData:rssi:)]. The sample’s implementation of this method uses the `rssi` (Received Signal Strength Indicator) parameter to determine whether the signal is strong enough to transfer data. RSSI values are provided as negative numbers, with a theortetical maximum of `0`. The sample proceeds with transfer if the `rssi` is greater than or equal to `-50`. If the peripheral’s signal is strong enough, the method saves the peripheral as the property `discoveredPeripheral` and calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBCentralManager\/connect(_:options:)] to connect to it.\n\n### When the Peripheral Receives a Connection, Send the Data\n\nThe device running in peripheral mode creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBPeripheralManager] and assigns its `PeripheralViewController` as the manager’s delegate.\n\nWhen the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBPeripheralManagerDelegate\/peripheralManagerDidUpdateState(_:)] method indicates that Bluetooth has powered on, the sample calls a private `setupPeripheral()` method to create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBMutableCharacteristic] called `transferCharacteristic`. It then creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBMutableService] from the characteristic and adds the service to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBPeripheralManager].\n\nThe user interface provides a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UISwitch] that starts or stops advertising of the peripheral’s service UUID.\n\nOnce the central device discovers and connects to the peripheral, the peripheral side sends the data from the text field to the central. `PeripheralViewController` sends the data in chunks — each sized to the maximum value the central can receive — by setting the value of its `transferCharacteristic` property to the latest chunk. When finished, it sends the value `EOM` (for “end of message”).\n\n### When the Central Receives the Data, Update the User Interface\n\nBack on the central device, a call to the central manager delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBPeripheralDelegate\/peripheral(_:didDiscoverCharacteristicsFor:error:)] tells the app that it has discovered the peripheral’s transfer characteristic. The sample’s implementation of this method calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBPeripheral\/setNotifyValue(_:for:)] to start receiving updates to the characteristic’s value.\n\nWhen the value does update — meaning text is available — the central manager calls the delegate method [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth\/CBPeripheralDelegate\/peripheral(_:didUpdateValueFor:error:)-1xyna]. The sample looks to see if the data is a chunk or an end-of-message marker. If the data is a chunk, the code appends the chunk to an internal buffer containing the peripheral’s message. If the data is an end-of-message marker, it converts the buffer to a string and sets it as the contents of the text field.\n\nOnce the transfer is complete, you can press the “Back” button on each device and reassign the central and peripheral roles, to perform the transfer in the opposite direction.",
