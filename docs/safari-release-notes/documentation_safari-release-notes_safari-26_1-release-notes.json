(159257003)\n- Fixed pseudo-class invalidation performance by creating separate `RuleSets` for attribute selectors like `:has([attr=value])` to avoid using universal invalidation. (159257022)\n- Fixed an issue where changing the `ruby-overhang` property did not trigger a layout update, ensuring proper rendering when overhang values change. (159573050)\n- Fixed anchor positioning to account for a left-hand scrollbar in right-to-left and `vertical-rl` containing blocks. (160723993)\n- Fixed `offsetParent` to return the fixed-position element’s containing block when it is not the viewport, such as a transformed element. (160892685)\n- Fixed handling inline containing blocks for CSS Anchor Positioning. (160892829)\n- Fixed an issue where anchor-positioned elements failed to update their position when the default anchor changed. (160892850)\n- Fixed `<select>` fallback styling by removing the outdated background and updating the dropdown arrow. (161104364)\n- Fixed an issue where transitioning an element to `display: none` with `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` and CSS Anchor Positioning would repeatedly restart the transition. (161421046)\n- Fixed `position-area` for the initial containing block to include the in-flow scrollable area, improving alignment for typical overflow cases. (161997622)\n\n### Forms\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed native text inputs so that their background colors update when autofilled. (159014135)\n- Fixed checkboxes and radio buttons missing borders in the filled state when “Increased Contrast” is enabled on macOS. (159379948)\n\n### PDF\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed VoiceOver not recognizing the password form in encrypted documents.  (159240531)\n\n### Rendering\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a bottom gap appearing on layouts with viewport-sized fixed containers on iOS.

(160060564)\n- Fixed an issue on iOS where Safari extension popups and some websites could scroll or flicker unexpectedly. (160216319)\n- Fixed list markers overlapping text in certain situations.

(160883553)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed absolutely positioned SVGs so that their size correctly accounts for the padding of the containing block when the SVG root is out-of-flow. (160727702)\n\n### Security\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed Safari ignoring the `style-src-elem` Content Security Policy directive ensuring it is checked before falling back to `style-src`, in line with CSP3 specifications. (157298407)\n\n### Web API\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue on iOS 26 where pressing the B button on a gamepad could make a page appear to lose `gamepad` focus by bypassing the system’s automatic navigation behavior. (159125095)\n\n### Web Inspector\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed issue where searching on certain text fails to find matches.  (159897282)\n\n### WebGPU\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue where `GPUQueue.copyExternalImageToTexture` could not handle SVG images. (158442476)\n- Fixed an issue where video playback using the WebGPU renderer in WebCodecs could display a black screen.
