(55121458)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed Voice Control number and name overlays not labeling content inside `iframe` elements. (118252216)\n- Fixed incorrect accessibility bounds of SVG roots, ensuring assistive technologies have access to the correct geometry. (153782363)\n- Fixed an issue where `<label>` elements targeted by `aria-labelledby` stopped providing accessibility text to assistive technologies after dynamic page changes.

(155625287)\n- Added support for endpoint-inclusive active intervals in `Animation.commitStyles()` to correctly persist styles for completed animations. (158684709)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed inheritance of additional animation properties (`animation-timing-function`, `animation-play-state`, `animation-iteration-count`, and `animation-direction`) in `::view-transition` pseudo-elements to improve style consistency. (156131284)\n- Fixed `animation-name` resolution to correctly find matching `@keyframes` within tree-scoped and shadow DOM contexts. (156484228)\n- Fixed a bug where extremely large `animation-duration` values could cause the page to become unresponsive. (158775366)\n- Fixed `Animation.commitStyles()` so that custom properties are properly committed to the target element. (158919736)\n- Fixed `Animation.commitStyles()` to correctly commit logical properties as their corresponding physical properties. (158920529)\n\n### Browser\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Safari now reports a frozen OS version in its user agent string on iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, showing the last version released before iOS 26.  (156170132)\n\n### CSS\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added support for the `cursor` property on pseudo-elements.  (90364915)\n- Added support for improved blur filter rendering using CoreGraphics.

(135907710)\n- Fixed propagation of the `body` element’s `writing-mode` to the document element to match the CSS Writing Modes Level 4 specification. (149475070)\n- Fixed `@position-try` so that `revert-layer` correctly only reverts the position-try origin instead of affecting other cascade origins. (154355428)\n- Fixed positioned boxes in scrollable containing blocks to overflow in scrollable direction. (155625030)\n- Fixed `anchor-center` so that when an anchored element has no anchor in the same containing block, it correctly falls back to behaving like `center` as specified.

(159613287)\n- Fixed an issue where collapsed table rows subtracted `border-spacing` twice. (160542118)\n- Fixed `::view-transition` pseudo-element to use `position: absolute` instead of `fixed` to align with the updated specification. (160622000)\n- Fixed container queries to allow `container-name` matching across the full flat tree, making container names tree-scoped in line with the CSS Conditional 5 specification. (160696378)\n- Fixed handling of `::first-letter` pseudo-elements to always force `inline` display unless floated.(160710650)\n- Fixed the behavior of the nesting selector `&` directly inside `@scope` to correctly act like `:where(:scope)` for proper specificity handling. (160769736)\n- Fixed `position-try-fallback` resolution by treating names as tree-scoped references to properly search shadow DOM host scopes. (161081231)\n- Fixed an issue where a `<select>` element with long `<option>` text caused horizontal scrolling when nested inside a flex item. (161563289)\n- Fixed `getComputedStyle` to return numeric values for `orphans` and `widows` instead of the internal `auto` value, ensuring the computed values correctly reflect the CSS specification. (161566631)\n- Fixed `column-count: 1` so that it now correctly creates a multi-column container per the CSS Multi-column Layout specification. (161611444)\n- Fixed the calculation of anchor positions in `vertical-rl` multi-column layouts by correctly flipping coordinates in fragmented flows. (161616545)\n- Fixed the order to try anchor position fallback options, such that the last successful position option is tried first, followed by the original style, and then the remaining options. (161714637)\n- Fixed `position-area` handling to include the in-flow scrollable area of the initial containing block. (161741583)\n- Fixed `position-visibility: no-overflow` to respond correctly to scrolling. (162173481)\n- Fixed: Renamed `position-area` keywords from `x-self-start`, `x-self-end`, `y-self-start`, and `y-self-end` to `self-x-start`, `self-x-end`, `self-y-start`, and `self-y-end` respectively to align with updated CSSWG specifications.(162214793)\n- Fixed auto margins by converting them to zero when `position-area` or `anchor-center` is applied in CSS Anchor Positioning. (162809291)\n- Fixed `FontFace.family` so that font family names with spaces are treated as plain strings without parsing or serializing aligning with other browsers. (163047573)\n- Fixed flex and grid layout to correctly handle padding and margins in all writing modes. (163048874)\n- Fixed an issue where underlines using `text-underline-position: right` appeared on top of the text in horizontal writing modes instead of under the line. (163506701)\n- Fixed an infinite style resolution loop when a `position-try` box was inside a `display: none` tree. (163691875)\n- Fixed `position-area` alignment so that when only one inset is set to `auto`, the element now aligns toward the opposite non-auto inset. (163691905)\n- Fixed `text-decoration-thickness` and `text-underline-offset` not working in vertical writing modes. (163727749)\n\n### Canvas\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- Removed non-standard legacy `drawImageFromRect`. (141681635)\n\n### DOM\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added `hidden=until-found`.
