(112819599)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed many common issues such as an icon appearing blurry with jagged edges, lacking padding, or failing to load by improving how web app icons are loaded. If you supply multiple size variants for the preferred icon kind, all sizes are saved, allowing the most appropriate size to be displayed based on context. For example, the largest size variant is shown in Finder’s Gallery view and Quick Look, a medium sized variant is shown in the Dock and Launchpad, while a smaller sized variant is shown in Spotlight.\n\nTo provide the best user experience, supply at least one opaque, full-bleed `maskable` square icon in the web app manifest, either as an SVG (any size) or high resolution bitmap (1024x1024). If the web app manifest doesn’t specify any high resolution full-bleed icon, Safari may fall back to the `apple-touch-icon` if it improves the user experience. If you specify an `apple-touch-icon` through `link` elements in the webpage, do not omit these link elements based on user agent detection. When you only supply a transparent icon with custom shape, Safari automatically adjusts spacing between your icon and the standard system background to avoid tangents.  (102449619)\n- Fixed an issue where page zoom is reset to 100% after quit and relaunch.  (110298546) (FB12233006)\n- Fixed a bug where `theme-color` is not applied to the title bar in web apps.  (112980819)\n- Fixed an issue where sign in pages sometimes unexpectely open in Safari instead of the web app.  (113520837)\n- Fixed an issue where clicking on notifications after 30 seconds from delivery fail to open the web app.  (113757950)\n- Fixed an issue that repeatedly asks for camera access after relaunching a web app.  (114110664)\n- Fixed remembering window size for a webpage added to the Dock.  (114534506)\n- Fixed an issue where a blank window remains on screen after starting a download.  (115457207)\n- Fixed an issue where some login pages unexpectedly open in Safari.
