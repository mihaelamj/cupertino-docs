(129131780)\n- Fixed the handling of ElementInternals’s `ariaValueNow` null values so the right value is exposed to assistive technologies.  (129218234)\n- Fixed tables with hidden rows reporting wrong counts and blocking access to some rows in VoiceOver.  (129612387)\n- Fixed `role=\"menu\"` elements to allow child groups with `menuitem` children.  (131838275)\n- Fixed updating the accessibility tree when text underneath an `aria-describedby` element changes.  (131877635)\n- Fixed text exposed to assistive technologies when `display: contents` directly wraps a `display: block` text container.  (132265522)\n- Fixed VoiceOver not finding any content in a table when `display: table` is applied to `tbody` elements.  (132820485)\n\n### Authentication\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue using large credential lists with security keys.  (133711978)\n\n### CSS\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed style container queries querying the root element.  (124875999)\n\n### Editing\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed deleting content immediately before a `<picture>` element unexpectedly removing `<source>` elements.  (128100106)\n- Fixed inserting text before a `<picture>` element inserting the text after the element instead.  (134378236)\n\n### JavaScript\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed incorrect optimization and random non-updated values.  (135851156)\n\n### Media\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a bug in WebCodecs where audio and video codecs with pending work could be prematurely garbage collected.  (134297589)\n\n### Networking\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a bug where `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header fields in the response of iframe elements were not ignored, resulting in `window.opener` being null after multiple cross-origin navigations of the embedder document.  (132840366)\n\n### Rendering\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed `content-visibility` to not apply to elements with `display: contents` or `display: none`.  (134436437)\n- Fixed float clearing in the WordPress Classic Editor sidebar layout.  (136988841)\n\n### Security\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed the `ping` attribute for `<a>` elements to be controlled by the `connect-src` CSP directive.
