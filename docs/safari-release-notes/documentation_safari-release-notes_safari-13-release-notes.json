It’s also available for macOS 10.14.5 and 10.13.6.\n\n### General\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added Desktop-class Browsing to Safari for iPad. Safari for iPad displays the same desktop websites as Safari for macOS, and provides the same capabilities. In addition it has more keyboard shortcuts, a download manager with background downloads, and support for top productivity websites.\n- Added opt-in dark mode support for websites in Safari for iOS.\n- Added support for aborting Fetch requests.\n\n### Authentication and Passwords\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Updated Safari to prompt the user to change weak passwords when signing into a website. Requesting a password change uses the well-known URL for changing passwords, enabling websites to specify the page to open for updating a password.\n- Added support for FIDO2-compliant USB security keys with the Web Authentication standard in Safari on macOS.\n- Added support for Sign in With Apple to Safari and to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView].\n\n### Security and Privacy\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added a permission API on iOS for [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/webkitjs\/devicemotionevent] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/webkitjs\/deviceorientationevent].\n- Changed the behavior for third party iframes to prevent them automatically navigating the page.\n- Updated Intelligent Tracking Prevention to prevent cross-site tracking through referrer and through link decoration.\n- Improved the privacy of local WebRTC data connections with mDNS ICE candidates.\n- Increased the security for WebKit sandboxes on iOS and macOS.\n\n### Layout and Rendering\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added support for one-finger accelerated scrolling to all frames and `overflow:scroll` elements eliminating the need to `set-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`.\n- Changed the default behavior on iPad for wide web pages with responsive meta-tags that require horizontal scrolling. Pages are scaled to prevent horizontal scrolling and any text is resized to preserve legibility.\n- Added support for CSS conic gradients.\n\n### Performance\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Reduced the initial rendering time for webpages on iOS.\n- Added automatic support for Fast Tap to desktop websites on iPad.\n- Reduced load time up to 50% for webpages on watchOS.\n- Reduced the amount of memory used by JavaScript, including for non-web clients.\n- Improved the MotionMark graphics performance benchmark score by 10%.\n\n### Web API\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added support for the `__Secure-` and `__Host-` cookie prefixes in beta 3.\n- Improved iPad hardware keyboard support for websites including focus navigation and scrolling with the arrow keys.\n- Added support for the Pointer Events API enabling consistent access to mouse, trackpad, touch, and Apple Pencil events.\n- Added support for the Visual Viewport API for adjusting web content to avoid overlays, such as the onscreen keyboard.\n- Added support for programmatic paste with user consent to Safari for iOS.\n- Updated editing callouts to avoid in-page controls.\n- Added intelligent whitespace to editable WebViews and editable areas of webpages.\n\n### Payment Request API\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added support for Apple Pay on the Web to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView]. Note that using script injection APIs, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKUserScript] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView\/evaluateJavaScript(_:completionHandler:)] disables Apple Pay for that view.\n\n### Media\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added support for the `decodingInfo()` method of the Media Capabilities API for checking supported codecs, efficiently supported codecs, and optional codec features including alpha.\n- Added the ability to Safari for macOS to share your screen with others using only web technologies. Plug-ins are no longer required.\n- Updated Safari for iPad to support Media Source Extensions.\n- Added support for the `navigator.mediaDevices` property of the Media Capture and Streams API to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SafariServices\/SFSafariViewController].\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Transparency in video with an alpha channel now works correctly for all supported video formats.\n\n### Safari App Extension API\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added an API for page navigation notifications.\n- Added support for associated Safari App Extensions receiving blocked content notifications from Content Blocker Safari Extensions.\n\n### Web Inspector and Tools\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added Safari WebDriver to iOS.\n- Added importing and exporting of recorded timeline data.\n- Added the CPU Usage Timeline for analyzing and improving the power efficiency of websites.\n- Added the Audit tab for running tests against web content including a built-in accessibility audit, importing and exporting results, and creating custom audits.\n- Added the Changes sidebar in the Elements tab to track CSS changes in the Styles sidebar.\n- Added the Device Settings menu to override developer-related Safari settings when Web Inspector is connected to an iOS device.\n- Added a Security tab to the resources view of the Network tab to review certificates and TLS settings.\n- Increased the performance of Web Inspector for large sites.\n\n#### Removed Features\n\n- Removed support for WebSQL.\n- Removed support for Legacy Safari Extensions.\n- Disabled `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch `on iPad. All frames and scrollable overflow areas now use accelerated one-finger scrolling without changing stacking.\n- Disabled frame flattening on iOS. Frames now render in the same way as a desktop browser.\n\n### AuthenticationServices Framework\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASAuthorizationController] to implement Sign In with Apple and to use a system-provided sign-in account picker for accounts stored in iCloud Keychain.\n- Added [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASWebAuthenticationSession] to the SDK for macOS.\n- Added support for using web browsers other than Safari to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASWebAuthenticationSession] on macOS. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AuthenticationServices\/ASWebAuthenticationSessionWebBrowserSessionManager].\n\n### WebKit Framework\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added API to control desktop and mobile content modes.\n\n### JavaScriptCore Framework\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added an API for loading ES6 modules.\n\n### LinkPresentation Framework\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added LinkPresentation to the SDKs, enabling presentation of web links and better share sheet integration.\n\n### Mac Catalyst\n\n#### Differences From iOS\n\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SafariServices\/SFSafariViewController] opens the URL in the user’s web browser and immediately calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SafariServices\/SFSafariViewControllerDelegate\/safariViewControllerDidFinish(_:)].\n\n## Version 13\n\n- **Safari 13.1 Release Notes**: Released March 24, 2020 — Version 13.1 (15609.1.20)\n\n",
