You do this by providing enumerators.\n\nTo provide an enumerator, create a class that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.fileprovider\/documentation\/FileProvider\/NSFileProviderEnumerator] protocol. The system uses this enumerator to represent an item (a folder or a document) managed by your file provider. In addition, the system uses the enumerator to track any changes to the item.\n\nThe system also uses an enumerator to track the working set (a set of special items like Recents or Favorites).\n\nYou create enumerators to handle these use cases:\n\nOnce requested, an enumerator provides both the content and any changes for an item. When the system stops accessing the item, it calls the enumerator’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.fileprovider\/documentation\/FileProvider\/NSFileProviderEnumerator\/invalidate()] method. For example, if you return an enumerator that provides the content of a directory, as long as the enumerator is active, the system also uses it to enumerate changes to the directory.\n\nThe system may have multiple, active enumerators for different items. Some of these may represent items that are currently displayed on screen. Others may be items that are no longer displayed, but the system has retained the enumerator for performance reasons. You need to inform the system of any changes to the content managed by any of the active enumerators, as well as any changes to the working set (whether or not it has an active enumerator).",
