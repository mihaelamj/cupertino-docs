Must not be `nil`.\n- **object**: Sender of the notification. May be `nil`.\n- **userInfo**: Dictionary containing additional information. May be `nil`.\n\n\n- **deliverImmediately**: Specifies when to deliver the notification. When [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], the receiver delivers notifications to their observers according to the suspended-notification behavior specified in the corresponding dispatch table entry. When [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], the receiver delivers the notification immediately to its observers.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis is the preferred method for posting notifications.\n\nThe `notificationInfo` dictionary is serialized as a property list, so it can be passed to another task.
