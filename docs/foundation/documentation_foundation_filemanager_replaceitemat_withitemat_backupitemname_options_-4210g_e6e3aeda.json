It is recommended that you put this item in a temporary directory as provided by the OS. If a temporary directory is not available, put this item in a uniquely named directory that is in the same directory as the original item.\n- **backupItemName**: If provided, the name used to create a backup of the original item.\n\nThe backup is placed in the same directory as the original item. If an error occurs during the creation of the backup item, the operation fails. If there is already an item with the same name as the backup item, that item will be removed.\n\nThe backup item will be removed in the event of success unless the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/ItemReplacementOptions\/withoutDeletingBackupItem] option is provided in options.\n- **options**: The options to use during the replacement. Typically, you pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/ItemReplacementOptions\/usingNewMetadataOnly] for this parameter, which uses only the metadata from the new item. You can also combine the options described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/ItemReplacementOptions] using the C-bitwise OR operator.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe URL of the new item. If no new file system object is required, the URL object in this parameter may be the same passed to the `originalItemURL` parameter. However, if a new file system object is required, the URL object may be different. For example, replacing an RTF document with an RTFD document requires the creation of a new file.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBy default, the creation date, permissions, Finder label and color, and Spotlight comments of the original item are preserved on the new item.
