The delegate may return `cachedResponse` unmodified, return a modified cached response, or return `nil` if no cached response should be stored for the connection.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method is called only if the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLProtocol] handling the request decides to cache the response. As a rule, responses are cached only when all of the following are true:\n\n- The request is for an HTTP or HTTPS URL (or your own custom networking protocol that supports caching).\n- The request was successful (with a status code in the `200–299` range).\n- The provided response came from the server, rather than out of the cache.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLRequest] object’s cache policy allows caching.\n- The cache-related headers in the server’s response (if present) allow caching.\n- The response size is small enough to reasonably fit within the cache. (For example, if you provide a disk cache, the response must be no larger than about 5% of the disk cache size.)\n\n",
