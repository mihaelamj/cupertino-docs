  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nYou use this method to perform read-related operations on a file or directory in a coordinated manner. This method executes synchronously, blocking the current thread until the `reader` block finishes executing. Before executing that block, though, the file coordinator waits until other relevant file presenter objects finish in-progress actions. Similarly, your read operation may cause pending actions for other file presenters to wait until your operations are complete. Whether or not the file coordinator waits depends on whether the item being read is a file or a directory and also depends on other related operations.\n\nWhen invoking these methods, declare a `__block` variable before the accessor block and initialize it to a value that signals failure, and then inside the accessor block set it to a value that indicates success. If the coordinated operation fails, then the accessor block never runs. The sentinel variable still holds a value that indicates failure, and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSError] out parameter contains a reference that describes the error.\n\nThis method calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFilePresenter\/relinquishPresentedItem(toReader:)] method of any relevant file presenters. This method is called for file presenters in the current process and in other processes. Depending on the options you specify, other methods of the file presenters may also be called. When reading a file package directory, file presenter objects that are currently reading the contents of that file package also receive these notifications. All of the called methods must return successfully before the file coordinator executes your block. If multiple file presenters are operating on the item, the order in which those presenters are notified is undefined.\n\nIf the device has not yet downloaded the file at the given URL, this method blocks (potentially for a long time) while the file is downloaded. If the file cannot be downloaded, this method fails. Alternatively; use a metadata query to check for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSMetadataUbiquitousItemDownloadingStatusKey] key, and then call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/startDownloadingUbiquitousItem(at:)] method to download the file before trying to read it.\n\nIf you want to perform a write operation from inside a read block, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/coordinate(writingItemAt:options:writingItemAt:options:error:byAccessor:)] method.\n\nIf you want to perform a batch read operation on multiple files, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/prepare(forReadingItemsAt:options:writingItemsAt:options:error:byAccessor:)] method instead.",

If other objects or processes are acting on the item at the URL, the actual URL passed to the `reader` parameter may be different than the one in this parameter.\n- **options**: One of the reading options described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/ReadingOptions]. If you pass no options, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFilePresenter\/savePresentedItemChanges(completionHandler:)] method of relevant file presenters is called before your block executes.\n- **outError**: On input, a pointer to a pointer for an error object. If a file presenter encounters an error while preparing for this read operation, that error is returned in this parameter and the block in the `reader` parameter is not executed. If you cancel this operation before the `reader` block is executed, this parameter contains an error object on output.\n- **reader**: A [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/DevPedia-CocoaCore\/Block.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008195-CH3] containing the file operations you want to perform in a coordinated manner. This block receives an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] object containing the URL of the item and returns no value.
