  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nAn NSURL object initialized with `URLString` and `baseURL`. If `URLString` was malformed, returns `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method allows you to create a URL relative to a base path or URL. For example, if you have the URL for a folder on disk and the name of a file within that folder, you can construct a URL for the file by providing the folder’s URL as the base path (with a trailing slash) and the filename as the string part.\n\nTo check if `URLString` is strictly valid according to the RFC, use the new `[NSURL URLWithString:URLString encodingInvalidCharacters:NO]` method. This method leaves all characters as they are and returns `nil` if `URLString` is explicitly invalid.\n\nFor apps linked before iOS 17, this method expects `URLString` to contain only characters that are allowed in a properly formed URL. All other characters must be properly percent encoded. Any percent-encoded characters are interpreted using UTF-8 encoding.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/init(string:relativeTo:)] is the designated initializer for NSURL.",
