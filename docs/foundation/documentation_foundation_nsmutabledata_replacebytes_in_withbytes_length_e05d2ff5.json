Any bytes past `range` in the receiver are shifted to accommodate the new bytes. You can therefore pass `NULL` for `replacementBytes` and `0` for `replacementLength` to delete bytes in the receiver in the range `range`. You can also replace a range (which might be zero-length) with more bytes than the length of the range, which has the effect of insertion (or “replace some and insert more”).",

The range must not exceed the bounds of the receiver.\n- **replacementBytes**: The data to insert into the receiver’s contents.\n- **replacementLength**: The number of bytes to take from `replacementBytes`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the length of `range` is not equal to `replacementLength`, the receiver is resized to accommodate the new bytes. Any bytes past `range` in the receiver are shifted to accommodate the new bytes.
