  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis method lets you asynchronously perform coordinated read or writes. You can specify any combination of individual read or write operations. The file coordinator waits asynchronously to get access to the files and then invokes the accessor block on the specified queue.\n\nIf an error occurs while waiting for access, an error message is passed to the block. You must check the block’s error parameter before accessing any of the files. If the error parameter is set to `nil`, you can freely perform the read and write operations described by your intents. Otherwise, you may not access the files.\n\nAdditionally, always use the URL property of your intent objects when accessing the files inside the accessor block. The system updates this property to account for any changes to the underlying files. For example, if the files are moved or renamed, the system updates this URL property to match.\n\nYour file coordinator has access to the files only until the accessor block returns. Do not dispatch tasks that continue to access these files onto other threads or queues. That can cause your app to access the files outside of file coordination, and could result in data corruption or data loss.\n\nIn general, coordinated-read operations wait for coordinated-write operations on the same URL. Coordinated-write operations wait for both coordinated-read and coordinated-write operations on the same URL. Multiple coordinated reads can occur simultaneously without blocking each other.\n\nPerforming a coordinated read or coordinated write on the contents of a file package is treated as a coordinated read or write to the package as a whole. In general, coordinated access to a directory that is not a file package is not affected by coordinated access to the directory’s contents. Similarly, accessing the contents does not affect the directory. However, if you make a coordinated write operation using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/WritingOptions\/forDeleting], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/WritingOptions\/forMoving], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/WritingOptions\/forReplacing] options, all coordinated access to the directory and its contents interact as if they were accessing the same URL.\n\nCoordinated reads and writes from the same file coordinator instance never block each other.
