You can obtain a common cookie storage by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/HTTPCookieStorage\/sharedCookieStorage(forGroupContainerIdentifier:)] method.\n- macOS (non-sandboxed) — As of macOS 10.11, each app has its own cookie storage. Prior to macOS 10.11, a common cookie store is shared among the user’s apps.\n- macOS (sandboxed) — Same as iOS.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWebView] — `UIWebView` instances within an app inherit the parent app’s shared cookie storage.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKWebView] — Each `WKWebView` instance has its own cookie storage. See the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WebKit\/WKHTTPCookieStore] class for more information.\n\nSession cookies (where the cookie object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/HTTPCookie\/isSessionOnly] property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true]) are local to a single process and are not shared.\n\n\n\n### Subclassing notes\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/HTTPCookieStorage] class is usable as-is, but you can subclass it.
