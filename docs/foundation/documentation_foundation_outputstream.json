  "overview" : "## Overview\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/OutputStream] is “toll-free bridged” with its Core Foundation counterpart, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFWriteStream]. For more information on toll-free bridging, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/CocoaEncyclopedia\/Toll-FreeBridgin\/Toll-FreeBridgin.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40010810-CH2].\n\n### Subclassing Notes\n\n`NSOutputStream` is a concrete subclass of `NSStream` that lets you write data to a stream. Although `NSOutputStream` is probably sufficient for most situations requiring this capability, you can create a subclass of `NSOutputStream` if you want more specialized behavior (for example, you want to record statistics on the data in a stream).\n\n#### Methods to Override\n\nTo create a subclass of `NSOutputStream` you may have to implement initializers for the type of stream data supported and suitably reimplement existing initializers. You must also provide complete implementations of the following methods:\n\nFrom the current write pointer, take up to the number of bytes specified in the `maxLength:` parameter from the client-supplied buffer (first parameter) and put them onto the stream. The buffer must be of the size specified by the second parameter. To prepare for the next operation, offset the write pointer by the number of bytes written. Return a signed integer based on the outcome of the current operation:\n\nReturn [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if the stream can currently accept more data, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] if it cannot. If you want to be semantically compatible with `NSOutputStream`, return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if a write must be attempted to determine if space is available.",
