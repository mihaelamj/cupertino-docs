The classes, protocols, and data types defined by Foundation are used throughout the macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS SDKs.\n\n## Fundamentals\n\n- **Numbers, Data, and Basic Values**: Work with primitive values and other fundamental types used throughout Cocoa.\n- **Strings and Text**: Create and process strings of Unicode characters, use regular expressions to find patterns, and perform natural language analysis of text.\n- **Collections**: Use arrays, dictionaries, sets, and specialized collections to store and iterate groups of objects or values.\n- **Dates and Times**: Compare dates and times, and perform calendar and time zone calculations.\n- **Units and Measurement**: Label numeric quantities with physical dimensions to allow locale-aware formatting and conversion between related units.\n- **Data Formatting**: Convert numbers, dates, measurements, and other values to and from locale-aware string representations.\n- **Filters and Sorting**: Use predicates, expressions, and sort descriptors to examine elements in collections and other services.\n\n## App Support\n\n- **Task Management**: Manage your app’s work and how it interacts with system services like Handoff and Shortcuts.\n- **Resources**: Access assets and other data bundled with your app.\n- **Notifications**: Design patterns for broadcasting information and for subscribing to broadcasts.\n- **App Extension Support**: Manage the interaction between an app extension and its hosting app.\n- **Errors and Exceptions**: Respond to problem situations in your interactions with APIs, and fine-tune your app for better debugging.\n- **Scripting Support**: Allow users to control your app with AppleScript and other automation technologies, or run scripts from within your app.\n\n## Files and Data Persistence\n\n- **File System**: Create, read, write, and examine files and folders in the file system.\n- **Archives and Serialization**: Convert objects and values to and from property list, JSON, and other flat binary representations.\n- **Settings**: Configure your app using data you store persistently on the local disk or in iCloud.\n- **Spotlight**: Search for files and other items on the local device, and index your app’s content for searching.\n- **iCloud**: Manage files and key-value data that automatically synchronize among a user’s iCloud devices.\n- **Optimizing Your App’s Data for iCloud Backup**: Minimize the space and time that backups take to create by excluding purgeable and nonpurgeable data from backups.\n\n## Networking\n\n- **URL Loading System**: Interact with URLs and communicate with servers using standard Internet protocols.\n- **Bonjour**: Advertise services for easy discovery on local networks, or discover services advertised by others.\n\n## Low-Level Utilities\n\n- **XPC**: Manage secure interprocess communication.\n- **Object Runtime**: Get low-level support for basic Objective-C features, Cocoa design patterns, and Swift integration.\n- **Processes and Threads**: Manage your app’s interaction with the host operating system and other processes, and implement low-level concurrency features.\n- **Streams, Sockets, and Ports**: Use low-level Unix features to manage input and output among files, processes, and the network.\n\n## Reference\n\n- **Foundation Enumerations**\n- **Foundation Data Types**: This document describes the data types and constants found in the Foundation framework.\n\n## Articles\n\n- **allocWithZone:**: Returns an instance of the `NSMachPort` class.\n- **init**: Returns an initialized `NSOperation` object.\n- **initWithCoefficient:constant**: Initializes the unit converter with the coefficient and constant you specify.\n- **intersectSet:**: Removes from the receiving set each object that isn’t a member of another given set.\n- **isEqual:**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver and a given object have identical URL strings and base URLs.\n- **minusSet:**: Removes each object in another given set from the receiving set, if present.\n- **NSJavaBundleCleanup**: This function has been deprecated.\n- **NSJavaBundleSetup**: This function has been deprecated.\n- **NSJavaClassesForBundle**: Loads the Java classes located in the specified bundle.\n- **NSJavaClassesFromPath**: Loads the Java classes located at the specified path.\n- **NSJavaDidCreateVirtualMachineNotification**: Notification sent after the Java virtual machine is created.\n- **NSJavaDidSetupVirtualMachineNotification**: Notification sent after the Java virtual machine is set up.\n- **NSJavaNeedsToLoadClasses**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a virtual machine is needed or if Java classes are provided.\n- **NSJavaNeedsVirtualMachine**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether a Java virtual machine is required.\n- **NSJavaObjectNamedInPath**: Creates an instance of the named class using the class loader previously specified at the given path.\n- **NSJavaProvidesClasses**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether Java classes are provided.\n- **NSJavaSetup**: Loads the Java virtual machine with specified parameters.\n- **NSJavaSetupVirtualMachine**: Sets up the Java virtual machine.\n- **NSJavaWillCreateVirtualMachineNotification**: Notification sent before the Java virtual machine is created.\n- **NSJavaWillSetupVirtualMachineNotification**: Notification sent before the Java virtual machine is set up.\n- **NSLocaleSensitivePredicateOption**: Indicates that strings to be compared using `<`, `<=`, `=`, `=>`, `>` should be handled in a locale-aware fashion.\n- **NSMaxXEdge**: The maximum X edge. This is equivalent to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGRectEdge\/maxXEdge].\n- **NSMaxYEdge**: The maximum X edge. This is equivalent to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGRectEdge\/maxXEdge].\n- **NSMinXEdge**: The minimum X edge. This is equivalent to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGRectEdge\/minXEdge].\n- **NSMinYEdge**: The minimum Y edge. This is equivalent to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGRectEdge\/minYEdge].\n- **objCType**: Returns a C string containing the Objective-C type of the data contained in the number object.\n- **setURI:**: Sets the URI of the receiver.\n- **unionSet:**: Adds each object in another given set to the receiving set, if not present.\n\n## Structures\n\n- **DiscontiguousAttributedSubstring**: A discontiguous portion of an attributed string.\n\n",
