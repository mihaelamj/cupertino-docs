When launching a task from a secondary thread or background queue, you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Process\/terminationHandler] property instead for greater control over the execution context of any operations to be performed after the task finishes.\n\nThis notification can be posted either when the task has exited normally or as a result of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Process\/terminate()] being sent to the `NSTask` object.
