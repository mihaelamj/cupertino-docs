May return `nil` if the receiver is not a valid kind of node (see discussion).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method is applicable only to `NSXMLNode` objects representing elements, attributes, namespaces, processing instructions, and DTD-declaration nodes. If the receiver is not an object of one of these kinds, this method returns `nil`. For example, in the following construction:\n\nThe returned name for the element is “title”. If the name is associated with a namespace, the qualified name is returned. For example, if you create an element with local name “foo” and URI “http:\/\/bar.com” and the namespace “xmlns:baz=‘http:\/\/bar.com’” is applied to this node, when you invoke this method on the node you get “baz:foo”.",
