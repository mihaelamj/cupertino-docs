In the `Package.swift` file of an existing HTTP server project, add `.package(path: \"\/path\/to\/swift-nio-resumable-upload\")` as one of the dependencies.\n2. Import `NIOResumableUpload` in your SwiftNIO bootstrapping code.\n3. Create an upload context: `let uploadContext = HTTPResumableUploadContext(origin: \"https:\/\/example.com\")`.\n4. Wrap your HTTP server channel handler within `HTTPResumableUploadHandler`.\n\n## Uploading\n\n- **Uploading data to a website**: Post data from your app to servers.\n- **Uploading streams of data**: Send a stream of data to a server.\n- **Pausing and resuming uploads**: Pause and resume an upload without starting over, even when the connection is interrupted.\n\n",
