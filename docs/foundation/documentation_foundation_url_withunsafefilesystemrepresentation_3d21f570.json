For example, if the URL contains an accented character and the file system only supports ASCII, no file system representation is possible.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe value returned by your closure, if any.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe file system representation is a null-terminated C string with canonical UTF-8 encoding.\n\n\n\n## Working with file URLs\n\n- **isFileURL**: A Boolean that is true if the scheme is `file:`.\n- **hasDirectoryPath**: A Boolean that is true if the URL path represents a directory.\n- **resolveSymlinksInPath()**: Resolves any symlinks in the path of a file URL.\n- **resolvingSymlinksInPath()**: Resolves any symlinks in the path of a file URL.\n- **standardize()**: Standardizes the path of a file URL.\n\n",
