In other words, this method effectively begins an infinite loop that processes data from the run loop’s input sources and timers.\n\nManually removing all known input sources and timers from the run loop is not a guarantee that the run loop will exit. macOS can install and remove additional input sources as needed to process requests targeted at the receiver’s thread. Those sources could therefore prevent the run loop from exiting.\n\nIf you want the run loop to terminate, you shouldn’t use this method. Instead, use one of the other run methods and also check other arbitrary conditions of your own, in a loop.
