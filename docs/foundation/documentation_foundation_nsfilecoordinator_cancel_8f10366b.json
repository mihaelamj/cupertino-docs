If the block passed to the file coordination call has not yet been executed—perhaps because the file coordinator is still waiting for a response from other file presenters—the file coordinator method stops waiting for a response, does not execute its block, and returns an error object with the error code [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserCancelledError-swift.var]. However, if the block is already being executed, the file coordinator method does not return until the block finishes executing.\n\nYou can call this method from any thread of your application and it returns immediately without waiting for the file coordinator object to respond. Thus, when this method returns, you cannot assume that the read or write operation occurred or did not occur. (In fact, it is possible for this method to return while the file coordinator is in the middle of executing a block.) If you want to know whether the operation actually occurred, you must track it yourself by setting a flag when the block starts executing or by using some other means.",
