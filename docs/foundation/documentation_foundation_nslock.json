Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSRecursiveLock] class to implement recursive locks instead.\n\nUnlocking a lock that is not locked is considered a programmer error and should be fixed in your code. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSLock] class reports such errors by printing an error message to the console when they occur.",
