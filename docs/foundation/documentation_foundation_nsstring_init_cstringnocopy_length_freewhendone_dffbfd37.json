The receiver becomes the owner of `cString`; if `flag` is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] it will free the memory when it no longer needs it, but if `flag` is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] it won’t. Returns an initialized object, which might be different from the original receiver.\n\nYou can use this method to create an immutable string from an immutable (`const char *`) C-string buffer. If you receive a warning message, you can disregard it; its purpose is simply to warn you that the C string passed as the method’s first argument may be modified. If you make certain the `freeWhenDone` argument to `initWithStringNoCopy` is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], the C string passed as the method’s first argument cannot be modified, so you can safely use `initWithStringNoCopy` to create an immutable string from an immutable (`const char *`) C-string buffer.",
