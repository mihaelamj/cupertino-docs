After taking any appropriate steps, you must execute the block in the `writer` parameter to let the waiting object know that it may now proceed with its task. If you want to be notified when the writer has completed its task, pass your own block to the writer and use that block to reacquire the file or URL for your own uses.\n\nIf the writer changes the file or directory, you do not need to incorporate those changes in your reacquirer block. Instead, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFilePresenter\/presentedItemDidChange()] method and use it to detect when a writer actually wrote its changes to disk.\n\nThe following listing shows a simple implementation of this method that sets a Boolean flag that the file being monitored is not writable at the moment.
