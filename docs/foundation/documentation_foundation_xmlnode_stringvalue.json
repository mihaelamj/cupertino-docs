If the object value is one of the standard, built-in ones ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNumber], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSCalendarDate], and so on), the string value is in canonical format as defined by the W3C XML Schema Data Types specification.
