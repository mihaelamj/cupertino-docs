This method is received after the extension is initialized, but before the principal object is asked to do anything with the context. For example, if the principal object is a view controller, it receives this message before [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/loadView()] is called. After an extension receives this message, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/extensionContext] property of the view controller returns a non`nil` value.\n\nIf your subclass conforms to this protocol and overrides `beginRequestWithExtensionContext:`, the subclass is expected to call `[super beginRequestWithExtensionContext:]`.",
