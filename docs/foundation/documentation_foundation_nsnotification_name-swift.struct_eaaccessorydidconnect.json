The `userInfo` dictionary contains an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ExternalAccessory\/EAAccessoryKey], whose value is an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ExternalAccessory\/EAAccessory] object representing the accessory that is now connected. If a Bluetooth accessory was selected by the user in the Bluetooth picker, this dictionary contains the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ExternalAccessory\/EAAccessorySelectedKey] key. Before delivery of this notification can occur, you must call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ExternalAccessory\/EAAccessoryManager\/registerForLocalNotifications()] method to let the system know you are interested in receiving this notification.\n\nAfter receiving this notification, always check the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ExternalAccessory\/EAAccessory\/protocolStrings] array of the newly connected accessory object to verify that the required protocol is present before trying to open a session. In some cases, the system may send the connection notification before authentication has completed, resulting in an empty [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ExternalAccessory\/EAAccessory\/protocolStrings] array and a subsequent disconnection message. If this happens, the system sends another connection message later, when authentication succeeds.",
