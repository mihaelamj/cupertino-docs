That is, the `rect` argument’s `origin` field specifies the rendering origin, and that point is interpreted as the baseline origin by default. If the string drawing option `NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin` is specified, `origin` is interpreted as the upper left corner of the line fragment rectangle, and the method behaves in multiline configuration.\n\nThe `size` field specifies the text container size. The `width` part of the size field specifies the maximum line fragment width if larger than `0.0`. The `height` defines the maximum size that can be occupied with text if larger than `0.0` and `NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin` is specified. If `NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin` is not specified, height is ignored and considered to be single-line rendering (`NSLineBreakByWordWrapping` and `NSLineBreakByCharWrapping` are treated as `NSLineBreakByClipping`).\n\nYou should only invoke this method when there is a current graphics context.",
