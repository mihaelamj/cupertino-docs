  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nEach process has a single, shared [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo] object known as a *process information agent* that can return information such as arguments, environment variables, host name, and process name. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/processInfo] class method returns the shared agent for the current process. For example, the following line returns the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo] object, which then provides the name of the current process:\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo] class also includes the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/operatingSystemVersion] property, which returns an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/OperatingSystemVersion] structure identifying the operating system version on which the process is executing.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo] objects attempt to interpret environment variables and command-line arguments in the user’s default C string encoding if they can’t convert to Unicode as UTF-8 strings. If neither the Unicode nor C string conversion works, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo] object ignores these values.\n\n### Manage Activities\n\nThe system has heuristics to improve battery life, performance, and responsiveness of applications for the benefit of the user. You can use the following methods to manage *activities* that give hints to the system that your application has special requirements:\n\nIn response to creating an activity, the system disables some or all of the heuristics so your application can finish quickly while still providing responsive behavior if the user needs it.\n\nYou use activities when your application performs a long-running operation. If the activity can take different amounts of time (for example, calculating the next move in a chess game), it should use this API to ensure correct behavior when the amount of data or the capabilities of the user’s computer varies. Activities fall into two major categories:\n\nIn addition, if your application requires high priority input\/output (I\/O), you can include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/ActivityOptions\/latencyCritical] flag (using a bitwise `OR`). You should only use this flag for activities like audio or video recording that require high priority I\/O.\n\nIf your activity takes place synchronously inside an event callback on the main thread, you don’t need to use this API.\n\nBe aware that failing to end these activities for an extended period of time can have significant negative impacts on the performance of your user’s computer, so be sure to use only the minimum amount of time required. User preferences may override your application’s request.\n\nYou can also use this API to control automatic termination or sudden termination (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo#Support-Sudden-Termination]). For example, the following code brackets the work to protect it from sudden termination:\n\nThe above example is equivalent to the following code, which uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/disableAutomaticTermination(_:)] method:\n\nBecause this API returns an object, it may be easier to pair begins and ends than when using the automatic termination API. If your app deallocates the object before the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/endActivity(_:)] call, the activity ends automatically.\n\nThis API also provides a mechanism to disable system-wide idle sleep and display idle sleep. These can have a large impact on the user experience, so be careful to end activities that disable sleep (including [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/ActivityOptions\/userInitiated]).\n\n### Support Sudden Termination\n\nmacOS 10.6 and later includes a mechanism that allows the system to log out or shut down more quickly by, whenever possible, killing applications instead of requesting that they quit themselves.\n\nYour application can enable this capability on a global basis and then manually override its availability during actions that could cause data corruption or a poor user experience by allowing sudden termination.\n\nAlternatively, your application can manually enable and disable this functionality. Creating a process assigns a counter that indicates if the process is safe to terminate. You decrement and increment the counter using the methods [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/enableSuddenTermination()] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/disableSuddenTermination()]. A value of `0` enables the system to terminate the process without first sending a notification or event.\n\nYour application can support sudden termination upon launch by adding a key to the application’s `Info.plist` file. If the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSSupportsSuddenTermination] key exists in the `Info.plist` file and has a value of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], it’s the equivalent of calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/enableSuddenTermination()] during your application launch. This allows the system to terminate the process immediately. You can still override this behavior by invoking [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/disableSuddenTermination()].\n\nTypically, you disable sudden termination whenever your app defers work that the app must complete before it terminates. If, for example, your app defers writing data to disk and enables sudden termination, you should bracket the sensitive operations with a call to [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/disableSuddenTermination()], perform the necessary operations, and then send a balancing [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/enableSuddenTermination()] message.\n\nIn agents or daemon executables that don’t depend on AppKit, you can manually invoke [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/enableSuddenTermination()] right away. You can then use the enable and disable methods whenever the process has work it must do before it terminates.\n\nSome AppKit functionality automatically disables sudden termination on a temporary basis to ensure data integrity.\n\n### Monitor Thermal State to Adjust App Performance\n\n*Thermal state* indicates the level of heat generated by logic components as they run apps. As the thermal state increases, the system decreases heat by reducing the speed of the processors. Optimize your app’s performance by monitoring the thermal state and reducing system usage as the thermal state increases. Query the current state with [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/thermalState-swift.property] to determine if your app needs to reduce system usage. You can register the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/thermalStateDidChangeNotification] for notifications of a change in thermal state.

If the activity can take different amounts of time (for example, calculating the next move in a chess game), it should use this API to ensure correct behavior when the amount of data or the capabilities of the user’s computer varies. Activities fall into two major categories:\n\n- *User-initiated* activities are explicitly started by the user. Examples include exporting or downloading a user-specified file.\n- *Background* activities perform the normal operations of your application and aren’t explicitly started by the user. Examples include autosaving, indexing, and automatic downloading of files.\n\nIn addition, if your application requires high priority input\/output (I\/O), you can include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/ProcessInfo\/ActivityOptions\/latencyCritical] flag (using a bitwise `OR`).
