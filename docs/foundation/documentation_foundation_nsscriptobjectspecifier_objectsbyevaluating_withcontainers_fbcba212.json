This method then uses key-value coding to obtain the object or objects associated with the key; it returns these objects or `nil` if there are no matching values in containers. If there are multiple matching values, they are returned in an `NSArray`; if matching values are `nil`, `NSNull` objects are substituted. If `containers` is an `NSArray`, the method recursively evaluates each element in the array and returns an `NSArray` with evaluated objects (including `NSNulls`) in their corresponding slots.",
