The method uses key-value coding to obtain values based on the receiver’s key. It returns the number of such matching objects by indirection in `numRefs`. It returns `nil` directly and –1 via `numRefs` if all objects in the container (or the sole object) match the value of the receiver’s key. This method is invoked by [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSScriptObjectSpecifier\/objectsByEvaluating(withContainers:)]. The default implementation returns `nil` directly and –1 indirectly via `numRefs`.",
