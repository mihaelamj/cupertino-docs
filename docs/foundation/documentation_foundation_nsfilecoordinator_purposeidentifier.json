If you are coordinating file access on behalf of a file presenter, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/init(filePresenter:)] and do not attempt to set a custom purpose identifier. Every file coordinator instance initialized with the same file presenter has the same purpose identifier.\n\nYou may need to set a custom purpose identifier for the following reasons:\n\n- Your application has a File Provider extension. Any file coordination done on behalf of the File Provider needs to be done using the File Provider’s purpose identifier.\n- You have two separate subsystems that need to work together to perform a single high-level operation, and both subsystems perform their own coordinated reads or writes. Using the same purpose identifier in both subsystems prevents possible deadlocks between the two subsystems.\n\nWhen creating custom purpose identifiers, you can use a reverse DNS style string, such as `com.example.MyApplication.MyPurpose`, or a UUID string. You cannot use `nil` or zero-length strings.\n\n\n\n## Managing File Presenters\n\n- **addFilePresenter(_:)**: Registers the specified file presenter object so that it can receive notifications.\n- **removeFilePresenter(_:)**: Unregisters the specified file presenter object.\n- **filePresenters**: Returns an array containing the currently registered file presenter objects.\n\n",
