  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe symbol of a unit is a string that can be used to designate a number as a quantity of a particular unit in user-readable representations. Units typically have symbols that are abbreviated and standardized, so as to be easily and unambiguously conveyed. For example, the `milePerHour` unit has the symbol `mph`. If a unit does not have a standardized or well-understood symbol, the lowercase name of the unit can be used. For example, the `metricCup` unit has the symbol `metric cup`.\n\nUnit symbols may incorporate a metric prefix to indicate a multiple or fraction of existing unit symbols. For example, the `kilogram` unit has the symbol `kg`, which uses the SI prefix k for kilo- to indicate a magnitude of 103 for the `gram` unit, and the `microgram` unit has the symbol `µg`, which uses the SI prefix µ for micro- to indicate a magnitude of 10-6 for the `gram` unit.",
