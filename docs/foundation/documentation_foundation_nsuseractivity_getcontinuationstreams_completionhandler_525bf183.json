The streams are provided by the completion handler in an unopened state, and the delegate should open them immediately to start communicating with the continuing side.\n\nContinuation streams are an optional feature of Handoff, and most user activities do not need them for successful continuation. When streams are needed, a simple request from the continuing app accompanied by a response from the originating app is enough for most continuation events.",
