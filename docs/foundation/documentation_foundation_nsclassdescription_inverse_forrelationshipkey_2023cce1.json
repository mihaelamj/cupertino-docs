For example, suppose an Employee class has a relationship named `department` to a Department class, and that Department has a relationship named `employees` to Employee. The statement:\n\nreturns the string `employees`.\n\nIf you have an instance of the class the receiver describes, you can use the `NSObject` instance method [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class\/inverse(forRelationshipKey:)] instead.",
