This method also performs several checks to ensure that the operation can actually run. For example, if the receiver was cancelled or is already finished, this method simply returns without calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation\/main()]. (In OS X v10.5, this method throws an exception if the operation is already finished.) If the operation is currently executing or is not ready to execute, this method throws an `NSInvalidArgumentException` exception. In OS X v10.5, this method catches and ignores any exceptions thrown by your [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation\/main()] method automatically. In macOS 10.6 and later, exceptions are allowed to propagate beyond this method. You should never allow exceptions to propagate out of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation\/main()] method.\n\nIf you are implementing a concurrent operation, you must override this method and use it to initiate your operation. Your custom implementation must not call `super` at any time. In addition to configuring the execution environment for your task, your implementation of this method must also track the state of the operation and provide appropriate state transitions. When the operation executes and subsequently finishes its work, it should generate KVO notifications for the `isExecuting` and `isFinished` key paths respectively.
