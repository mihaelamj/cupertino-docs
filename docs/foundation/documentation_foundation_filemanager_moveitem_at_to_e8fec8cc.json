If the item at `srcURL` is a directory, this method moves the directory and all of its contents, including any hidden files. If an item with the same name already exists at `dstURL`, this method stops the move attempt and returns an appropriate error. If the last component of `srcURL` is a symbolic link, only the link is moved to the new path; the item pointed to by the link remains at its current location.\n\nPrior to moving the item, the file manager asks its delegate if it should actually move it. It does this by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManagerDelegate\/fileManager(_:shouldMoveItemAt:to:)] method; if that method is not implemented it calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManagerDelegate\/fileManager(_:shouldMoveItemAtPath:toPath:)] method instead. If the item being moved is a directory, the file manager notifies the delegate only for the directory itself and not for any of its contents. If the delegate method returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], or if the delegate does not implement the appropriate methods, the file manager moves the file. If there is an error moving one out of several items, the file manager may also call the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManagerDelegate\/fileManager(_:shouldProceedAfterError:movingItemAt:to:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManagerDelegate\/fileManager(_:shouldProceedAfterError:movingItemAtPath:toPath:)] method to determine how to proceed.\n\nIf the source and destination of the move operation are not on the same volume, this method copies the item first and then removes it from its current location. This behavior may trigger additional delegate notifications related to copying and removing individual items.",
