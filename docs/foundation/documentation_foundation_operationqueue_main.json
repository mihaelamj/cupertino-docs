The execution of operations on the main thread is interleaved with the other tasks that must execute on the main thread, such as the servicing of events and the updating of an app’s user interface. The queue executes those operations in the run loop common modes, as represented by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/RunLoop\/Mode\/common] constant. The value of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/OperationQueue\/underlyingQueue] property for the queue is the dispatch queue for the main thread; this property cannot be set to another value.",
