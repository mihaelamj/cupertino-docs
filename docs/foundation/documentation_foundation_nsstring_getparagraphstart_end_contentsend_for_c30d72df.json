Pass `NULL` if you do not need this value (in which case the work to compute the value isn’t performed).\n- **parEndPtr**: Upon return, contains the index of the first character past the terminator of the paragraph containing the end of `aRange`. Pass `NULL` if you do not need this value (in which case the work to compute the value isn’t performed).\n- **contentsEndPtr**: Upon return, contains the index of the first character of the terminator of the paragraph containing the end of `aRange`. Pass `NULL` if you do not need this value (in which case the work to compute the value isn’t performed).\n- **range**: A range within the receiver. The value must not exceed the bounds of the receiver.\n\n## Discussion\n\nA paragraph is any segment of text delimited by a carriage return (`U+000D`), newline (`U+000A`), or paragraph separator (`U+2029`).\n\nIf `aRange` is contained with a single paragraph, of course, the returned indexes all belong to that paragraph.
