If the operation object has an explicit service level set, that value is used instead. The default value of this property depends on how you created the queue. For queues you create yourself, the default value is `NSOperationQualityOfServiceBackground`. For the queue returned by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/OperationQueue\/main] method, the default value is `NSOperationQualityOfServiceUserInteractive` and cannot be changed.\n\nService levels affect the priority with which operation objects are given access to system resources such as CPU time, network resources, disk resources, and so on. Operations with a higher quality of service level are given greater priority over system resources so that they may perform their task more quickly. You use service levels to ensure that operations responding to explicit user requests are given priority over less critical work.",
