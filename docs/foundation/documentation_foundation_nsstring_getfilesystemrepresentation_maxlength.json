The size of `buffer` must be large enough to contain `maxLength` bytes.\n- **max**: The maximum number of bytes in the string to return in `buffer` (including a terminating `NULL` character, which this method adds).\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if `buffer` is successfully filled with a file-system representation, otherwise [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] (for example, if `maxLength` would be exceeded or if the receiver can’t be represented in the file system’s encoding).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method operates by replacing the abstract path and extension separator characters (’`\/`’ and ‘`.`’ respectively) with their equivalents for the operating system.
