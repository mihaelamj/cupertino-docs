After placing this property-list file in your application bundle, you can use this method to extract context help information from it. To look up a particular entry, you specify the name of the original RTF help file in the `key` parameter of this method. For example, if your application project contains a help file named `Copy.rtf`, you would retrieve the text from this file by passing the value `@\"Copy.rtf\"` to the `key` parameter.\n\nThis method is declared in `NSHelpManager.h`.",
