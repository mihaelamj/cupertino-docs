The notification parameter to that method has a `userInfo` dictionary, and if that dictionary has the `NSApplicationLaunchUserNotificationKey` key. The value of that key is the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserNotification] object that caused the application to launch. The `NSUserNotification` object is delivered to the `NSApplication` delegate because that message will be sent before your application has a chance to set a delegate for the `NSUserNotificationCenter`.",
