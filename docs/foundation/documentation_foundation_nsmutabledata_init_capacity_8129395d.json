The returned object has the same memory alignment guarantees as `malloc(_:)`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method doesn’t necessarily allocate the requested memory right away. Mutable data objects allocate additional memory as needed, so `capacity` simply establishes the object’s initial capacity. When it does allocate the initial memory, though, it allocates the specified amount. This method sets the length of the data object to `0`.\n\nIf the capacity specified in `capacity` is greater than four memory pages in size, this method may round the amount of requested memory up to the nearest full page.",
