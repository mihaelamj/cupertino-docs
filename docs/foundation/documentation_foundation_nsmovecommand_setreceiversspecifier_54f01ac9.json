It performs the same function as the overridden method, with a critical difference: it causes the container specifier part of the passed-in object specifier to become the receiver specifier of the command, and the key part of the passed-in object specifier to become the key specifier. If, for example, `receiversRef` is a specifier for `the third paragraph of the first document`, the receiver specifier is `the first document` while the key specifier is `the third paragraph`.",
