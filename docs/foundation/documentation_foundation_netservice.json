  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] class represents a network service, either one your application publishes or is a client of. This class and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetServiceBrowser] class use multicast DNS to convey information about network services to and from your application. The API of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] provides a convenient way to publish the services offered by your application and to resolve the socket address for a service.\n\nThe types of services you access using [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] are the same types that you access directly using BSD sockets. HTTP and FTP are two services commonly provided by systems. (For a list of common services and the ports used by those services, see the file `\/etc\/services`.) Applications can also define their own custom services to provide specific data to clients.\n\nYou can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] class as either a publisher of a service or a client of a service. If your application publishes a service, your code must acquire a port and prepare a socket to communicate with clients. Once your socket is ready, you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] class to notify clients that your service is ready. If your application is the client of a network service, you can either create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] object directly (if you know the exact host and port information) or use an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetServiceBrowser] object to browse for services.\n\nTo publish a service, initialize your [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] object with the service name, domain, type, and port information. All of this information must be valid for the socket created by your application. Once initialized, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService\/publish()] method to broadcast your service information to the network.\n\nWhen connecting to a service, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetServiceBrowser] class to locate the service on the network and obtain the corresponding [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] object. Once you have the object, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService\/resolve(withTimeout:)] method to verify that the service is available and ready for your application. If it is, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService\/addresses] property provides the socket information you can use to connect to the service.\n\nThe methods of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] operate asynchronously so your application is not impacted by the speed of the network. All information about a service is returned to your application through the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] object’s delegate.
