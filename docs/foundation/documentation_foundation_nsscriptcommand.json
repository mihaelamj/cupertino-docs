Executing a command means either invoking the selector associated with the command on the object or objects designated to receive the command, or having the command perform its default implementation method ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSScriptCommand\/performDefaultImplementation()]).\n\nYour application most likely calls methods of `NSScriptCommand` to extract the command arguments. You do this either in the `performDefaultImplementation` method of a command subclass you have created, or in an object method designated as the selector to handle a particular command.\n\nAs part of Cocoa’s standard scripting implementation, `NSScriptCommand` and its subclasses can handle the default command set for AppleScript’s Standard suite for most applications without any subclassing. The Standard suite includes commands such as `copy`, `count`, `create`, `delete`, `exists`, and `move`, as well as common object classes such as `application`, `document`, and `window`.\n\nFor more information on working with script commands, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/ScriptableCocoaApplications\/SApps_script_cmds\/SAppsScriptCmds.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/20001242] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/ScriptableCocoaApplications\/SApps_intro\/SAppsIntro.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40002164].",
