  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWriting direction defines the base direction in which bidirectional text lays out its directional runs. A directional run is a contigous sequence of characters that all have the same effective directionality, which can be determined using the Unicode BiDi algorithm. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString\/WritingDirection\/leftToRight] writing direction puts the directional run that is placed first in the storage leftmost, and places subsequent directional runs towards the right. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString\/WritingDirection\/rightToLeft] writing direction puts the directional run that is placed first in the storage rightmost, and places subsequent directional runs towards the left.\n\nNote that writing direction is a property separate from a text’s alignment, its line layout direction, or its character direction. However, it is often used to determine the default alignment of a paragraph. E.g. English (a language with `Locale\/LanguageDirection-swift.enum\/leftToRight` [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Locale\/Language-swift.struct\/characterDirection]) is usually aligned to the left, but may be centered or aligned to the right for special effect, or to be visually more appealing in a user interface.\n\nFor bidirectional text to be perceived as laid out correctly, make sure that the writing direction is set to the value equivalent to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Locale\/Language-swift.struct\/characterDirection] of the primary language in the text. E.g. an English sentence that contains some Arabic (a language with `Locale\/LanguageDirection-swift.enum\/rightToLeft` [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Locale\/Language-swift.struct\/characterDirection]) words, should use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString\/WritingDirection\/leftToRight] writing direction. An Arabic sentence that contains some English words, should use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString\/WritingDirection\/rightToLeft] writing direction.\n\nWriting direction is always orthogonoal to the line layout direction chosen to display a certain text. The line layout direction is the direction in which a sequence of lines is placed in. E.g. English text is usually displayed with a line layout direction of `Locale\/LanguageDirection-swift.enum\/topToBottom`. While languages do have an associated line language direction (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Locale\/Language-swift.struct\/lineLayoutDirection]), not all displays of text follow the line layout direction of the text’s primary language.\n\nHorizontal script is script with a line layout direction of either `Locale\/LanguageDirection-swift.enum\/topToBottom` or `Locale\/LanguageDirection-swift.enum\/bottomToTop`. Vertical script has a `Locale\/LanguageDirection-swift.enum\/leftToRight` or `Locale\/LanguageDirection-swift.enum\/rightToLeft` line layout direction. In vertical scripts, a writing direction of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString\/WritingDirection\/leftToRight] is interpreted as top-to-bottom and a writing direction of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString\/WritingDirection\/rightToLeft] is interpreted as bottom-to-top.",
