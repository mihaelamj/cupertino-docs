Operations with a higher quality of service level are given greater priority over system resources so that they may perform their task more quickly. You use service levels to ensure that operations responding to explicit user requests are given priority over less critical work.\n\nThis property reflects the minimum service level needed to execute the operation effectively. The default value of this property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/QualityOfService\/default] and you should leave that value in place whenever possible. When changing the service level, use the minimum level that is appropriate for executing the corresponding task. For example, if the user initiates a task and is waiting for it to finish, assign the value [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/QualityOfService\/userInteractive] to this property. The system may give the operation a higher service level to the operation if the resources are available to do so.
