If the operation has already finished executing, this method has no effect. Canceling an operation that is currently in an operation queue, but not yet executing, makes it possible to remove the operation from the queue sooner than usual.\n\nIn macOS 10.6 and later, if an operation is in a queue but waiting on unfinished dependent operations, those operations are subsequently ignored. Because it is already cancelled, this behavior allows the operation queue to call the operation’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation\/start()] method sooner and clear the object out of the queue. If you cancel an operation that is not in a queue, this method immediately marks the object as finished. In each case, marking the object as ready or finished results in the generation of the appropriate KVO notifications.\n\nIn versions of macOS prior to 10.6, an operation object remains in the queue until all of its dependencies are removed through the normal processes.
