The possible flags (which can be combined with bitwise `OR` operations) are described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/BookmarkCreationOptions].\n\nTo create a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/BookmarkCreationOptions\/withSecurityScope] flag. When you later resolve the bookmark, you can use the resulting security-scoped URL to obtain read\/write access to the file-system resource pointed to by the URL.\n\nIf you instead want to create a security-scoped bookmark that, when resolved, enables you to obtain read-only access to a file-system resource, bitwise `OR` this parameter’s value with both the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/BookmarkCreationOptions\/withSecurityScope] option and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/BookmarkCreationOptions\/securityScopeAllowOnlyReadAccess] option.\n- **keys**: An array of names of URL resource properties to store as part of the bookmark. You can later access these values (without resolving the bookmark) by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/resourceValues(forKeys:fromBookmarkData:)] method.\n\nThe values of these properties must be of a type that the bookmark generation code can serialize. Specifically, the values can contain any of the following primitive types:\n\n- `NSString` or `CFString`\n- `NSData` or `CFData`\n- `NSDate` or `CFDate`\n- `NSNumber` or `CFNumber`\n- `CFBoolean`\n- `NSURL` or `CFURL`\n- `kCFNull` or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNull]\n- `CFUUID`\n\nIn addition, the properties can contain the following collection classes:\n\n- `NSArray` or `CFArray` containing only the above primitive types\n- `NSDictionary` or `CFDictionary` with `NSString` or `CFString` keys, in which all values contain only the above primitive types\n- **relativeURL**: The URL that the bookmark data will be relative to.\n\nIf you are creating a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox, use this parameter as follows:\n\n- To create an app-scoped bookmark, use a value of `nil`.\n- To create a document-scoped bookmark, use the *absolute* path (despite this parameter’s name) to the document file that is to own the new security-scoped bookmark.\n\nApp Sandbox does not restrict which URL values may be passed to this parameter.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA bookmark for the URL.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method returns bookmark data that can later be resolved into a URL object for a file even if the user moves or renames it (if the volume format on which the file resides supports doing so).\n\n\n\nYou can also use this method to create a security-scoped bookmark to support App Sandbox.
