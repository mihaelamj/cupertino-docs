For all other URLs, it contains a copy of the receiver.\n\n## Modifying and Converting a File URL\n\n- **filePathURL**: A file path URL that points to the same resource as the URL object. (read-only)\n- **fileReferenceURL()**: Returns a new file reference URL that points to the same resource as the receiver.\n- **appendingPathComponent(_:)**: Returns a new URL by appending a path component to the original URL.\n- **appendingPathComponent(_:isDirectory:)**: Returns a new URL by appending a path component to the original URL, along with a trailing slash if the component is a directory.\n- **appendingPathComponent(_:conformingTo:)**: Returns a URL by appending the specified path component with the file extension for a uniform type identifier.\n- **appendingPathExtension(_:)**: Returns a new URL by appending a path extension to the original URL.\n- **appendingPathExtension(for:)**: Returns a URL by appending the path extension for a uniform type identifier.\n- **deletingLastPathComponent**: A URL you create by removing the last path component from the receiver. (read-only)\n- **deletingPathExtension**: A URL you create by removing the path extension from the receiver, if any. (read-only)\n- **standardizingPath**: A URL that points to the same resource as the original URL using an absolute path. (read-only)\n- **hasDirectoryPath**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the URL string’s path represents a directory.\n\n",
