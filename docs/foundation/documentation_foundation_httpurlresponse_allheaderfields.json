See [http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc2616.txt] for a list of commonly used HTTP header fields.\n\nHTTP headers are case insensitive. To simplify your code, URL Loading System canonicalizes certain header field names into their standard form. For example, if the server sends a `content-length` header, it’s automatically adjusted to be `Content-Length`.\n\nWhen using Swift, this property is a standard dictionary, so its keys are case-sensitive. To perform a case-insensitive header lookup, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/HTTPURLResponse\/value(forHTTPHeaderField:)] method instead.\n\nIn Objective-C, the returned dictionary of headers is case-preserving during the set operation (unless the key already exists with a different case), and case-insensitive when looking up keys.\n\nFor example, if you set the header `X-foo`, and then later set the header `X-Foo`, the dictionary’s key is be `X-foo`, but the value comes from the `X-Foo` header.\n\n### Special considerations\n\nPrior to OS X v10.7 and iOS 5, canonicalization occurred for all header fields.
