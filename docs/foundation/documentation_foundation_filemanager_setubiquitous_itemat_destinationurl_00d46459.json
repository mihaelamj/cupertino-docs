For files located in an app’s sandbox, this involves physically removing the file from the sandbox container. (The system extends your app’s sandbox privileges to give it access to files it moves to iCloud.) You can also use this method to move files out of iCloud and back into a local directory.\n\nIf your app is presenting the file’s contents to the user, it must have an active file presenter object configured to monitor the specified file or directory before calling this method. When you specify [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] for the `flag` parameter, this method attempts to move the file or directory to the cloud and returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if it is successful. Calling this method also notifies your file presenter of the new location of the file so that your app can continue to operate on it.",

This URL must be constructed from a URL returned by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/url(forUbiquityContainerIdentifier:)] method, which you use to retrieve the desired iCloud container directory. The URL you specify may contain additional subdirectories so that you can organize your files hierarchically in iCloud.
