  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAttributed strings are character strings that have attributes for individual characters or ranges of characters. Attributes provide traits like visual styles for display, accessibility for guided access, and hyperlink data for linking between data sources. Attribute keys provide the name and value type of each attribute. System frameworks like Foundation and SwiftUI define common keys, and you can define your own in custom extensions.\n\n### String Attributes\n\nYou can apply an attribute to an entire string, or to a range within the string. The string represents each range with consistent attributes as a *run*.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString] uses subscripts and dynamic member lookup to simplify working with attributes from your call points. In its most verbose form, you set an attribute by creating an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeContainer] and merging it into an existing attributed string, like this:\n\nUsing the attributed string’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedStringProtocol\/subscript(_:)-4thnp] method, you can omit the explicit use of an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeContainer] and just set the attribute by its type:\n\nBecause an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString] supports dynamic member lookup — as described under [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/ReferenceManual\/Attributes.html] in [https:\/\/docs.swift.org\/swift-book\/] — you can access its subscripts with dot syntax instead. When combined with properties like [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeScopes\/AppKitAttributes\/foregroundColor] that return the attribute key type, this final form offers a natural way to set an attribute that applies to an entire string:\n\nThis example works because AppKit defines an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeScope], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeScopes\/AppKitAttributes], in which the property [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeScopes\/AppKitAttributes\/foregroundColor] returns the type `AttributeScopes.AppKitAttributes.ForegroundColorAttribute`. Because AppKit’s attribute scope implements [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeDynamicLookup], the dot syntax resolves to an equivalent subscript expression, allowing `attributedString.foregroundColor` to replace `attributedString[AttributeScopes.AppKitAttributes.ForegroundColorAttribute.self]`.\n\nYou can also set an attribute to apply only to part of an attributed string, by applying the attribute to a range, as seen here:\n\nYou can access portions of the string with unique combinations of attributes by iterating over the string’s `runs` property.\n\nYou can define your own custom attributes by creating types that conform to [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedStringKey], and collecting them in an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeScope]. Custom keys should also extend [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeDynamicLookup], so callers can use dot-syntax to access the attribute.\n\n### Creating Attributed Strings with Markdown\n\nYou can create an attributed string by passing a standard [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/String] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Data] instance that contains Markdown to initializers like [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString\/init(markdown:options:baseURL:)-52n3u]. The attributed string creates attributes by parsing the markup in the string.\n\nLocalized strings that you load from strings files with initializers like [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString\/init(localized:options:table:bundle:locale:comment:)-8dlnl] can also contain Markdown to add styling. In addition, these localized attributed string initializers can apply the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeScopes\/FoundationAttributes\/replacementIndex] attribute, which allows you to determine the range of replacement strings, whose order may vary between languages.\n\nBy declaring new attributes that conform to [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/MarkdownDecodableAttributedStringKey], you can add attributes that you invoke by using Apple’s Markdown extension syntax: `^[text](name:value, name:value, …)`. See the sample code project doc:building-a-localized-food-ordering-app for an example of creating custom attributes and using them with Markdown.\n\nLocalized attributed strings can also use the extension syntax to indicate parts of the string where the system can apply automatic grammar agreement. See the initializers that take a `localized:` parameter for examples of this extension syntax, as used with automatic grammar agreement.\n\n### Attribute Scopes\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedString] API defines keys for common uses, such as text styling, semantically marking up formattable types like dates and numbers, and hyperlinking. You can find these in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeScopes] enumeration, which contains attributes for AppKit, Foundation, SwiftUI, and UIKit.\n\nYou can define your own attributes by implementing [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributedStringKey], and reference them by name by collecting them in an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/AttributeScope].",
