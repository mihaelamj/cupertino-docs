Returns an empty array if no matching resource files are found.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf `subpath` is `nil`, this method searches the top-level non-localized resource directory and the top-level of any language-specific directories. (In macOS, the top-level non-localized resource directory is typically called `Resources` but in iOS, it is the main bundle directory.)\n\nFor example, suppose you have a Mac app with a modern bundle and you specify `@\"Documentation\"` for the `subpath` parameter. This method would first look in the `Contents\/Resources\/Documentation` directory of the bundle, followed by the `Documentation` subdirectories of each language-specific `.lproj` directory. (The search order for the language-specific directories corresponds to the user’s preferences.) This method does not recurse through any other subdirectories at any of these locations.
