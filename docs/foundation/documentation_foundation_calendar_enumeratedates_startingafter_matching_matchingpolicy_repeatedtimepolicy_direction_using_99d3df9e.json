The default value is `.forward`, which means later in time.\n- **block**: A closure that is called with search results.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThere will be at least one intervening date which does not match all the components (or the given date itself must not match) between the given date and any result.\n\nIf `direction` is set to `.backward`, this method finds the previous match before the given date. The intent is that the same matches as for a `.forward` search will be found (that is, if you are enumerating forwards or backwards for each hour with minute “27”, the seconds in the date you will get in forwards search would obviously be 00, and the same will be true in a backwards search in order to implement this rule.
