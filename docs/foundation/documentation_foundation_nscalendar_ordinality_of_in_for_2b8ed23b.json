Returns `NSNotFound` if `larger` is not logically bigger than `smaller` in the calendar, or the given combination of units does not make sense (or is a computation which is undefined).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe ordinality is in most cases not the same as the decomposed value of the unit. Typically return values are `1` and greater. For example, the time `00:45` is in the first hour of the day, and for units Hour and Day respectively, the result would be `1`. An exception is the week-in-month calculation, which returns `0` for days before the first week in the month containing the date.\n\nNote that some computations can take a relatively long time.",
