A bitmap representation may contain zero to sixteen additional 8192 byte segments to for each additional Unicode plane containing a character in a character set, with each 8192 byte segment prepended with a single plane index byte.\n\nTo add a character in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) with decimal Unicode value n to a raw bitmap representation, you might do the following:\n\nTo remove that character:",
