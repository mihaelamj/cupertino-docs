Instead of recompiling your code every time you want to make a change, your code uses settings to alter your app’s configuration dynamically. Typically, you use this kind of data to reflect the personal preferences of the person using your app. For example, a drawing app might store whether someone prefers inches or centimeters for distance measurements. However, you can also use settings to manage internal behaviors, such as the amount of data your app logs during testing.\n\nThe system stores each app’s settings persistently to disk, so that they are available between launches.

The  [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UserDefaults] type manages settings for your app on the current device, and doesn’t share those settings with the person’s other devices.
