Use the shared session to fetch the contents of a URL to memory with just a few lines of code.\n\nUnlike the other session types, you don’t create the shared session; you merely access it by using this property directly. As a result, you don’t provide a delegate or a configuration object.\n\n### Limitations of the shared session\n\nBecause the shared session has neither a delegate nor a customizable configuration object, the shared session has important limitations:\n\nThe shared session uses the shared [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLCache], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/HTTPCookieStorage], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLCredentialStorage] objects, uses a shared custom networking protocol list (configured with [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLProtocol\/registerClass(_:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLProtocol\/unregisterClass(_:)]), and is based on a default configuration.\n\nIn general, when working with a shared session, you should avoid customizing the cache, cookie storage, or credential storage (unless you are already doing so with [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnection]). There’s a good chance that you’ll outgrow the capabilities of the default session, at which point you’ll have to rewrite all of those customizations to work with your custom URL sessions.\n\nIn other words, if you’re doing *anything* with caches, cookies, authentication, or custom networking protocols, you should probably be using a default session instead of the shared session.",
