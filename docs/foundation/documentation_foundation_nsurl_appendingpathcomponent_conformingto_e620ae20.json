  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA new URL with the partial name and the type’s preferred extension appended.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when you want to mix partial input from a user or other source, and need to produce a complete filename suitable for that input. For example, if you download a file from the internet and know its MIME type, you can use this method to ensure the URL has the correct filename extension where you save the file.\n\nIf `partialName` already has a path extension, and that path extension is valid for file system objects of type `contentType`, the function doesn’t add an extension before appending it to the URL. For example, if the inputs are `puppy.jpg` and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UniformTypeIdentifiers\/UTType-swift.struct\/image], respectively, the function returns a URL with an appended path component of `puppy.jpg`. However, if the inputs are `puppy.jpg` and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UniformTypeIdentifiers\/UTType-swift.struct\/plainText], respectively, the function returns a URL with an appended path component of `puppy.jpg.txt`. If you want to replace any existing path extension, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL\/deletePathExtension()] method first.\n\nIf the function can’t append the path component, it returns an unchanged URL.\n\nFor more information about types, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UniformTypeIdentifiers].",
