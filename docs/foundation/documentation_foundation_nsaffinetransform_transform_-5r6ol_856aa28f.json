You can think of this method as transforming a vector whose origin is (0, 0) and whose end point is specified by the value in `aSize`. After the rotation and scaling factors are applied, this method effectively returns the end point of the new vector.\n\nThis method is useful for transforming delta or distance values when you need to take scaling and rotation factors into account.",
