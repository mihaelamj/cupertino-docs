For example, the U.S. English (`en-US`) locale specifies that names be displayed in “given name followed by the family name” (for example,“John Appleseed”). This behavior would be overridden if the user changed their system preferences to have names displayed as family name followed by given name (for example, “Appleseed, John”), because user-specified preferences take precedence over locale-derived defaults. Furthermore, if the name to be formatted were Japanese (for example, given name: “泰夫”, family name: “木田”), the behavior derived for the name’s script (CJK, for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages) would take precedence over any locale-derived defaults or user-specified preferences to have the name displayed as family name followed by given name (for example, “木田 泰夫”).\n\nThese considerations extend to the availability of certain formatter styles as well.

These rules vary widely across different locales in a several ways, including the sort and display order of given and family names, the use of salutations and honorifics, and other concerns related to the grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting. About the only thing that *is* consistent across all locales is that personal names are significant and meaningful. For this reason, names deserve careful and respectful treatment—perhaps more than any other kind of information your app interacts with.\n\nFormatters can be configured to represent names in a variety of styles, which are described in detail below.\n\n- Default ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/PersonNameComponentsFormatter\/Style-swift.enum\/default])\n- Short ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/PersonNameComponentsFormatter\/Style-swift.enum\/short])\n- Long ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/PersonNameComponentsFormatter\/Style-swift.enum\/long])\n- Abbreviated ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/PersonNameComponentsFormatter\/Style-swift.enum\/abbreviated])\n\nWhen determining how to represent a name in a particular style, a formatter takes a number of factors into consideration, in order of priority:\n\n1. **Script derived behaviors** Scripts may specify a strict sort or display order of given and family names, and the availability of styles.\n2. **User specified preferences** Users can enable and configure the display of short names, as well as whether or not to display nicknames when available. Users can also override the default sort and display order of given and family names for their current locale.\n3. **Locale derived defaults** Locales specify a default sort and display order for given and family names.\n4. **Developer specified configuration** The style property value set for the `NSPersonNameComponentsFormatter` object.\n\nWhen the behavior specified in one factor conflicts with any other factors, the behavior specified by the factor with the most precedence is used.

If `familyName` is too long, or if the family name is `nil`, the Short or Medium style may be used instead.\n- For names in Korean script, `givenName` may be used. If `givenName` is too long, the first character of `givenName` may be used. If `givenName` is `nil`, the `familyName` may be used instead.\n- For names in Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Sinhala, Tamil, Telugu, Tibetan, or Thai script, the first character of `givenName` may be used. If `givenName` is `nil`, the first character of `familyName` may be used instead.\n- For names that contain more than one script, the abbreviated style may use the `familyName`, `givenName`, or the first characters of `givenName` and\/or `familyName`.\n\nIf the Abbreviated style is unavailable, the Short style is used instead—unless that too is unsupported, in which case the Medium style is used instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Configuring Formatter Behavior\n\n- **style**: The formatting style of the receiver.\n- **isPhonetic**: A Boolean value that specifies whether the receiver should use only the phonetic representations of name components.\n\n## Converting Between Person Name Components and Strings\n\n- **localizedString(from:style:options:)**: Returns a string formatted for a given `NSPersonNameComponents` object using the provided style and options.\n- **string(from:)**: Returns a string formatted for a given `NSPersonNameComponents` object.\n- **annotatedString(from:)**: Returns an attributed string formatted for a given `NSPersonNameComponents` object, with attribute annotations for each component.\n- **personNameComponents(from:)**: Returns a person name components object from a given string.\n- **getObjectValue(_:for:errorDescription:)**: Returns by reference a person name components object after creating it from a given string.\n\n## Constants\n\n- **PersonNameComponentsFormatter.Style**\n- **PersonNameComponentsFormatter.Options**\n- **Attributed String Key**: This constant is used as a key for person name component attributes in attributed strings returned by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/PersonNameComponentsFormatter\/annotatedString(from:)] method\n- **Attributed String Components**: These constants are used to identify individual components of attributed strings returned by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/PersonNameComponentsFormatter\/annotatedString(from:)] method.\n- **Component Delimiter**: This constant defines the delimiter used to separate name components.\n\n## Instance Properties\n\n- **locale**\n\n## Names\n\n- **PersonNameComponents**: The separate parts of a person’s name, allowing locale-aware formatting.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- Formatter\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSCoding\n- NSCopying\n- NSObjectProtocol\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
