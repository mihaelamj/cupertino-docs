A bitmap representation may contain zero to sixteen additional 8192 byte segments to for each additional Unicode plane containing a character in a character set, with each 8192 byte segment prepended with a single plane index byte.\n\nFor example, a character set containing only Basic Latin (ASCII) characters, which are contained by the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP, plane 0), has a bitmap representation with a size of 8192 bytes, whereas a character set containing both Basic Latin (ASCII) characters and emoji characters, which are contained by the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP, plane 1), has a bitmap representation with a size of 16385 bytes (8192 bytes for BMP, followed by the byte `0x01` for the plane index of SMP, followed by 8192 bytes for SMP).\n\nTo test for the presence of a character in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) with decimal Unicode value n in a raw bitmap representation, you might do the following:",
