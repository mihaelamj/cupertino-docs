Returns the actual object represented by the nested series of object specifiers. Returns `nil` if a container specifier could not be evaluated or if no top-level container specifier could be found. Thus `nil` can be a valid value or can indicate an error; you can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSScriptObjectSpecifier\/evaluationErrorNumber] to determine if and which error occurred and [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSScriptObjectSpecifier\/evaluationError] to find the container specifier responsible for the error.
