Most applications don’t need to subclass `NSCreateCommand` or invoke its methods.\n\nWhen an instance of `NSCreateCommand` is executed, it creates a new object using `[[theClassToBeCreated allocWithZone:NULL] init]` (where `theClassToBeCreated` is the class of the object to be created), unless the command has a `with data` argument. In the latter case, the new object is created by invoking `[[NSScriptCoercionHandler sharedCoercionHandler] coerceValue:theDataAsAnObject toClass:theClassToBeCreated]`.  Any properties specified by a `with properties` argument are then set in the new object using `-setScriptingProperties:`.\n\nIf an `NSCreateCommand` object with no argument corresponding to the `at` parameter is executed (for example, `tell application \"Mail\" to make new mailbox with properties {name:\"testFolder\"}`), and the receiver of the command (not necessarily the application object) has a to-many relationship to objects of the class to be instantiated, and the class description for the receiving class returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] when sent an `isLocationRequiredToCreateForKey:` message, the `NSCreateCommand` object creates a new object and sends the receiver an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class\/insertValue(_:at:inPropertyWithKey:)] message to place the new object in the container.
