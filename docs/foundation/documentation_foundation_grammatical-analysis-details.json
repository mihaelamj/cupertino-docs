If the `NSGrammarRange` key is not present in the dictionary it is assumed to be equal to the overall sentence range.\n- **NSGrammarUserDescription**: The value for the `NSGrammarUserDescription` dictionary key should be an `NSString` containing descriptive text about that range, to be presented directly to the user; it is intended that the user description should provide enough information to allow the user to correct the problem. It is recommended that `NSGrammarUserDescription` be supplied in all cases, however, `NSGrammarUserDescription` or `NSGrammarCorrections` must be supplied in order for correction guidance to be presented to the user.\n- **NSGrammarCorrections**: The value for the `NSGrammarCorrections` key should be an `NSArray` of `NSStrings` representing potential substitutions to correct the problem, but it is expected that this may not be available in all cases. `NSGrammarUserDescription` or `NSGrammarCorrections` must be supplied in order for correction guidance to be presented to the user.\n\n",
