If the host computer has access to multiple registration domains, you must create separate `NSNetService` objects for each domain. If you attempt to publish in a domain for which you do not have registration authority, your request may be denied.\n\nIt is acceptable to use an empty string for the `domain` argument when publishing or browsing a service, but do not rely on this for resolution.\n\nThis method is the designated initializer.",

To use the default registration domains, pass in an empty string (`@\"\"`). To limit registration to the local domain, use `@\"local.\"`.\n\nYou can also use a `NSNetServiceBrowser` object to obtain a list of possible domains in which you can publish your service.\n- **type**: The network service type.\n\n`type` must contain both the service type and transport layer information. To ensure that the mDNS responder searches for services, as opposed to hosts, prefix both the service name and transport layer name with an underscore character (”_”). For example, to search for an HTTP service on TCP, you would use the type string “`_http._tcp.`”. Note that the period character at the end of the string, which indicates that the domain name is an absolute name, is required.\n- **name**: The name by which the service is identified to the network. The name must be unique. If you pass the empty string (`@\"\"`), the system automatically advertises your service using the computer name as the service name.\n- **port**: The port on which the service is published.\n\nIf you specify the `NSNetServiceListenForConnections` flag, you may pass zero (`0`), in which case the service automatically allocates an arbitrary (ephemeral) port for your service. When the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetServiceDelegate\/netServiceDidPublish(_:)] is called, you can determine the actual port chosen by calling the service object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NetService] method or accessing the corresponding property.\n\nIf your app is listening for connections on its own, the value of `port` must be a port number acquired by your application for the service.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou use this method to create a service that you wish to publish on the network.
