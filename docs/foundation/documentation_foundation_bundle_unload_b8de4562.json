You may use this method to unload plug-in and framework bundles when you no longer need the code they contain. You should use this method to unload bundles that were loaded using the methods of the `NSBundle` class only. Do not use this method to unload bundles that were originally loaded using the bundle-manipulation functions in Core Foundation.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that no in-memory objects or data structures refer to the code being unloaded. For example, if you have an object whose class is defined in a bundle, you must release that object prior to unloading the bundle. Similarly, your code should not attempt to access any symbols defined in an unloaded bundle.\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nPrior to OS X version 10.5, code could not be unloaded once loaded, and this method would always return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false]. In macOS 10.5 and later, you can unload a bundle’s executable code using this method.",
