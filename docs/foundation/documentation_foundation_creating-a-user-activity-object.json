The system uses the information in that key to determine whether your app is capable of handling a given user activity object.\n\n### Define activities\n\nWhen defining a user activity object, do the following:\n\n1. Create and initialize the user activity object with an appropriate activity type. (You define the activity types your app supports.)\n2. Set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/title] of the user activity object.\n3. Configure the tasks for which the object is eligible by enabling one or more of the following properties: [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/isEligibleForHandoff], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/isEligibleForSearch], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/isEligibleForPublicIndexing].\n4. Configure the properties of this object that relate to a person’s current activity.\n5. For user activity objects configured for search or public indexing, configure the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/contentAttributeSet], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/keywords], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/webpageURL] properties so that Spotlight can index the object.\n6. Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/becomeCurrent()] method to register the user activity object with the system.\n\n### Associate activity identifiers with your apps\n\nThe system associates user activity objects from your app with your developer Team ID. When continuing an activity, the system looks for an app that supports the given activity type and has the same developer Team ID as the activity’s source app. Tying activity objects to your developer Team ID ensures that a competitor’s app can’t intercept the activities you create. To associate your Team ID with your apps, distribute your apps through the App Store or sign them with your developer ID.\n\n## Creating a user activity object\n\n- **init(activityType:)**: Creates a user activity object with the specified type.\n- **init()**: Creates a user activity object using the first activity type declared in the app’s information property list file.\n\n",
