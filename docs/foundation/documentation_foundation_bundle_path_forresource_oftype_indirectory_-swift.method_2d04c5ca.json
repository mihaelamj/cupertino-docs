(In macOS, the top-level nonlocalized resource directory is typically called `Resources` but in iOS, it is the main bundle directory.) For example, suppose you have a Mac app with a modern bundle and you specify `@\"Documentation\"` for the `subpath` parameter. This method would first look in the `Contents\/Resources\/Documentation` directory of the bundle, followed by the `Documentation` subdirectories of each language-specific `.lproj` directory.\n\nWhether this method recurses through subdirectories is dependent on the `extension` parameter. If `nil` or an empty string it will recurse, otherwise, it does not. (The search order for the language-specific directories corresponds to the user’s preferences.)
