The notification includes a `userInfo` dictionary with the created `NSFileHandle` object, which is accessible using the `NSFileHandleNotificationFileHandleItem` key.\n\nYou must call this method from a thread that has an active run loop.\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nThe receiver must be created by an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileHandle\/init(fileDescriptor:)] message that takes as an argument a stream-type socket created by the appropriate system routine, *and that is being listened on*. In other words, you must `bind()` the socket, and ensure that the socket has a connection backlog defined by `listen()`.\n\nThe object that will write data to the returned file handle must add itself as an observer of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNotification\/Name-swift.struct\/NSFileHandleConnectionAccepted].\n\nNote that this method does not continue to listen for connection requests after it posts [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNotification\/Name-swift.struct\/NSFileHandleConnectionAccepted].
