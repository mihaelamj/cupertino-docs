Specify `nil` if you don’t want the elements formatted.\n- **level**: A level of indent, to make the output more readable: set `level` to `0` to use four spaces to indent, or `1` to indent the output with a tab character.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA string that represents the contents of the array, formatted as a property list.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe returned `NSString` object contains the string representations of each of the array’s elements, in order, from first to last. To obtain the string representation of a given element, [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSArray\/description(withLocale:indent:)] proceeds as follows:\n\n- If the element is an `NSString` object, it is used as is.\n- If the element responds to [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSArray\/description(withLocale:indent:)], that method is invoked to obtain the element’s string representation.\n- If the element responds to [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSArray\/description(withLocale:)], that method is invoked to obtain the element’s string representation.\n- If none of the above conditions is met, the element’s string representation is obtained by invoking its [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSArray\/description] method.\n\n## Creating a Description\n\n- **description**: A string that represents the contents of the array, formatted as a property list.\n- **description(withLocale:)**: Returns a string that represents the contents of the array, formatted as a property list.\n\n",
