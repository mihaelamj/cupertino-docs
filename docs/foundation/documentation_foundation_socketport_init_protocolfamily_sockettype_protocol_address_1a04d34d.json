Possible values are defined in `<sys\/socket.h>`, such as `AF_LOCAL`, `AF_INET`, and `AF_INET6`.\n- **type**: The type of socket.\n- **protocol**: The specific protocol to use from the protocol family.\n- **address**: The family-specific socket address for the receiver copied into an `NSData` object.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA local socket port initialized with the provided arguments.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe receiver must be added to a run loop before it can accept connections or receive messages.
