When a notification with this suspension behavior is matched, it has the effect of first flushing any queued notifications. The effect is as if [`suspended`](\/documentation\/foundation\/distributednotificationcenter\/suspended) with an argument of [`false`](\/documentation\/Swift\/false) were first called if the application is suspended, followed by the notification in question being delivered, followed by a transition back to the previous suspended or unsuspended state.\n\n## [See Also](\/documentation\/Foundation\/DistributedNotificationCenter\/SuspensionBehavior\/deliverImmediately#see-also)\n\n### [Constants](\/documentation\/Foundation\/DistributedNotificationCenter\/SuspensionBehavior\/deliverImmediately#Constants)\n\n[`case drop`](\/documentation\/foundation\/distributednotificationcenter\/suspensionbehavior\/drop)The server doesn’t queue any notifications with this name and object until the notification center resumes notification delivery.[`case coalesce`](\/documentation\/foundation\/distributednotificationcenter\/suspensionbehavior\/coalesce)The server only queues the last notification of the specified name and object; earlier notifications are dropped.
