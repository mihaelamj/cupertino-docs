You specify the name of the object that’s changing (or the owner of that object) and provide a closure, method, or invocation to revert its state.\n\nAfter you register an undo operation, you can call [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UndoManager\/undo()] on the undo manager to revert to the state of the last undo operation. When undoing an action, [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UndoManager] saves the operations you revert to so that you can call [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UndoManager\/redo()] automatically.\n\nTypically, apps with UI interactions work with [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UndoManager]. For example, UIKit implements undo and redo in its text view object, making it easy for you to undo and redo actions in objects along the responder chain. [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UndoManager] also serves as a general-purpose state manager, which you can use to undo and redo many kinds of actions. For example, an interactive command-line utility can use this class to undo the last command run, or a networking library can undo a request by sending another request that invalidates the previous one.\n\n\n\n## Registering undo operations\n\n- **registerUndo(withTarget:handler:)**: Registers the specified closure to implement a single undo operation that the target receives.\n- **registerUndo(withTarget:selector:object:)**: Registers the selector of the specified target to implement a single undo operation that the target receives.\n- **prepare(withInvocationTarget:)**: Prepares the undo manager for invocation-based undo with the given target as the subject of the next undo operation.\n\n## Checking undo ability\n\n- **canUndo**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the manager has any actions to undo.\n- **canRedo**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the manager has any actions to redo.\n\n## Performing undo and redo\n\n- **undo()**: Closes the top-level undo group if necessary, and then performs undo operations on the group.\n- **undoNestedGroup()**: Performs the undo operations in the last undo group (whether top-level or nested), recording the operations on the redo stack as a single group.\n- **redo()**: Performs the operations in the last group on the redo stack, if there are any, recording them on the undo stack as a single group.\n\n## Managing undo and redo stack depth\n\n- **levelsOfUndo**: The maximum number of top-level undo groups the undo manager holds.\n- **undoCount**: The number of times you can invoke undo before there are no actions left to undo.\n- **redoCount**: The number of times you can invoke redo before there are no actions left to redo.\n\n## Creating undo groups\n\n- **beginUndoGrouping()**: Marks the beginning of an undo group.\n- **endUndoGrouping()**: Marks the end of an undo group.\n- **groupsByEvent**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the manager automatically creates undo groups around each pass of the run loop.\n- **groupingLevel**: The number of nested undo groups (or redo groups, if redo is the most recent operation) in the current event loop.\n\n## Enabling and disabling undo\n\n- **disableUndoRegistration()**: Disables the recording of undo operations.\n- **enableUndoRegistration()**: Enables the recording of undo operations.\n- **isUndoRegistrationEnabled**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the recording of undo operations is enabled.\n\n## Checking whether undo or redo is in process\n\n- **isUndoing**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the manager is in the process of performing an undo action.\n- **isRedoing**: Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the manager is in the process of performing a redo action.\n\n## Clearing undo operations\n\n- **removeAllActions()**: Clears the undo and redo stacks and reenables the manager.\n- **removeAllActions(withTarget:)**: Clears the undo and redo stacks of all operations involving the specified target as the recipient of the undo message.\n\n## Managing the action name\n\n- **undoActionName**: The name identifying the undo action.\n- **redoActionName**: The name identifying the redo action.\n- **setActionName(_:)**: Sets the name of the action associated with the Undo or Redo command using a localized string resource.\n- **setActionName(_:)**: Sets the name of the action associated with the Undo or Redo command.\n\n## Getting and localizing the menu item title\n\n- **undoMenuItemTitle**: The title of the Undo menu command, such as Undo Paste.\n- **redoMenuItemTitle**: The title of the Redo menu command, such as Redo Paste.\n- **undoMenuTitle(forUndoActionName:)**: Returns the localized title of the Undo menu command for the identified action.\n- **redoMenuTitle(forUndoActionName:)**: Returns the localized title of the Redo menu command for the identified action.\n\n## Working with user info\n\n- **setActionUserInfoValue(_:forKey:)**: Sets a user info value for an undo or redo action.\n- **undoActionUserInfoValue(forKey:)**: Retrieves the undo action’s user info value for the given key.\n- **redoActionUserInfoValue(forKey:)**: Retrieves the redo action’s user info value for the given key.\n- **UndoManager.UserInfoKey**: An extensible namespace for undo and redo user info keys.\n\n## Working with run loops\n\n- **runLoopModes**: The modes governing the types of input to handle during a cycle of the run loop.\n- **NSUndoCloseGroupingRunLoopOrdering**: A priority to use when using a run loop to close an undo group.\n\n## Using discardable undo and redo actions\n\n- **setActionIsDiscardable(_:)**: Sets whether the next undo or redo action is discardable.\n- **undoActionIsDiscardable**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the next undo action is discardable.\n- **redoActionIsDiscardable**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the next redo action is discardable.\n\n## Working with notifications\n\n- **NSUndoManagerWillUndoChange**: Posted just before an undo manager performs an undo operation.\n- **NSUndoManagerDidUndoChange**: Posted just after an undo manager performs an undo operation.\n- **NSUndoManagerWillRedoChange**: Posted just before an undo manager performs a redo operation.\n- **NSUndoManagerDidRedoChange**: Posted just after an undo manager performs a redo operation.\n- **NSUndoManagerCheckpoint**: Posted whenever an undo manager opens or closes an undo group (except when it opens a top-level group) and when checking the redo stack.\n- **NSUndoManagerDidOpenUndoGroup**: Posted whenever an undo manager opens an undo group.\n- **NSUndoManagerWillCloseUndoGroup**: Posted before an undo manager closes an undo group.\n- **NSUndoManagerDidCloseUndoGroup**: Posted after an undo manager closes an undo group.\n- **NSUndoManagerGroupIsDiscardableKey**: A key, used in a notification’s user info, that indicates the undo group contains only discardable actions.\n\n## Working with notification messages\n\n- **UndoManager.WillUndoChangeMessage**: A message that an undo manager sends before undoing a change.\n- **UndoManager.DidUndoChangeMessage**: A message that an undo manager sends after undoing a change.\n- **UndoManager.WillRedoChangeMessage**: A message that an undo manager sends before redoing a change.\n- **UndoManager.DidRedoChangeMessage**: A message that an undo manager sends after redoing a change.\n- **UndoManager.CheckpointMessage**: A message that an undo manager sends at certain checkpoints.\n- **UndoManager.DidOpenUndoGroupMessage**: A message that an undo manager sends after opening an undo group.\n- **UndoManager.WillCloseUndoGroupMessage**: A message that an undo manager sends before closing an undo group.\n- **UndoManager.DidCloseUndoGroupMessage**: A message that an undo manager sends after closing an undo group.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSObjectProtocol\n- Sendable\n\n",
