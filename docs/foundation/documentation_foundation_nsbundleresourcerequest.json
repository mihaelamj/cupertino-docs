The managed resources are loaded into the main bundle.\n- **init(tags:bundle:)**: Initializes a resource request for managing the on-demand resources marked with any of the set of specified tags. The managed resources are loaded into the specified bundle.\n\n## Accessing the Configuration\n\n- **bundle**: A reference to the bundle used for storing the downloaded resources. (read-only)\n- **tags**: A set of strings, with each string specifying a tag used to mark on-demand resources managed by the request. (read-only)\n\n## Requesting Resources\n\n- **beginAccessingResources(completionHandler:)**: Requests access to the resources marked with the managed tags. If any of the resources are not on the device, they are requested from the App Store.\n- **conditionallyBeginAccessingResources(completionHandler:)**: Checks whether the resources marked with the tags managed by the request are already on the device. If all of the resources are on the device, you can begin accessing those resources.\n- **endAccessingResources()**: Informs the system that you have finished accessing the resources marked with the tags managed by the request.\n\n## Setting the Download Priority\n\n- **loadingPriority**: A hint to the system of the relative priority of the resource request.\n- **NSBundleResourceRequestLoadingPriorityUrgent**\n\n## Tracking Progress\n\n- **progress**: A reference to the progress object associated with the specified resource request. (read-only)\n\n## Errors\n\n- **NSBundleErrorMaximum**: The end of the range of error codes reserved for bundle errors.\n- **NSBundleErrorMinimum**: The start of the range of error codes reserved for bundle errors.\n- **NSBundleOnDemandResourceExceededMaximumSizeError**: The application exceeded the amount of on-demand resources content in use at one time.\n- **NSBundleOnDemandResourceInvalidTagError**: The application specified a tag that the system couldn’t find in the application tag manifest.\n- **NSBundleOnDemandResourceOutOfSpaceError**: Insufficient space available to download the requested on-demand resources.\n\n## Notifications\n\n- **NSBundleResourceRequestLowDiskSpace**: Posted after the system detects that the amount of available disk space is getting low. The notification is posted to the default notification center.\n\n## Structures\n\n- **NSBundleResourceRequest.LowDiskSpaceMessage**\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSObjectProtocol\n- ProgressReporting\n\n",
