The `request` object is deep-copied as part of the initialization process. Changes made to `request` after this method returns do not affect the request that is used for the loading process.\n- **delegate**: The delegate object for the connection. The connection calls methods on this delegate as the load progresses.\n- **startImmediately**: [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if the connection should begin loading data immediately, otherwise [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false]. If you pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], the connection is not scheduled with a run loop. You can then schedule the connection in the run loop and mode of your choice by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnection\/schedule(in:forMode:)].\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe URL connection for the URL request. Returns `nil` if a connection can’t be initialized.\n\n## Discussion\n\nDuring the download the connection maintains a strong reference to the `delegate`. It releases that strong reference when the connection finishes loading, fails, or is canceled.\n\n## Loading Data Asynchronously\n\n- **init(request:delegate:)**: Returns an initialized URL connection and begins to load the data for the URL request.\n- **sendAsynchronousRequest(_:queue:completionHandler:)**: Loads the data for a URL request and executes a handler block on an operation queue when the request completes or fails.\n- **start()**: Causes the connection to begin loading data, if it has not already.\n\n",
