For example, you might use this method to determine if the specified item is in the user’s `Documents` directory or is in the trash. If the relationship between the items is determined successfully, this method sets the value of the `outRelationship` parameter to an appropriate value. The directory may contain the item, it may be the same as the item, or it may not have a direct relationship to the item.",

For a list of possible values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/SearchPathDirectory].\n- **domainMask**: The file system domain to search. Specify `0` for this parameter if you want the file manager to choose the domain that is most appropriate for the specified `url`.\n- **url**: The URL of the file or directory whose relationship to `directoryURL` is being tested. This parameter must not be `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to determine the relationship between an item and one of the system-specific directories.
