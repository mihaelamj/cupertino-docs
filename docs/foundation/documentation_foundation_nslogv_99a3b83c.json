If you want to direct output elsewhere, you need to use a custom logging facility.\n\nThe message consists of a timestamp and the process ID prefixed to the string you pass in. You compose this string with a format string, `format`, and one or more arguments to be inserted into the string. The format specification allowed by these functions is that which is understood by `NSString`’s formatting capabilities (which is not necessarily the set of format escapes and flags understood by `printf`). The supported format specifiers are described in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/Conceptual\/CFStrings\/formatSpecifiers.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40004265]. A final hard return is added to the error message if one is not present in the format.\n\nIn general, you should use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSLog] function instead of calling this function directly. If you do use this function directly, you must have prepared the variable argument list in the `args` argument by calling the standard C macro `va_start`. Upon completion, you must similarly call the standard C macro `va_end` for this list.\n\nOutput from `NSLogv` is serialized, in that only one thread in a process can be doing the writing\/logging described above at a time.
