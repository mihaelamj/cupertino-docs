If the write is not completed within the specified interval, the write is canceled and the `completionHandler` is called with an error. Pass `0` to prevent a write from timing out.\n- **completionHandler**: The completion handler to call when all bytes are written, or an error occurs. This handler is executed on the delegate queue.\n\nThis completion handler takes the following parameter:\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThere is no guarantee that the remote side of the stream has received all of the written bytes at the time that `completionHandler` is called, only that all of the data has been written to the kernel.\n\n## Reading and writing data\n\n- **readData(ofMinLength:maxLength:timeout:completionHandler:)**: Asynchronously reads a number of bytes from the stream, and calls a handler upon completion.\n\n",
