Default value is `.nextTime`.\n- **repeatedTimePolicy**: Specifies the behavior when multiple matches are found. Default value is `.first`.\n- **direction**: Specifies the direction in time to search. Default is `.forward`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA `Date` representing the result of the search, or `nil` if a result could not be found.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf no such time exists, the next available time is returned (which could, for example, be in a different day than the nominal target date). The intent is to return a date on the same day as the original date argument.  This may result in a date which is backward than the given date, of course.\n\n## Calculating Dates from Components\n\n- **date(from:)**: Returns a date created from the specified components.\n- **date(byAdding:to:wrappingComponents:)**: Returns a new `Date` representing the date calculated by adding components to a given date.\n- **date(byAdding:value:to:wrappingComponents:)**: Returns a new `Date` representing the date calculated by adding an amount of a specific component to a given date.\n- **date(bySetting:value:of:)**: Returns a new `Date` representing the date calculated by setting a specific component to a given time, and trying to keep lower components the same.  If the component already has that value, this may result in a date which is the same as the given date.\n\n",
