This defaults to the table in `Localizable.strings` when `tableName` is `nil` or an empty string.\n- **bundle**: The bundle containing the table’s strings file. The main bundle is used if one isn’t specified.\n- **value**: The localized string for the development locale. For other locales, return this value if `key` isn’t found in the table.\n- **comment**: The comment to place above the key-value pair in the strings file. This parameter provides the translator with some context about the localized string’s presentation to the user.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe result of sending [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle\/localizedString(forKey:value:table:)] to `bundle`, passing the specified `key`, `value`, and `tableName`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this function to automatically generate a strings files named `[tableName].strings` located in `bundle` from your code when exporting localizations from Xcode or the `genstrings` utility.\n\nFor information about inserting plural nouns and units into localized strings, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/localizing-strings-that-contain-plurals].\n\n\n\n### Choose Meaningful Keys\n\nWords can often have multiple different meanings depending on the context in which they’re used.
