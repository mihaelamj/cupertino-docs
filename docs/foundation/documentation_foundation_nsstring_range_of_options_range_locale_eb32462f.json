The following options may be specified by combining them with the C bitwise `OR` operator: `NSCaseInsensitiveSearch`, `NSLiteralSearch`, `NSBackwardsSearch`, and `NSAnchoredSearch`. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/Strings\/introStrings.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/10000035i] for details on these options.\n- **rangeOfReceiverToSearch**: The range within the receiver for which to search for `aString`.\n\nRaises an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSExceptionName\/rangeException] if `aRange` is invalid.\n- **locale**: The locale to use when comparing the receiver with `aString`. To use the current locale, pass [[doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSLocale] [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSLocale\/current]]. To use the system locale, pass `nil`.\n\nThe locale argument affects the equality checking algorithm. For example, for the Turkish locale, case-insensitive compare matches “I” to “ı” (`U+0131 LATIN SMALL DOTLESS I`), not the normal “i” character.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSRange-c.struct] structure giving the location and length in the receiver of `aString` within `aRange` in the receiver, modulo the options in `mask`. The range returned is relative to the start of the string, not to the passed-in range. Returns `{``NSNotFound``, 0}` if `aString` is not found or is empty (`\"\"`).\n\n## Discussion\n\n`NSString` objects are compared by checking the Unicode canonical equivalence of their code point sequences.  The length of the returned range and that of `aString` may differ if equivalent composed character sequences are matched.\n\n\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nThis method detects all invalid ranges (including those with negative lengths). For applications linked against macOS 10.6 and later, this error causes an exception; for applications linked against earlier releases, this error causes a warning, which is displayed just once per application execution.\n\n## Finding Characters and Substrings\n\n- **contains(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the string contains a given string by performing a case-sensitive, locale-unaware search.\n- **localizedCaseInsensitiveContains(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the string contains a given string by performing a case-insensitive, locale-aware search.\n- **localizedStandardContains(_:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the string contains a given string by performing a case and diacritic insensitive, locale-aware search.\n- **rangeOfCharacter(from:)**: Finds and returns the range in the string of the first character from a given character set.\n- **rangeOfCharacter(from:options:)**: Finds and returns the range in the string of the first character, using given options, from a given character set.\n- **rangeOfCharacter(from:options:range:)**: Finds and returns the range in the string of the first character from a given character set found in a given range with given options.\n- **range(of:)**: Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given string within the string.\n- **range(of:options:)**: Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given string within the string, subject to given options.\n- **range(of:options:range:)**: Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given string, within the given range of the string, subject to given options.\n- **localizedStandardRange(of:)**: Finds and returns the range of the first occurrence of a given string within the string by performing a case and diacritic insensitive, locale-aware search.\n- **enumerateLines(_:)**: Enumerates all the lines in the string.\n- **enumerateSubstrings(in:options:using:)**: Enumerates the substrings of the specified type in the specified range of the string.\n\n",
