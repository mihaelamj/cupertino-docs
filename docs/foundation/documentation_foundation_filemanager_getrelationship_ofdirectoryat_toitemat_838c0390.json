The directory may contain the item, it may be the same as the item, or it may not have a direct relationship to the item.",

For a list of possible values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/URLRelationship].\n- **directoryURL**: The URL of the directory that potentially contains the item in `otherURL`. The URL in this parameter must specify a directory. This parameter must not be `nil`.\n- **otherURL**: The URL of the file or directory whose relationship to `directoryURL` is being tested. This parameter must not be `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to determine the relationship between an item and a directory whose location you already know. If the relationship between the items is determined successfully, this method sets the value of the `outRelationship` parameter to an appropriate value. The directory may contain the item, it may be the same as the item, or it may not have a direct relationship to the item.\n\n\n\n## Getting the relationship between items\n\n- **getRelationship(_:of:in:toItemAt:)**: Determines the type of relationship that exists between a system directory and the specified item.\n- **FileManager.URLRelationship**: Constants indicating the relationship between a directory and an item.\n\n",
