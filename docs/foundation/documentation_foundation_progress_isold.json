Sometimes you need to implement *edge-triggered* behavior, in which you do something either exactly when new progress begins or not at all.\n\nIn the example above, the Dock doesn’t animate file icons when this method returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true].\n\nThere’s no reliable definition of *before* in this case, which involves multiple processes in a preemptively scheduled system. Don’t use this method for anything more important than best efforts at animating. It can be inaccurate due to processes coming and going from unpredictable user actions.",
