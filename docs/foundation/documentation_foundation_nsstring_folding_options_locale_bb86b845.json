  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA string created by performing a character folding operation with the specified options and locale.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen working with text—especially text in Latin script—it’s often useful to compare strings in such a way that ignores differences in case (uppercase or lowercase), width (full-width or half-width), and\/or diacritics (accents and other marks).\n\nTo accomplish this, you may use one of the methods described in Identifying and Comparing Strings, passing one or more options specified by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString\/CompareOptions] type as appropriate. If you’re performing many such comparisons, you may instead, as an optimization, perform a single folding operation on the string and store the result, passing that into a more efficient comparison method. For example, if you were determining the case-insensitive (that is, “HELLO”, “hello”, and “Hello” are all considered equal) intersection of two sets of strings, instead of calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString\/localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare(_:)] method for each pair of strings, you might first normalize both sets of strings by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString\/folding(options:locale:)] method, passing the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString\/CompareOptions\/caseInsensitive] option and the current locale, and then compare each pair of folded strings using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString\/isEqual(to:)] method.\n\nRules for how characters are folded may vary, depending on the locale. For example, when folding a string containing the character “I” (`U+0049` `LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I`) and specifying the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString\/CompareOptions\/caseInsensitive] comparison option, an English-speaking locale returns “i” (`U+0069` `LATIN SMALL LETTER I`), and a Turkish-speaking locale returns “ı” (`U+0131 LATIN SMALL DOTLESS I`).",
