For example, a user browsing an article in Safari on a Mac can move to an iOS device where the same webpage automatically opens in Safari with the same scroll position.\n\nThe user activity delegate is responsible for updating the state of an activity and is also notified when an activity has been continued on another device. The user activity delegate is typically a top-level object in the app—such as a window, view controller, or the app delegate—that manages the activity’s interaction with the app.",
