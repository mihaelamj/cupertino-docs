The reason for this, of course, is that `NSNumberFormatter` doesn’t perform currency conversions, it just formats numeric data. You wouldn’t want one user interpreting the value `\"56324\"` as US currency and another user who’s accessing the same data interpreting it as Japanese currency, simply based on each user’s localization preferences.",
