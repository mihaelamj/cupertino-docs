In a managed memory environment, this is instead of the `retain` message the object would otherwise receive. The object copy is then added to the returned set.\n\nIf [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], then in a managed memory environment each object in `set` simply receives a `retain` message when it is added to the returned set.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn initialized set that contains the members of `set`.
