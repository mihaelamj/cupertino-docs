The first time you call this method for a given ubiquity container, the system extends your app’s sandbox to include that container. In iOS, you must call this method at least once before trying to search for cloud-based files in the ubiquity container. If your app accesses multiple ubiquity containers, call this method once for each container. In macOS, you do not need to call this method if you use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSDocument]-based objects, because the system then calls this method automatically.\n\nYou can use the URL returned by this method to build paths to files and directories within your app’s ubiquity container. Each app that syncs documents to the cloud must have at least one associated ubiquity container in which to put those files. This container can be unique to the app or shared by multiple apps.\n\nIn addition to writing to its own ubiquity container, an app can write to any container directory for which it has the appropriate permission. Each additional ubiquity container should be listed as an additional value in the `com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers` entitlement array.\n\nTo learn how to view your development team’s unique *<TEAM_ID>* value, read To view the team ID in Tools Workflow Guide for Mac.",
