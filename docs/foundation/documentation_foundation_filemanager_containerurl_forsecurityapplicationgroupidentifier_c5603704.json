The behavior of application groups differs between macOS and iOS.\n\n### App Groups in macOS\n\nFor a sandboxed app in macOS, the group directory is located at `~\/Library\/Group Containers\/<application-group-id>`, where the application group identifier begins with the developer’s team identifier followed by a dot, followed by the specific group name. The system creates this directory automatically the first time your app needs it and never removes it.\n\nThe system also creates the `Library\/Application Support`, `Library\/Caches`, and `Library\/Preferences` subdirectories inside the group directory the first time you use it. You are free to add or remove subdirectories as you see fit, but you are encouraged to use these standardized locations as you would in the app’s usual container.\n\nIf you call the method with an invalid group identifier, namely one for which you do not have an entitlement, the method still returns a URL of the expected form, but the corresponding group directory does not actually exist, nor can your sandboxed app create it. Therefore be sure to test that you can successfully access the returned URL before using it.\n\n### App Groups in iOS\n\nIn iOS, the group identifier starts with the word `group` and a dot, followed by the group name. However, the system makes no guarantee about the group directory’s name or location in the file system. Indeed, the directory is accessible only with the file URL returned by this method. As in macOS, the system creates the directory when you need it. Unlike in macOS, when all the apps in a given app group are removed from the device, the system detects this condition and removes the corresponding group directory as well.\n\nThe system creates only the `Library\/Caches` subdirectory automatically, but you can create others yourself if you need them. You are free to use the group directory as you see fit, but take care to coordinate its structure among all the group’s apps.\n\nIf you call the method with an invalid group identifier in iOS, the method returns a `nil` value.",
