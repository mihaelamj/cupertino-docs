Setting this property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] prevents the queue from starting any queued operations, but already executing operations continue to execute. You may continue to add operations to a queue that is suspended but those operations are not scheduled for execution until you change this property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false].\n\nOperations are removed from the queue only when they finish executing. However, in order to finish executing, an operation must first be started. Because a suspended queue does not start any new operations, it does not remove any operations (including cancelled operations) that are currently queued and not executing.\n\nYou may monitor changes to the value of this property using [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/DevPedia-CocoaCore\/KVO.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008195-CH16].
