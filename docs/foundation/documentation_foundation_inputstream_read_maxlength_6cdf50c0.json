The buffer must be large enough to contain the number of bytes specified by `len`.\n- **len**: The maximum number of bytes to read.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA number indicating the outcome of the operation:\n\n## Discussion\n\n- A positive number indicates the number of bytes read.\n- `0` indicates that the end of the buffer was reached.\n- `-1` means that the operation failed; more information about the error can be obtained with [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Stream\/streamError].\n\n## Using Streams\n\n- **getBuffer(_:length:)**: Returns by reference a pointer to a read buffer and, by reference, the number of bytes available, and returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the buffer is available.\n- **hasBytesAvailable**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver has bytes available to read.\n\n",
