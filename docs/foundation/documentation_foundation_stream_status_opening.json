For network streams, this status might include the time after the stream was opened, but while network DNS resolution is happening.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\ncase opening\n```\n\n## Enumeration Cases\n\n- **Stream.Status.atEnd**: There is no more data to read, or no more data can be written to the stream. When this status is returned, the stream is in a “non-blocking” mode and no data are available.\n- **Stream.Status.closed**: The stream is closed ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Stream\/close()] has been called on it).\n- **Stream.Status.error**: The remote end of the connection can’t be contacted, or the connection has been severed for some other reason.\n- **Stream.Status.notOpen**: The stream is not open for reading or writing. This status is returned before the underlying call to open a stream but after it’s been created.\n- **Stream.Status.open**: The stream is open, but no reading or writing is occurring.\n- **Stream.Status.reading**: Data is being read from the stream. This status would be returned if code on another thread were to call [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Stream\/streamStatus] on the stream while a [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/InputStream\/read(_:maxLength:)] call ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/InputStream]) was in progress.\n- **Stream.Status.writing**: Data is being written to the stream. This status would be returned if code on another thread were to call [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Stream\/streamStatus] on the stream while a [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/OutputStream\/write(_:maxLength:)] call ([doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/OutputStream]) was in progress.\n\n",
