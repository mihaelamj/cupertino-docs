When your process is in the background, the method tries to take a task assertion to ensure that your block has time to execute. If it is unable to take a task assertion, or if the time allotted for the task assertion expires, the system executes your block with the parameter set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true]. If it is able to take the task assertion, it executes the block and passes [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] for the expired parameter.\n\nIf your block is still executing and the system need to suspend the process, the system executes your block a second time with the `expired` parameter set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true]. Your block must be prepared to handle this case. When the expired parameter is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], stop any in-progress tasks as quickly as possible.",
