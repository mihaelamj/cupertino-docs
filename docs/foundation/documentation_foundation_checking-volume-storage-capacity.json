To get the storage capacity of a volume, you construct a URL (using an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL])  that references an object on the volume to be queried, and then query that volume.\n\n### Decide Which Query Type to Use\n\nThe query type to use depends on what’s being stored. If you’re storing data based on a user request or resources the app requires to function properly (for example, a video the user is about to watch or resources that are needed for the next level in a game), query against [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLResourceKey\/volumeAvailableCapacityForImportantUsageKey]. However, if you’re downloading data in a more predictive manner (for example, downloading a newly available episode of a TV series that the user has been watching recently), query against [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLResourceKey\/volumeAvailableCapacityForOpportunisticUsageKey].\n\n### Construct a Query\n\nUse this example as a guide to construct your own query:",
