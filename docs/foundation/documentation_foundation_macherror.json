Ipc code will catch this and reflect it as a message error.\n- **alreadyInSet**: The receive right is already a member of the portset.\n- **alreadyWaiting**: A thread is attempting to wait for an event for which there is already a waiting thread.\n- **codesignError**: During a page fault, indicates that the page was rejected as a result of a signature check.\n- **defaultSet**: An attempt was made to destroy the default processor set.\n- **exceptionProtected**: An attempt was made to fetch an exception port that is protected, or to abort a thread while processing a protected exception.\n- **failure**: The function could not be performed.  A catch-all.\n- **invalidAddress**: Specified address is not currently valid.\n- **invalidArgument**: The function requested was not applicable to this type of argument, or an argument is invalid.\n- **invalidCapability**: The supplied (port) capability is improper.\n- **invalidHost**: Target host isn’t actually a host.\n- **invalidLedger**: A ledger was required but not supplied.\n- **invalidMemoryControl**: The port was not a memory cache control port.\n- **invalidName**: The name doesn’t denote a right in the task.\n- **invalidObject**: The external memory manager failed to initialize the memory object.\n- **invalidPolicy**: The specified scheduling policy is not currently enabled for the processor set.\n- **invalidProcessorSet**: An argument applied to assert processor set privilege was not a processor set control port.\n- **invalidRight**: The name denotes a right, but not an appropriate right.\n- **invalidSecurity**: An argument supplied to assert security privilege was not a host security port.\n- **invalidTask**: Target task isn’t an active task.\n- **invalidValue**: A blatant range error.\n- **lockOwned**: The lock is already owned by another thread.\n- **lockOwnedSelf**: The lock is already owned by the calling thread.\n- **lockSetDestroyed**: Lock set has been destroyed and is no longer available.\n- **lockUnstable**: The thread holding the lock terminated before releasing the lock.\n- **memoryDataMoved**: A page was requested of a memory manager via memory_object_data_request for an object using a MEMORY_OBJECT_COPY_CALL strategy, with the VM_PROT_WANTS_COPY flag being used to specify that the page desired is for a copy of the object, and the memory manager has detected the page was pushed into a copy of the object while the kernel was walking the shadow chain from the copy to the object. This error code is delivered via memory_object_data_error and is handled by the kernel (it forces the kernel to restart the fault). It will not be seen by users.\n- **memoryError**: During a page fault, the memory object indicated that the data could not be returned.  This failure may be temporary; future attempts to access this same data may succeed, as defined by the memory object.\n- **memoryFailure**: During a page fault, the target address refers to a memory object that has been destroyed.  This failure is permanent.\n- **memoryPresent**: An attempt was made to supply “precious” data for memory that is already present in a memory object.\n- **memoryRestartCopy**: A strategic copy was attempted of an object upon which a quicker copy is now possible.  The caller should retry the copy using vm_object_copy_quickly. This error code is seen only by the kernel.\n- **nameExists**: The name already denotes a right in the task.\n- **noAccess**: Bogus access restriction.\n- **noSpace**: The address range specified is already in use, or no address range of the size specified could be found.\n- **nodeDown**: Remote node down or inaccessible.\n- **notDepressed**: thread_depress_abort was called on a thread which was not currently depressed.\n- **notInSet**: The receive right is not a member of a port set.\n- **notReceiver**: The task in question does not hold receive rights for the port argument.\n- **notSupported**: Empty thread activation (No thread linked to it).\n- **notWaiting**: A signalled thread was not actually waiting.\n- **operationTimedOut**: Some thread-oriented operation (semaphore_wait) timed out.\n- **policyLimit**: The specified scheduling attributes exceed the thread’s limits.\n- **policyStatic**: The requested property cannot be changed at this time.\n- **protectionFailure**: Specified memory is valid, but does not permit the required forms of access.\n- **resourceShortage**: A system resource could not be allocated to fulfill this request.  This failure may not be permanent.\n- **rightExists**: The task already has send or receive rights for the port under another name.\n- **rpcContinueOrphan**: Allow an orphaned activation to continue executing.\n- **rpcServerTerminated**: Return from RPC indicating the target server was terminated before it successfully replied.\n- **rpcTerminateOrphan**: Terminate an orphaned activation.\n- **semaphoreDestroyed**: Semaphore has been destroyed and is no longer available.\n- **success**\n- **terminated**: Object has been terminated and is no longer available.\n- **userReferencesOverflow**: Operation would overflow limit on user-references.\n\n## Error Codes\n\n- **CocoaError**: Describes errors within the Cocoa error domain.\n- **POSIXError**: Describes an error in the POSIX error domain.\n- **NSError Codes**: Error codes in the Cocoa error domain.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CustomNSError\n- Equatable\n- Error\n- Hashable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
