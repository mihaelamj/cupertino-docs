These are the same attributes that can be applied to an `NSAttributedString` object, but in the case of `NSString` objects, the attributes apply to the entire string, rather than ranges within the string.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe bounding rect for the receiver drawn using the given options and display characteristics. The rect origin returned from this method is the first glyph origin.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method works in single-line, baseline rendering configuration by default. If the string drawing option `NSStringDrawingUsesLineFragmentOrigin` is specified, the method behaves in multiline configuration.\n\n## Deprecated\n\n- **string(withCString:)**: Creates a new string using a given C-string.\n- **init(CString:)**: Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by converting the data in a given C-string from the default C-string encoding into the Unicode character encoding.\n- **string(withCString:length:)**: Returns a string containing the characters in a given C-string.\n- **init(CString:length:)**: Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by converting the data in a given C-string from the default C-string encoding into the Unicode character encoding.\n- **init(CStringNoCopy:length:freeWhenDone:)**: Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by converting the data in a given C-string from the default C-string encoding into the Unicode character encoding.\n- **string(withContentsOfFile:)**: Returns a string created by reading data from the file named by a given path.\n- **init(contentsOfFile:)**: Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by reading data from the file named by `path`.\n- **string(withContentsOf:)**: Returns a string created by reading data from the file named by a given URL.\n- **init(contentsOfURL:)**: Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by reading data from the location named by a given URL.\n- **write(toFile:atomically:)**: Writes the contents of the receiver to the file specified by a given path.\n- **write(to:atomically:)**: Writes the contents of the receiver to the location specified by a given URL.\n- **getCharacters(_:)**: Copies all characters from the receiver into a given buffer.\n- **cString()**: Returns a representation of the receiver as a C string in the default C-string encoding.\n- **lossyCString()**: Returns a representation of the receiver as a C string in the default C-string encoding, possibly losing information in converting to that encoding.\n- **cStringLength()**: Returns the length in char-sized units of the receiver’s C-string representation in the default C-string encoding.\n\n",
