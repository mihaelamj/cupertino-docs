In its default configuration, a URL session uses a single radio for a network call, preferring Wi-Fi over cellular. However, with Multipath TCP enabled, the URL session initiates the request on both radios and selects the more responsive of the two with a preference for Wi-Fi.\n\n### Enable Multipath TCP in your app\n\nThese steps are required:\n\n- Enable the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.networking.multipath] in the Xcode Capabilities pane for your app target.\n- Set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSessionConfiguration\/multipathServiceType-swift.property] property in [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSessionConfiguration] to a mode other than `none`. For most cases, the handover mode is the best option. This mode provides your users with a seamless transition between Wi-Fi and cellular, allowing uninterrupted usage of your app. (For information about other modes, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSessionConfiguration\/MultipathServiceType-swift.enum].)\n\nWhile the user’s device is connected to a reliable Wi-Fi network, your app uses only Wi-Fi, and no cellular data is consumed. As the user leaves the range of the Wi-Fi network and the signal starts to deteriorate, Multipath TCP begins transitioning data usage to the cellular network to provide a seamless transition.\n\n\n\n### Limitations when using Multipath TCP with Wi-Fi Assist\n\nBecause Wi-Fi Assist is a user selectable, device-wide option, there are a few limitations when using Multipath TCP with that option enabled:\n\n- Wi-Fi Assist prevents flows from using cellular data when your app is in the background.\n- Wi-Fi Assist limits the amount of data that your app can send over cellular networks. When the limit is reached, Multipath TCP is disabled.\n\nWi-Fi Assist is integrated into the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSession] API and doesn’t require any changes to the session configuration. At the start of each URL session task, Wi-Fi Assist determines whether to use Wi-Fi or cellular data for the connection.\n\nAfter the URL session task begins, Wi-Fi Assist doesn’t change from Wi-Fi to cellular or from cellular to Wi-Fi. Multipath TCP extends the performance-improving capabilities of Wi-Fi Assist to provide seamless radio transition and improved throughput.\n\n\n\n## Supporting Multipath TCP\n\n- **multipathServiceType**: A service type that specifies the Multipath TCP connection policy for transmitting data over Wi-Fi and cellular interfaces.\n- **URLSessionConfiguration.MultipathServiceType**: Constants that specify the type of service that Multipath TCP uses.\n- **Multipath Entitlement**: A Boolean value indicating whether your app may use Multipath protocols to seamlessly transition between Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\n\n",
