Pass `NULL` if you do not need this value (in which case the work to compute the value isn’t performed).\n- **lineEndPtr**: Upon return, contains the index of the first character past the terminator of the line containing the end of `aRange`. Pass `NULL` if you do not need this value (in which case the work to compute the value isn’t performed).\n- **contentsEndPtr**: Upon return, contains the index of the first character of the terminator of the line containing the end of `aRange`. Pass `NULL` if you do not need this value (in which case the work to compute the value isn’t performed).\n- **range**: A range within the receiver. The value must not exceed the bounds of the receiver.\n\nRaises an `NSRangeException` if `aRange` is invalid.\n\n## Discussion\n\nA line is delimited by any of these characters, the longest possible sequence being preferred to any shorter:\n\n- `U+000A` Unicode Character ‘LINE FEED (LF)’ (`\\n`)\n- `U+000D` Unicode Character ‘CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)’ (`\\r`)\n- `U+0085` Unicode Character ‘NEXT LINE (NEL)’\n- `U+2028` Unicode Character ‘LINE SEPARATOR’\n- `U+2029` Unicode Character ‘PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR’\n- `\\r\\n`, in that order (also known as `CRLF`)\n\nIf `aRange` is contained with a single line, of course, the returned indexes all belong to that line. You can use the results of this method to construct ranges for lines by using the start index as the range’s location and the difference between the end index and the start index as the range’s length.\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nThis method detects all invalid ranges (including those with negative lengths).
