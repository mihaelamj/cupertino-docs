  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA new `NSDate` instance representing the date calculated by setting a specific component of a given date to a given value. If the unit already has that value, this may result in a date which is the same as the given date. If no such time exists for the specified components, the next available date is returned, which may be on a different calendar day.\n\n## Discussion\n\nChanging a component’s value often requires higher or coupled components to change as well. For example, setting the `weekday` to “Thursday” will require the `day` component to change its value, and possibly the `month` and `year` as well. You can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSCalendar\/nextDate(after:matching:value:options:)] method to specify more precise behavior for determining the next or previous date for a given date component.",
