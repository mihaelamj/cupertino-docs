Default value is `.nextTime`.\n- **repeatedTimePolicy**: Specifies the behavior when multiple matches are found. Default value is `.first`.\n- **direction**: Specifies the direction in time to search. Default is `.forward`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA `Date` representing the result of the search, or `nil` if a result could not be found.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe general semantics follow those of the `enumerateDates` function.
