Subsequent invocations of those methods do not post this notification. Observers of this notification have their notification method invoked in the main thread, not the new thread. The observer notification methods always execute before the new thread begins executing.\n- **NSBundleResourceRequestLowDiskSpace**: Posted after the system detects that the amount of available disk space is getting low. The notification is posted to the default notification center.\n- **NSCalendarDayChanged**: A notification that is posted whenever the calendar day of the system changes, as determined by the system calendar, locale, and time zone.\n- **NSDidBecomeSingleThreaded**: Not implemented.\n- **NSExtensionHostDidBecomeActive**: Posted when the extension’s host app moves from the inactive to the active state.\n- **NSExtensionHostDidEnterBackground**: Posted when the extension’s host app begins running in the background.\n\n",
