If this property contains a value of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], system conditions have changed since the time the activity started and deferral is recommended. For example, perhaps the user unplugged the Mac and it’s now running on battery power. In this case, your app should finish what it’s currently doing, save its state, and invoke its completion handler with a value of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSBackgroundActivityScheduler\/Result\/deferred]. The system will invoke your activity again at a more optimal time, and your app can restore its previous state and resume where it left off.
