However, when it receives a message not in its protocol, it raises an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSExceptionName\/invalidArgumentException] to indicate that the message isn’t allowed, whether or not the target object implements the method.\n\nTypically, an object that is to be distributed (yet must restrict messages) creates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSProtocolChecker] for itself and returns the checker rather than returning itself in response to any messages. The object might also register the checker as the root object of an NSConnection.\n\nThe object should be careful about vending references to `self`—the protocol checker will convert a return value of `self` to indicate the checker rather than the object for any messages forwarded by the checker, but direct references to the object (bypassing the checker) could be passed around by other objects.",
