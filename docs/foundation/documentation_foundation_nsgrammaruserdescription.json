It is recommended that `NSGrammarUserDescription` be supplied in all cases, however, `NSGrammarUserDescription` or `NSGrammarCorrections` must be supplied in order for correction guidance to be presented to the user.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nlet NSGrammarUserDescription: String\n```\n\n## Constants\n\n- **NSGrammarRange**: The value for the `NSGrammarRange` dictionary key should be an `NSValue` containing an `NSRange`, a subrange of the sentence range used as the return value, whose location should be an offset from the beginning of the sentence–so, for example, an `NSGrammarRange` for the first four characters of the overall sentence range should be `{0, 4}`. If the `NSGrammarRange` key is not present in the dictionary it is assumed to be equal to the overall sentence range.\n- **NSGrammarCorrections**: The value for the `NSGrammarCorrections` key should be an `NSArray` of `NSStrings` representing potential substitutions to correct the problem, but it is expected that this may not be available in all cases. `NSGrammarUserDescription` or `NSGrammarCorrections` must be supplied in order for correction guidance to be presented to the user.\n\n",
