After you add an operation to a queue, it remains in the queue until the operation finishes its task. You can’t directly remove an operation from a queue after you add it.\n\nFor more information about using operation queues, see the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide\/Introduction\/Introduction.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008091].\n\n### Determine the Execution Order\n\nAn operation queue organizes and invokes its operations according to their readiness, priority level, and interoperation dependencies. If all of the queued operations have the same [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation\/queuePriority-swift.property] and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation\/isReady] property returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], the queue invokes them in the order you added them. Otherwise, the operation queue always invokes the operation with the highest priority relative to the other ready operations.\n\nHowever, don’t rely on queue semantics to ensure a specific execution order of operations  because changes in the readiness of an operation can change the resulting execution order. Interoperation dependencies provide an absolute execution order for operations, even if those operations are located in different operation queues. An operation object isn’t ready to run until all of its dependent operations have finished running.\n\nFor details on how to set priority levels and dependencies, see Managing Dependencies in [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation].\n\n### Respond to Operation Cancelation\n\nFinishing its task doesn’t necessarily mean that the operation performed that task to completion; an operation can also be canceled. Canceling an operation object leaves the object in the queue but notifies the object that it should stop its task as quickly as possible. For currently executing operations, this means that the operation object’s work code must check the cancellation state, stop what it is doing, and mark itself as finished. For operations that are queued but not yet executing, the queue must still call the operation object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation\/start()] method so that it can processes the cancellation event and mark itself as finished.\n\nFor more information about operation cancellation, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation#Responding-to-the-Cancel-Command] in [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Operation].\n\n### Observe Operations Using Key-Value Observing\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/OperationQueue] class is key-value coding (KVC) and key-value observing (KVO) compliant. You can observe these properties to control other parts of your application. To observe the properties, use the following key paths:\n\nAlthough you can attach observers to these properties, don’t use Cocoa bindings to bind these properties to elements of your application’s user interface. Code associated with your user interface typically must run only in your app’s main thread.
