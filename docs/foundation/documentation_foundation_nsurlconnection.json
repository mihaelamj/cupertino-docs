  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn `NSURLConnection` object lets you load the contents of a URL by providing a URL request object. The interface for `NSURLConnection` is sparse, providing only the controls to start and cancel asynchronous loads of a URL request. You perform most of your configuration on the URL request object itself.\n\nThe `NSURLConnection` class provides convenience class methods to load URL requests both asynchronously using a callback block and synchronously.\n\nFor greater control, you can create a URL connection object with a delegate object that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDelegate] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDataDelegate] protocols. The connection calls methods on that delegate to provide you with progress and status as the URL request is loaded asynchronously. The connection also calls delegate methods to let you override the connection’s default behavior (for example, specifying how a particular redirect should be handled). These delegate methods are called on the thread that initiated the asynchronous load operation.\n\nFor more information about errors, see the `NSURLError.h` header, [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/foundation-constants], and URL Loading System Error Codes in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/ErrorHandlingCocoa\/ErrorHandling\/ErrorHandling.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40001806].\n\n### NSURLConnection Protocols\n\nThe `NSURLConnection` class works in tandem with three formal protocols: [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDelegate], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDataDelegate], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate]. To use these protocols, you write a class that conforms to them and implement any methods that are appropriate, then provide an instance of that class as the delegate when you create a connection object.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDelegate] protocol is primarily used for credential handling, but also handles connection completion. Because it handles connection failure during data transfers, all connection delegates must typically implement this protocol.\n\nIn addition, unless you’re using Newsstand Kit, your delegate must also conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDataDelegate] protocol, because this protocol provides methods that the `NSURLConnection` class calls with progress information during an upload, with fragments of the response data during a download, and to provide a new upload body stream if the server’s response necessitates a second connection attempt—for example, if `NSURLConnection` must retry the request with different credentials.\n\nFinally, if you’re using Newsstand Kit, your delegate can conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDownloadDelegate] protocol. This protocol provides support for continuing interrupted file downloads and receiving a notification whenever a download finishes. This protocol is solely for use with `NSURLConnection` objects created using Newsstand Kit’s `download(with:)` method.",
