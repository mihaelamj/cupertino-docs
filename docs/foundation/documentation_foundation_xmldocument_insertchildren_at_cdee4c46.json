The indexes of children after the new child are increased by `[children count`]. If `index` is less than zero or greater than the number of children, an out-of-bounds exception is raised.\n\n## Adding and Removing Child Nodes\n\n- **addChild(_:)**: Adds a child node after the last of the receiver’s existing children.\n- **insertChild(_:at:)**: Inserts a node object at specified position in the receiver’s array of children.\n- **removeChild(at:)**: Removes the child node of the receiver located at a specified position in its array of children.\n- **replaceChild(at:with:)**: Replaces the child node of the receiver located at a specified position in its array of children with another node.\n- **setChildren(_:)**: Sets the child nodes of the receiver.\n\n",
