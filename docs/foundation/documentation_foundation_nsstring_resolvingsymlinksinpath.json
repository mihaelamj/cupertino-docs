For absolute paths, all symbolic links are guaranteed to be removed. For relative paths, symbolic links that can’t be resolved are left unresolved in the returned string.\n\nReturns `self` if an error occurs.\n\nNote that this method only works with file paths (not, for example, string representations of URLs).\n\n## Working with Paths\n\n- **path(withComponents:)**: Returns a string built from the strings in a given array by concatenating them with a path separator between each pair.\n- **pathComponents**: The file-system path components of the receiver.\n- **completePath(into:caseSensitive:matchesInto:filterTypes:)**: Interprets the receiver as a path in the file system and attempts to perform filename completion, returning a numeric value that indicates whether a match was possible, and by reference the longest path that matches the receiver.\n- **fileSystemRepresentation**: A file system-specific representation of the receiver.\n- **getFileSystemRepresentation(_:maxLength:)**: Interprets the receiver as a system-independent path and fills a buffer with a C-string in a format and encoding suitable for use with file-system calls.\n- **isAbsolutePath**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver represents an absolute path.\n- **lastPathComponent**: The last path component of the receiver.\n- **pathExtension**: The path extension, if any, of the string as interpreted as a path.\n- **abbreviatingWithTildeInPath**: A new string that replaces the current home directory portion of the current path with a tilde (`~`) character.\n- **appendingPathComponent(_:)**: Returns a new string made by appending to the receiver a given string.\n- **appendingPathExtension(_:)**: Returns a new string made by appending to the receiver an extension separator followed by a given extension.\n- **deletingLastPathComponent**: A new string made by deleting the last path component from the receiver, along with any final path separator.\n- **deletingPathExtension**: A new string made by deleting the extension (if any, and only the last) from the receiver.\n- **expandingTildeInPath**: A new string made by expanding the initial component of the receiver to its full path value.\n- **standardizingPath**: A new string made by removing extraneous path components from the receiver.\n\n",
