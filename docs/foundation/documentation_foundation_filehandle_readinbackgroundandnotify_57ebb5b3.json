You must call this method from a thread that has an active run loop.\n\nThe length of the data is limited to the buffer size of the underlying operating system. The notification includes a `userInfo` dictionary that contains the data read; access this object using the `NSFileHandleNotificationDataItem` key.\n\nAny object interested in receiving this data asynchronously must add itself as an observer of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileHandle\/readCompletionNotification]. In communication via stream-type sockets, the receiver is often the object returned in the `userInfo` dictionary of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNotification\/Name-swift.struct\/NSFileHandleConnectionAccepted].\n\nNote that this method does not cause a continuous stream of notifications to be sent. If you wish to keep getting notified, you’ll also need to call [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileHandle\/readInBackgroundAndNotify()] in your observer method.",
