  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYou can use this type in Swift instead of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Dictionary] in cases that require reference semantics.\n\nThe `NSDictionary` class declares the programmatic interface to objects that manage immutable associations of keys and values. For example, an interactive form could be represented as a dictionary, with the field names as keys, corresponding to user-entered values.\n\nUse this class or its subclass [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSMutableDictionary] when you need a convenient and efficient way to retrieve data associated with an arbitrary key. `NSDictionary` creates static dictionaries, and `NSMutableDictionary` creates dynamic dictionaries. (For convenience, the term *dictionary* refers to any instance of one of these classes without specifying its exact class membership.)\n\nA key-value pair within a dictionary is called an entry. Each entry consists of one object that represents the key and a second object that is that key’s value. Within a dictionary, the keys are unique. That is, no two keys in a single dictionary are equal (as determined by [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObjectProtocol\/isEqual(_:)]). In general, a key can be any object (provided that it conforms to the `NSCopying` protocol—see below), but note that when using key-value coding the key must be a string (see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/KeyValueCoding\/BasicPrinciples.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/20002170]). Neither a key nor a value can be `nil`; if you need to represent a null value in a dictionary, you should use [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNull].\n\n`NSDictionary` is “toll-free bridged” with its Core Foundation counterpart, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFDictionary]. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/CocoaEncyclopedia\/Toll-FreeBridgin\/Toll-FreeBridgin.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40010810-CH2] for more information on toll-free bridging.\n\n### Creating NSDictionary Objects Using Dictionary Literals\n\nIn addition to the provided initializers, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDictionary\/init(objects:forKeys:)], you can create an `NSDictionary` object using a *dictionary literal*.\n\nIn Objective-C, the compiler generates code that makes an underlying call to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDictionary\/dictionaryWithObjects:forKeys:count:] method.\n\nUnlike [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDictionary\/dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:] and other initializers, dictionary literals specify entries in key-value order. You should not terminate the list of objects with `nil` when using this literal syntax, and in fact `nil` is an invalid value. For more information about object literals in Objective-C, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC\/WorkingwithObjects\/WorkingwithObjects.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40011210-CH4] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC\/Introduction\/Introduction.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40011210].\n\nIn Swift, the `NSDictionary` class conforms to the `DictionaryLiteralConvertible` protocol, which allows it to be initialized with dictionary literals. For more information about object literals in Swift, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Swift\/Conceptual\/Swift_Programming_Language\/Expressions.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40014097-CH32-ID390] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Swift\/Conceptual\/Swift_Programming_Language\/index.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40014097].\n\n### Accessing Values Using Subscripting\n\nIn addition to the provided instance methods, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDictionary\/object(forKey:)], you can access `NSDictionary` values by their keys using *subscripting*.\n\n### Enumerating Entries Using for-in Loops\n\nIn addition to the provided instance methods, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDictionary\/enumerateKeysAndObjects(_:)], you can enumerate `NSDictionary` entries using *for-in loops*.\n\nIn Objective-C, `NSDictionary` conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFastEnumeration] protocol.\n\nIn Swift, `NSDictionary` conforms to the `SequenceType` protocol.\n\n### Subclassing Notes\n\nYou generally shouldn’t need to subclass `NSDictionary`. Custom behavior can usually be achieved through composition rather than subclassing.\n\n#### Methods to Override\n\nIf you do need to subclass `NSDictionary`, take into account that it is a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/DevPedia-CocoaCore\/ClassCluster.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008195-CH7]. Any subclass must override the following primitive methods:\n\nThe other methods of `NSDictionary` operate by invoking one or more of these primitives. The non-primitive methods provide convenient ways of accessing multiple entries at once.\n\n#### Alternatives to Subclassing\n\nBefore making a custom class of `NSDictionary`, investigate [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSMapTable] and the corresponding Core Foundation type, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFDictionary]. Because `NSDictionary` and `CFDictionary` are “toll-free bridged,” you can substitute a `CFDictionary` object for a `NSDictionary` object in your code (with appropriate casting). Although they are corresponding types, `CFDictionary` and `NSDictionary` do not have identical interfaces or implementations, and you can sometimes do things with `CFDictionary` that you cannot easily do with `NSDictionary`.\n\nIf the behavior you want to add supplements that of the existing class, you could write a category on `NSDictionary`.
