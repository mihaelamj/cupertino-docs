  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIn Swift, this object bridges to [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL]; use [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] when you need reference semantics or other Foundation-specific behavior.\n\nYou can use URL objects to construct URLs and access their parts. For URLs that represent local files, you can also manipulate properties of those files directly, such as changing the file’s last modification date. Finally, you can pass URL objects to other APIs to retrieve the contents of those URLs. For example, you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSession], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnection], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLDownload] classes to access the contents of remote resources, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/url-loading-system].\n\nURL objects are the preferred way to refer to local files. Most objects that read data from or write data to a file have methods that accept an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] object instead of a pathname as the file reference. For example, you can get the contents of a local file URL as an `NSString` object using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString\/init(contentsOfURL:encoding:)-715fw] initializer, or as an `NSData` object using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSData\/init(contentsOfURL:options:)-5abi3] initializer.\n\nYou can also use URLs for interapplication communication. In macOS, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWorkspace] class provides the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSWorkspace\/open(_:)] method to open a location specified by a URL. Similarly, in iOS, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication] class provides the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/open(_:options:completionHandler:)] method.\n\nAdditionally, you can use URLs when working with pasteboards, as described in NSURL Additions Reference (part of the AppKit framework).\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] class is “toll-free bridged” with its Core Foundation counterpart, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFURL]. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/CocoaEncyclopedia\/Toll-FreeBridgin\/Toll-FreeBridgin.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40010810-CH2] for more information on toll-free bridging.\n\n### Structure of a URL\n\nAn [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] object is composed of two parts—a potentially `nil` base URL and a string that is resolved relative to the base URL. An [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] object is considered absolute if its string part is fully resolved without a base; all other URLs are considered relative.\n\nFor example, when constructing an `NSURL` object, you might specify `file:\/\/\/path\/to\/user\/` as the base URL and `folder\/file.html` as the string part, as follows:\n\nWhen fully resolved, the absolute URL is `file:\/\/\/path\/to\/user\/folder\/file.html`.\n\nA URL can be also be divided into pieces based on its structure. For example, the URL `https:\/\/johnny:p4ssw0rd@www.example.com:443\/script.ext;param=value?query=value#ref` contains the following URL components:\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] class provides properties that let you examine each of these components.\n\nFor apps linked before iOS 17, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] class parses URLs according to [https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc1808], [https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc1738], and [https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc2732].\n\n### Bookmarks and Security Scope\n\nStarting with OS X v10.6 and iOS 4.0, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] class provides a facility for creating and using bookmark objects. A **bookmark** provides a persistent reference to a file-system resource. When you resolve a bookmark, you obtain a URL to the resource’s current location. A bookmark’s association with a file-system resource (typically a file or folder) usually continues to work if the user moves or renames the resource, or if the user relaunches your app or restarts the system.\n\nFor a general introduction to using bookmarks, read [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/FileManagement\/Conceptual\/FileSystemProgrammingGuide\/AccessingFilesandDirectories\/AccessingFilesandDirectories.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40010672-CH3-SW10] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/FileManagement\/Conceptual\/FileSystemProgrammingGuide\/Introduction\/Introduction.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40010672].\n\nIn a macOS app that adopts App Sandbox, you can use **security-scoped bookmarks** to gain access to file-system resources outside your app’s sandbox. These bookmarks preserve the user’s intent to give your app access to a resource across app launches. For details on how this works, including information on the entitlements you need in your Xcode project, read [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Security\/Conceptual\/AppSandboxDesignGuide\/AppSandboxInDepth\/AppSandboxInDepth.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40011183-CH3-SW16] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Security\/Conceptual\/AppSandboxDesignGuide\/AboutAppSandbox\/AboutAppSandbox.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40011183]. The methods for using security-scoped bookmarks are described in this document in Working with Bookmark Data.\n\nWhen you resolve a security-scoped bookmark, you get a security-scoped URL.\n\n### Security-Scoped URLs\n\nSecurity-scoped URLs provide access to resources outside an app’s sandbox. In macOS, you get access to security-scoped URLs when you resolve a security-scoped bookmark. In iOS, apps that *open* or *move* documents using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDocumentPickerViewController] also receive security-scoped URLs.\n\nTo gain access to a security-scoped URL, you must call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()] method (or its Core Foundation equivalent, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFURLStartAccessingSecurityScopedResource(_:)] function). For iOS apps, if you use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDocument] to access the URL, it automatically manages the security-scoped URL for you.\n\nIf `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource` (or `CFUrLStartAccessingSecurityScopedResource`) returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], you must relinquish your access by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()] method (or its Core Foundation equivalent, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CFURLStopAccessingSecurityScopedResource(_:)] function). You should relinquish your access as soon as you have finished using the file. After you call these methods, you immediately lose access to the resource in question.\n\n#### Security-Scoped URLs and String Paths\n\nIn a macOS app, when you copy a security-scoped URL, the copy has the security scope of the original. You gain access to the file-system resource (that the URL points to) just as you would with the original URL: by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()] method (or its Core Foundation equivalent).\n\nIf you need a security-scoped URL’s path as a string value (as provided by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/path] method), such as to provide to an API that requires a string value, obtain the path from the URL as needed. Note, however, that a string-based path obtained from a security-scoped URL *does not* have security scope and you cannot use that string to obtain access to a security-scoped resource.\n\n### iCloud Document Thumbnails\n\nWith OS X v10.10 and iOS 8.0, the NSURL class includes the ability to get and set document thumbnails as a resource property for iCloud documents. You can get a dictionary of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSImage] objects in macOS or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImage] objects in iOS using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/getResourceValue(_:forKey:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/getPromisedItemResourceValue(_:forKey:)] methods.\n\nIn macOS, you can set a dictionary of thumbnails using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL\/setResourceValue(_:forKey:)] method. You can also get or set all the thumbnails as an `NSImage` object with multiple representations by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLResourceKey\/thumbnailKey].",
