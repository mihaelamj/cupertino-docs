Returns `nil` if larger is not logically bigger than smaller in the calendar, or the given combination of components does not make sense (or is a computation which is undefined).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe ordinality is in most cases not the same as the decomposed value of the component. Typically return values are 1 and greater. For example, the time 00:45 is in the first hour of the day, and for components `hour` and `day` respectively, the result would be 1. An exception is the week-in-month calculation, which returns 0 for days before the first week in the month containing the date.",

Returns `nil` if larger is not logically bigger than smaller in the calendar, or the given combination of components does not make sense (or is a computation which is undefined).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe ordinality is in most cases not the same as the decomposed value of the component.
