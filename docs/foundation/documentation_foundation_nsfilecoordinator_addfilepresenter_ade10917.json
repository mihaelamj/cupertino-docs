Thus, any file coordinator objects you create later automatically know about the file presenter object and know to message it when its file or directory is affected.\n\nBe sure to balance calls to this method with a corresponding call to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/removeFilePresenter(_:)] method. You must remove file presenters from the process wide registry before the object is deallocated, even in a garbage-collected application.\n\nIf you call this method while coordinated file operations are already under way in another process, your file presenter may not receive notifications for that operation. To prevent missing such notifications, create a file coordinator, call its  [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFileCoordinator\/coordinate(readingItemAt:options:error:byAccessor:)] method, and register your file presenter object there. If you are going to read a file and then create a file presenter for that file, both actions should occur in the same coordinated read block. Synchronizing on the presented file or directory guarantees that when your block executes, all other objects have completed any tasks and you have sole access to the item.",
