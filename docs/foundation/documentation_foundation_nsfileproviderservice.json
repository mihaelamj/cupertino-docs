This service performs actions only on items managed by the File Provider extension.

Both the app and the File Provider extension must agree upon the service’s name and protocol.  Communicate the name and protocol through an outside source (for example, posting a header file that defines both the name and protocol, or publishing a library that includes them both).\n\nThe service can be defined by either the app or the File Provider extension:\n\n- Apps can define a service for features they would like to use. File providers can then choose to support those features by implementing the service.\n- File Provider extensions can provide a service for the features they support. Apps can then choose to use the specified service.\n\nWhen defining a service’s protocol, the parameters for each method must adhere to the following rules:\n\n- The parameter’s class must conform to [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSSecureCoding].\n- The parameter’s class must be defined in both the app and the File Provider extension (for example, standard system types or classes defined in a library imported by both sides).\n- If a collection parameter contains types other than property list types (see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/DevPedia-CocoaCore\/PropertyList.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008195-CH44-SW2]), declare the valid types using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSXPCInterface] class’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSXPCInterface\/classes(for:argumentIndex:ofReply:)] method.\n\n## Accessing the Service\n\n- **name**: The File Provider service’s name.\n- **getFileProviderConnection(completionHandler:)**: Asynchronously returns the service’s connection object.\n\n## Accessing file provider services\n\n- **getFileProviderServicesForItem(at:completionHandler:)**: Returns the services provided by the File Provider extension that manages the item at the given URL.\n- **NSFileProviderServiceName**: The name used to identify a File Provider service.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSObjectProtocol\n\n",
