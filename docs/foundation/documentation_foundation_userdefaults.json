  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA `UserDefaults` object provides access to the defaults system, which is a persistent store for app-specific and system-wide settings. You use this system to store nonsensitive information, such as app-specific configuration details. The system also stores configuration details that apply to all apps, such as the current language settings for the device. In your code, you check values from this system and use them to dynamically alter your app’s appearance or behavior. The term *defaults* refers to the fact that the stored data determines the default startup state and behavior.\n\nTo access the defaults system, obtain a `UserDefaults` object and call its methods to read and write values. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UserDefaults\/standard] object is a shared object you use to read and write your app’s standard settings. You can also create unique `UserDefaults` objects to manage specific sets of settings. For example, you can create a `UserDefaults` object that reads and writes settings your app shares with an app extension. Don’t subclass `UserDefaults`.\n\nEach item you store in a defaults object consists of a key-value pair, where each key is a string that you use to locate the item and each value is a data object. The defaults database supports the same value types found in property list files, including types like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Int], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Float], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Double], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Bool], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/String], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNumber], [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Date], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Array], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Dictionary]. To include other types of objects in the defaults database, archive them to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Data] object first and store that object instead. Prefer simple types over custom objects whenever possible.\n\nWith the exception of managed devices in educational institutions, the system stores defaults locally on the current device. When you write values to a `UserDefaults` object, the object updates its in-memory version of that information right away, and writes the value to disk asynchronously.  When someone backs up their device, the system includes any persistent defaults databases in the backup data. Because the data is device-specific, you don’t use the defaults system to share data between devices. To share data between someone’s devices, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore] instead.\n\nWhile your app is running, the defaults system generates notifications to let you know when values change. To observe changes to individual settings, add a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/using-key-value-observing-in-swift] to your `UserDefaults` object, using key names to build the path to the setting you want. To observe changes for all settings, register for a [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UserDefaults\/DidChangeMessage] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UserDefaults\/didChangeNotification] with your `UserDefaults` object.\n\nThe `UserDefaults` type is thread-safe, and you can use the same object in multiple threads or tasks simultaneously.\n\n### Domains and settings search paths\n\nTo integrate settings from different sources, the defaults system organizes them into domains. An app defines its own custom settings, but the system defines settings that apply to all apps. Similarly, you might choose to override a specific setting temporarily to test one of your app’s features. The defaults system provides domains for each of these cases along with several others.\n\nWhen you request the value of a setting, the `UserDefaults` object searches its domains in a specific order until it finds the value you want. The following table lists the key domains that the defaults system supports and their search order. Some domains might not be present for all apps. For example, the managed domain is present only on administrator-managed devices.\n\nThe system stores data for most persistent domains on the current device, and doesn’t share that data with other devices. To share settings among all of a person’s devices, save them using an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore] object instead.\n\n### Settings in managed environments\n\nIf your app supports managed environments, an administrator might configure any managed devices with a default set of settings. For example, in a computer lab or classrom environment, a teacher might set default settings that the lessons require. Apps can’t write to managed domains, so if your app encounters a managed setting, disable or hide any controls that someone might use to change that setting’s value. To determine if a setting is managed, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UserDefaults\/objectIsForced(forKey:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UserDefaults\/objectIsForced(forKey:inDomain:)] method of your `UserDefaults` object.\n\nAn app running on a managed device can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore] to share small amounts of data with the person’s other devices. Use this store for data that your app can safely share with other instances of itself. For example, a textbook app might save the current page number so that the person can continue reading from the same place on any of their devices.\n\nFor more details about managing devices, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DeviceManagement].\n\n### Sandbox considerations\n\nA sandboxed app cannot access or modify the settings of another app or process, with the following exceptions:\n\nIf you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UserDefaults\/addSuite(named:)] method to add the identifier for an unrelated app, the method doesn’t give you access to the other app’s settings. Instead, the system writes changes to your app’s settings, not to the third-party app’s settings.",
