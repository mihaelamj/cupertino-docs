This is the primary code used to identify the command in Apple events.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn an Apple event that specifies a script command, two four character codes—the event class and event ID—together identify the command. You use this method to obtain the event class. You use [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSScriptCommandDescription\/appleEventCode] to obtain the event ID.\n\nFor example, commands in AppleScript’s Core suite, such as `clone`, `count`, and `create`, have an event class code of `'core'`. This code and the event ID code returned by `appleEventCode` together specify the necessary information for identifying and dispatching an Apple event.",
