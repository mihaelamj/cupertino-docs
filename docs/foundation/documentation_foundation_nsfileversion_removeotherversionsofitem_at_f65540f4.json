In other words, always call this method from a block passed to a file coordinator object to initiate a write operation. Doing so ensures that no other processes are operating on the file while you remove the version information.\n\nIf successful, subsequent requests for the versions of the file reflect that only the current version is available. You can use this method to free up disk space by removing versions that are no longer needed.",
