If `length` bytes aren’t available, this method returns the data from the current file pointer to the end of the file. If the handle represents a communications channel, the method reads up to `length` bytes from the channel. Returns an empty `NSData` object if the handle is at the file’s end or if the communications channel returns an end-of-file indicator.",
