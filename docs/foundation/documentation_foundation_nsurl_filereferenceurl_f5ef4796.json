This form of file URL remains valid when the file system path of the URL’s underlying resource changes.\n\nIf the original URL is a file path URL, this property contains a copy of the URL converted into a file reference URL. If the original URL is a file reference URL, this property contains the original. If the original URL is not a file URL, this property contains `nil`.\n\nFile reference URLs cannot be created to file system objects which do not exist or are not reachable. This property contains `nil` instead.\n\nIn some areas of the file system hierarchy, file reference URLs cannot be generated to the leaf node of the URL path.",
