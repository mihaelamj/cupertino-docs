Specify a notification name to deliver only entries with this notification name.\n\nWhen `nil`, the sender doesn’t use notification names as criteria for delivery.\n- **obj**: The object that sends notifications to the observer block. Specify a sender to deliver only notifications from this sender.\n\nWhen `nil`, the notification center doesn’t use the sender as criteria for the delivery.\n- **queue**: The operation queue where the `block` runs.\n\nWhen `nil`, the block runs synchronously on the posting thread.\n- **block**: The block that executes when receiving a notification.\n\nThe notification center copies the block. The notification center strongly holds the copied block until you remove the observer registration.\n\nThe block takes one argument: the notification.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn opaque object to act as the observer. Notification center strongly holds this return value until you remove the observer registration.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf a notification triggers more than one observer block, the blocks can all execute concurrently (but on their queue or on the current thread).\n\nThe following example shows how you can register to receive locale change notifications.
