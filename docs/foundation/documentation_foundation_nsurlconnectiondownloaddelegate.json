The methods in this protocol provide progress information about the download of a URL asset and, when downloading concludes, provide a file URL where the downloaded file can be accessed.\n\nIn addition to the methods described in this protocol, an `NSURLConnection` delegate should also implement the methods described in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURLConnectionDelegate] protocol.",
