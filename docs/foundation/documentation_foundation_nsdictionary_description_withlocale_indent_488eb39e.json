In OS X v10.4 and earlier it must be an instance of `NSDictionary`.\n- **level**: Specifies a level of indentation, to make the output more readable: the indentation is (4 spaces) * `level`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA string object that represents the contents of the dictionary, formatted as a property list.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe returned `NSString` object contains the string representations of each of the dictionary’s entries. [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDictionary\/description(withLocale:indent:)] obtains the string representation of a given key or value as follows:\n\n- If the object is an `NSString` object, it is used as is.\n- If the object responds to `descriptionWithLocale:indent:`, that method is invoked to obtain the object’s string representation.\n- If the object responds to `descriptionWithLocale:`, that method is invoked to obtain the object’s string representation.\n- If none of the above conditions is met, the object’s string representation is obtained by through its `description` property.\n\nIf each key in the dictionary responds to `compare:`, the entries are listed in ascending order, by key. Otherwise, the order in which the entries are listed is undefined.\n\n## Describing a Dictionary\n\n- **description**: A string that represents the contents of the dictionary, formatted as a property list.\n- **descriptionInStringsFileFormat**: A string that represents the contents of the dictionary, formatted in `.strings` file format.\n- **description(withLocale:)**: Returns a string object that represents the contents of the dictionary, formatted as a property list.\n\n",
