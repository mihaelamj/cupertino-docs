Typically, this means one of the following:\n\n- A single localization that isn’t region-specific\n- A region-specific localization, followed by a corresponding localization that isn’t region-specific, as a fallback\n\nThis method doesn’t return all localizations in order of user preference. To get this information, you can call this method repeatedly, each time removing the identifiers returned by the previous call.\n\n## Getting Localization Information\n\n- **localizations**: A list of all the localizations contained in the bundle.\n- **preferredLocalizations**: An ordered list of preferred localizations contained in the bundle.\n- **developmentLocalization**: The localization for the development language.\n- **localizedInfoDictionary**: A dictionary with the keys from the bundle’s localized property list.\n- **preferredLocalizations(from:)**: Returns one or more localizations from the specified list that a bundle object would use to locate resources for the current user.\n\n",
