Parsing name components from a representation created for an existing name components object may not produce equivalent results.\n\n\n\nHere are some general rules that describe the name component parsing behavior:\n\n- Names in Latin script have components delimited by whitespace.\n- The format style parses names with a single delimited component into their most likely name component.\n- Names in Latin script with more than two delimited components may include middle components in the `givenName`, `middleName`, or `familyName` name components.\n- The format style may parse names in inverted Latin script into components in a different order than they appear. Inverted names in CJK script won’t typically produce the correct results.\n- Names in Latin script may use a comma to indicate name inversion.\n- Names in Latin script have capitalization preserved between string representation and parsed components.\n- The format style ignores text between parentheses or brackets, as well as extraneous characters in names.\n\n\n\n## Parsing Person Name Components\n\n- **init(_:strategy:)**: Creates a person name components object from a given string by applying the provided parsing strategy.\n\n",
