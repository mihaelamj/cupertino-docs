Specifying a negative value has the effect of inverting the direction of the axes in addition to scaling them. A scaling factor of 1.0 scales the content to exactly the same size.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAfter invoking this method, applying the receiver’s matrix modifies the unit lengths along the current x and y axes by a factor of `scale`, in addition to performing all previous transformations.\n\n## Accumulating Transformations\n\n- **rotate(byDegrees:)**: Applies a rotation factor (measured in degrees) to the receiver’s transformation matrix.\n- **rotate(byRadians:)**: Applies a rotation factor (measured in radians) to the receiver’s transformation matrix.\n- **scaleX(by:yBy:)**: Applies scaling factors to each axis of the receiver’s transformation matrix.\n- **translateX(by:yBy:)**: Applies the specified translation factors to the receiver’s transformation matrix.\n- **append(_:)**: Appends the specified matrix to the receiver’s matrix.\n- **prepend(_:)**: Prepends the specified matrix to the receiver’s matrix.\n- **invert()**: Replaces the receiver’s matrix with its inverse matrix.\n\n",
