However, the objects are not critical to the application and can be discarded if memory is tight.

If memory is needed by other applications, these policies remove some items from the cache, minimizing its memory footprint.\n- You can add, remove, and query items in the cache from different threads without having to lock the cache yourself.\n- Unlike an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSMutableDictionary] object, a cache does not copy the key objects that are put into it.\n\nYou typically use [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSCache] objects to temporarily store objects with transient data that are expensive to create.
