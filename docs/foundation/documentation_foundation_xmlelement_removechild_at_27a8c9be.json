An exception is raised if `index` is out of bounds.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe XML node object is released upon removal. The indices of subsequent children are decremented by one.\n\n## Manipulating Child Elements\n\n- **addChild(_:)**: Adds a child node at the end of the receiver’s current list of children.\n- **insertChild(_:at:)**: Inserts a new child node at a specified location in the receiver’s list of child nodes.\n- **insertChildren(_:at:)**: Inserts an array of child nodes at a specified location in the receiver’s list of children.\n- **replaceChild(at:with:)**: Replaces a child node at a specified location with another child node.\n- **setChildren(_:)**: Sets all child nodes of the receiver at once, replacing any existing children.\n- **normalizeAdjacentTextNodesPreservingCDATA(_:)**: Coalesces adjacent text nodes of the receiver that you have explicitly added, optionally including CDATA sections.\n\n",
