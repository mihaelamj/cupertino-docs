The default value is `false`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new date, or nil if a date could not be calculated with the given input.\n\n## Calculating Dates from Components\n\n- **date(from:)**: Returns a date created from the specified components.\n- **date(byAdding:value:to:wrappingComponents:)**: Returns a new `Date` representing the date calculated by adding an amount of a specific component to a given date.\n- **date(bySetting:value:of:)**: Returns a new `Date` representing the date calculated by setting a specific component to a given time, and trying to keep lower components the same.  If the component already has that value, this may result in a date which is the same as the given date.\n- **date(bySettingHour:minute:second:of:matchingPolicy:repeatedTimePolicy:direction:)**: Returns a new `Date` representing the date calculated by setting hour, minute, and second to a given time on a specified `Date`.\n\n",
