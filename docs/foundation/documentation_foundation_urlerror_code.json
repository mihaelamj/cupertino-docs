secure network connection.\n- **backgroundSessionInUseByAnotherProcess**: An app or app extension attempted to connect to a background session that is already connected to a process.\n- **backgroundSessionRequiresSharedContainer**: The shared container identifier of the URL session configuration is needed but has not been set.\n- **backgroundSessionWasDisconnected**: The app is suspended or exits while a background data task is processing.\n- **badServerResponse**: The URL Loading system received bad data from the server.\n- **badURL**: A malformed URL prevented a URL request from being initiated.\n- **callIsActive**: A connection was attempted while a phone call is active on a network that does not support simultaneous phone and data communication (EDGE or GPRS).\n- **cancelled**: An asynchronous load has been canceled.\n- **cannotCloseFile**: A download task couldn’t close the downloaded file on disk.\n- **cannotConnectToHost**: An attempt to connect to a host failed.\n- **cannotCreateFile**: A download task couldn’t create the downloaded file on disk because of an I\/O failure.\n- **cannotDecodeContentData**: Content data received during a connection request had an unknown content encoding.\n- **cannotDecodeRawData**: Content data received during a connection request could not be decoded for a known content encoding.\n- **cannotFindHost**: The host name for a URL could not be resolved.\n- **cannotLoadFromNetwork**: A request to load an item only from the cache could not be satisfied.\n- **cannotMoveFile**: A download task was unable to move a downloaded file on disk.\n- **cannotOpenFile**: A download task was unable to open the downloaded file on disk.\n- **cannotParseResponse**: A task could not parse a response.\n- **cannotRemoveFile**: A download task was unable to remove a downloaded file from disk.\n- **cannotWriteToFile**: A download task was unable to write to the downloaded file on disk.\n- **clientCertificateRejected**: A server certificate was rejected.\n- **clientCertificateRequired**: A client certificate was required to authenticate an SSL connection during a request.\n- **dataLengthExceedsMaximum**: The length of the resource data exceeds the maximum allowed.\n- **dataNotAllowed**: The cellular network disallowed a connection.\n- **dnsLookupFailed**: The host address could not be found via DNS lookup.\n- **downloadDecodingFailedMidStream**: A download task failed to decode an encoded file during the download.\n- **downloadDecodingFailedToComplete**: A download task failed to decode an encoded file after downloading.\n- **fileDoesNotExist**: A file does not exist.\n- **fileIsDirectory**: A request for an FTP file resulted in the server responding that the file is not a plain file, but a directory.\n- **httpTooManyRedirects**: A redirect loop has been detected or the threshold for number of allowable redirects has been exceeded (currently 16).\n- **internationalRoamingOff**: The attempted connection required activating a data context while roaming, but international roaming is disabled.\n- **networkConnectionLost**: A client or server connection was severed in the middle of an in-progress load.\n- **noPermissionsToReadFile**: A resource couldn’t be read because of insufficient permissions.\n- **notConnectedToInternet**: A network resource was requested, but an internet connection has not been established and cannot be established automatically.\n- **redirectToNonExistentLocation**: A redirect was specified by way of server response code, but the server did not accompany this code with a redirect URL.\n- **requestBodyStreamExhausted**: A body stream is needed but the client did not provide one.\n- **resourceUnavailable**: A requested resource couldn’t be retrieved.\n- **secureConnectionFailed**: An attempt to establish a secure connection failed for reasons that can’t be expressed more specifically.\n- **serverCertificateHasBadDate**: A server certificate had a date which indicates it has expired, or is not yet valid.\n- **serverCertificateHasUnknownRoot**: A server certificate was not signed by any root server.\n- **serverCertificateNotYetValid**: A server certificate is not yet valid.\n- **serverCertificateUntrusted**: A server certificate was signed by a root server that
