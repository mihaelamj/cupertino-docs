The method that `aSelector` specifies must have one and only one argument (an instance of `NSNotification`).\n- **aName**: The name of the notification to register for delivery to the observer. Specify a notification name to deliver only entries with this notification name.\n\nWhen `nil`, the sender doesn’t use notification names as criteria for the delivery.\n- **anObject**: The object that sends notifications to the observer. Specify a notification sender to deliver only notifications from this sender.\n\nWhen `nil`, the notification center doesn’t use sender names as criteria for delivery.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUnregister an observer to stop receiving notifications.\n\nTo unregister an observer, use `NotificationCenter\/removeObserver(_:)` or [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NotificationCenter\/removeObserver(_:name:object:)] with the most specific detail possible.
