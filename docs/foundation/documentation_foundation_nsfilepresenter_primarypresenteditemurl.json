For example, a subtitle file, by convention, has the same name as its corresponding movie file, but with a different filename extension. If a movie player is sandboxed, an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSOpenPanel] object will grant access only to the user-selected movie file (the primary item) and not its associated subtitle file (the secondary item).\n\nTo gain access to a secondary item, first register an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSFilePresenter] object for it. At any point in its existence, a secondary item must be able to return an [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSURL] object to its primary item. This is done by using this property.  When done accessing the secondary item, unregister the file presenter object.",
