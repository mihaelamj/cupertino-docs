This value must not exceed the length of `bytes`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA data object initialized by adding to it `length` bytes of data from the buffer `bytes`. The returned object might be different than the original receiver.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe returned object takes ownership of the `bytes` pointer and frees it on deallocation. Therefore, `bytes` must point to a memory block allocated with `malloc`.\n\n## Creating Data\n\n- **init(bytes:length:)**: Initializes a data object filled with a given number of bytes copied from a given buffer.\n- **init(bytesNoCopy:length:deallocator:)**: Initializes a data object filled with a given number of bytes of data from a given buffer, with a custom deallocator block.\n- **init(bytesNoCopy:length:freeWhenDone:)**: Initializes a newly allocated data object by adding the given number of bytes from the given buffer.\n- **init(data:)**: Initializes a data object with the contents of another data object.\n\n",
