The `QCCompositionRepository` class cannot be subclassed.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nclass QCCompositionRepository\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nCompositions in the repository are represented by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCComposition] class. You can use the methods of the `QCCompositionRepository` class to fetch all compositions or only those that meet specific criteria.\n\n## Getting the Composition Repository\n\n- **shared()**: Returns the shared instance of the composition repository.\n\n## Fetching Compositions\n\n- **composition(withIdentifier:)**: Returns the composition that corresponds to the identifier.\n- **compositions(withProtocols:andAttributes:)**: Returns an array of compositions that match a set of criteria.\n- **allCompositions()**: Returns an array that contains all compositions currently in the composition repository.\n\n## Classes\n\n- **QCComposition**: The `QCComposition` class represents a Quartz Composer composition that either:\n- **QCCompositionLayer**: A layer that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions in a Core Animation layer hierarchy.\n- **QCCompositionParameterView**: A class that allows users to edit the input parameters of a composition in real time. The composition can be rendering in any of the following objects: [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCRenderer], [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCView], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCCompositionLayer].\n- **QCCompositionPickerPanel**: The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class represents a utility window that allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository and, if supported, preview the composition. The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class cannot be subclassed.\n- **QCCompositionPickerView**: The `QCCompositionPickerView` class allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository, and to preview them. You can set the default input parameters for a composition preview  by using the method setDefaultValue:forInputKey:.\n- **QCPatchController**\n- **QCPlugIn**: A base class to subclass for writing custom patches.\n- **QCPlugInViewController**: The `QCPlugInViewController` class communicates (through Cocoa bindings) between a custom patch and the view used for the internal settings of the custom patch. Only custom patches that use internal settings exposed to the user need to use the `QCPlugInViewController` class.\n- **QCRenderer**: A base class for low-level rendering.\n- **QCView**: The `QCView` class is a custom `NSView` class that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions. It is an autonomous view that is driven by an internal timer running on the main thread.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSObjectProtocol\n\n",
