A *composition protocol*  defines a set of required and optional input parameters and output results.\n\nMany methods of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCRenderer], [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCCompositionLayer], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCView] classes take a `QCComposition` object as a parameter.\n\n## Creating a Composition\n\n- **init(file:)**: Returns a composition object initialized with a Quartz Composer composition file.\n- **init(data:)**: Returns a composition object  initialized with the contents of a Quartz Composer composition file.\n\n## Getting Information About a Composition\n\n- **attributes()**: Returns the attributes of the composition.\n- **protocols()**: Returns the list of protocols to which the composition conforms.\n- **identifier()**: Returns the unique and persistent identifier for the composition from the composition repository.\n\n## Getting Port Keys\n\n- **inputKeys()**: Returns an array listing the keys that identify the input ports of the root patch of the composition.\n- **outputKeys()**: Returns an array listing the keys that identify the output ports of the root patch of the composition.\n\n## Constants\n\n- **Attribute Keys**: Attributes of a composition.\n- **Composition Categories**: Categories for compositions.\n- **Standard Protocol Input Keys**: Input ports of a composition.\n- **Standard Protocol Output Keys**: Output ports of a composition.\n- **Standard Protocols**: Protocols for a composition.\n\n## Classes\n\n- **QCCompositionLayer**: A layer that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions in a Core Animation layer hierarchy.\n- **QCCompositionParameterView**: A class that allows users to edit the input parameters of a composition in real time. The composition can be rendering in any of the following objects: [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCRenderer], [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCView], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCCompositionLayer].\n- **QCCompositionPickerPanel**: The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class represents a utility window that allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository and, if supported, preview the composition. The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class cannot be subclassed.\n- **QCCompositionPickerView**: The `QCCompositionPickerView` class allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository, and to preview them. You can set the default input parameters for a composition preview  by using the method setDefaultValue:forInputKey:.\n- **QCCompositionRepository**: The `QCCompositionRepository` class represents a system-wide centralized repository of built-in and installed Quartz Composer compositions (`\/Library\/Compositions` and `~\/Library\/Compositions`). The `QCCompositionRepository` class cannot be subclassed.\n- **QCPatchController**\n- **QCPlugIn**: A base class to subclass for writing custom patches.\n- **QCPlugInViewController**: The `QCPlugInViewController` class communicates (through Cocoa bindings) between a custom patch and the view used for the internal settings of the custom patch. Only custom patches that use internal settings exposed to the user need to use the `QCPlugInViewController` class.\n- **QCRenderer**: A base class for low-level rendering.\n- **QCView**: The `QCView` class is a custom `NSView` class that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions. It is an autonomous view that is driven by an internal timer running on the main thread.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSCopying\n- NSObjectProtocol\n\n",
