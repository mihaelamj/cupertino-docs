All the KVC keys that represent the internal settings of the custom patch must be listed in its `plugInKeys` method.\n\nThe view controller for a custom patch expects\n\n- the nib file `File's Owner`  class set to the `QCPlugInViewController` class\n- the view outlet connected to the view that contains the editing controls\n\nThe controls are bound to the `File's Owner`  as the target and `plugIn.XXX` as the model key path, where `XXX` is the KVC key for a given internal setting of the custom patch instance.\n\n## Creating a Controller\n\n- **init(plugIn:viewNibName:)**: Creates and initializes a controller for the specified `QCPlugIn` object and nib file.\n\n## Getting the QCPlugIn Object\n\n- **plugIn()**: Returns the `QCPlugIn` object associated with the view controller for the custom patch.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Quartz Composer Custom Patch Programming Guide**\n\n## Classes\n\n- **QCComposition**: The `QCComposition` class represents a Quartz Composer composition that either:\n- **QCCompositionLayer**: A layer that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions in a Core Animation layer hierarchy.\n- **QCCompositionParameterView**: A class that allows users to edit the input parameters of a composition in real time.

The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class cannot be subclassed.\n- **QCCompositionPickerView**: The `QCCompositionPickerView` class allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository, and to preview them. You can set the default input parameters for a composition preview  by using the method setDefaultValue:forInputKey:.\n- **QCCompositionRepository**: The `QCCompositionRepository` class represents a system-wide centralized repository of built-in and installed Quartz Composer compositions (`\/Library\/Compositions` and `~\/Library\/Compositions`).
