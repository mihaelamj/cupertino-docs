The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class cannot be subclassed.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\n@MainActor class QCCompositionPickerPanel\n```\n\n## Creating the Utility Window for Browsing Compositions\n\n- **shared()**: Returns the shared instance of the composition picker panel.\n\n## Getting the Picker Panel View\n\n- **compositionPickerView()**: Returns the composition picker view used by the panel so that it can be configured.\n\n## Classes\n\n- **QCComposition**: The `QCComposition` class represents a Quartz Composer composition that either:\n- **QCCompositionLayer**: A layer that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions in a Core Animation layer hierarchy.\n- **QCCompositionParameterView**: A class that allows users to edit the input parameters of a composition in real time. The composition can be rendering in any of the following objects: [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCRenderer], [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCView], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCCompositionLayer].\n- **QCCompositionPickerView**: The `QCCompositionPickerView` class allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository, and to preview them. You can set the default input parameters for a composition preview  by using the method setDefaultValue:forInputKey:.\n- **QCCompositionRepository**: The `QCCompositionRepository` class represents a system-wide centralized repository of built-in and installed Quartz Composer compositions (`\/Library\/Compositions` and `~\/Library\/Compositions`). The `QCCompositionRepository` class cannot be subclassed.\n- **QCPatchController**\n- **QCPlugIn**: A base class to subclass for writing custom patches.\n- **QCPlugInViewController**: The `QCPlugInViewController` class communicates (through Cocoa bindings) between a custom patch and the view used for the internal settings of the custom patch. Only custom patches that use internal settings exposed to the user need to use the `QCPlugInViewController` class.\n- **QCRenderer**: A base class for low-level rendering.\n- **QCView**: The `QCView` class is a custom `NSView` class that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions. It is an autonomous view that is driven by an internal timer running on the main thread.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSPanel\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSAccessibilityElementProtocol\n- NSAccessibilityProtocol\n- NSAnimatablePropertyContainer\n- NSAppearanceCustomization\n- NSCoding\n- NSMenuItemValidation\n- NSObjectProtocol\n- NSStandardKeyBindingResponding\n- NSTouchBarProvider\n- NSUserActivityRestoring\n- NSUserInterfaceItemIdentification\n- NSUserInterfaceValidations\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
