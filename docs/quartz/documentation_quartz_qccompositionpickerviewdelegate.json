This protocol is adopted by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCRenderer], [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCView], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCCompositionLayer] classes.\n- **QCPlugInContext**: The `QCPlugInContext` protocol defines methods that you use only from within the execution method ([doc:\/\/com.apple.quartz\/documentation\/Quartz\/QCPlugIn\/execute(_:atTime:withArguments:)]) of a `QCPlugIn` object.\n- **QCPlugInInputImageSource**: The `QCPlugInInputImageSource` protocol eliminates the need to use explicit image types for the image input ports on your custom patch. Not only does using the protocol avoid restrictions of a specific image type, but it avoids impedance mismatches, and provides better performance by deferring pixel computation until it is needed. When you need to access the pixels in an image, you simply convert the image to a representation (texture or buffer) using one of the methods defined by the `QCPlugInInputImageSource` protocol. Use a texture representation when you want to use input images on the GPU. Use a buffer representation when you want to use input images on the CPU.\n- **QCPlugInOutputImageProvider**: The `QCPlugInOuputImageProvider` protocol eliminates the need to use explicit image types for the image output ports on a custom patch. The methods in this protocol are called by the Quartz Composer engine when the output image is needed. If your custom patch has an image output port, you need to implement the appropriate methods for rendering image data and to supply information about the rendering destination and the image bounds.\n\n",
