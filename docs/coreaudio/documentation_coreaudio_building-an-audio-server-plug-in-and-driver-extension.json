The sample provides C++ implementations of the plug-in and the Driver Extension, and shows how to implement the communication between the two, including discovering, connecting to, and calling into the Driver Extension from the plug-in.\n\nThe sample implements a dynamic environment that supports multiple audio devices. The plug-in’s audio devices provide the following features:\n\n- Configurable device master volume.\n- Support for 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz sample rates\n- Support for two channels of audio I\/O in 32-bit, floating point, linear PCM format\n\n### Configure the Sample Code Project\n\nTo deploy the sample driver, you need to create an explicit App ID and provisioning profile with the following entitlements:\n\n- com.apple.developer.driverkit\n- com.apple.developer.driverkit.transport.usb\n\nTo learn how to perform this configuration, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DriverKit\/requesting-entitlements-for-driverkit-development].\n\nTo bypass this configuration and use ad hoc signing to test the driver in your local development environment, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) on your system so it recognizes ad hoc-signed DriverKit extensions. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/disabling-and-enabling-system-integrity-protection].\n2. Configure the `SimpleAudioDriver`  target to use local signing. Select the target, and then select its Build Settings tab. Find the Code Signing Identity build setting and select Sign to Run Locally.\n\nUse the included installer script to install the driver on your system. Navigate to the root of the sample project and run the following command:\n\n`.\/Scripts\/install.sh`\n\nReboot your computer so that the system recognizes the driver. After your computer restarts, open Audio MIDI Setup to inspect the newly installed device.\n\nTo uninstall the driver, run the `uninstall.sh` script and reboot your computer.\n\n## Drivers\n\n- **Creating an Audio Server Driver Plug-in**: Build a virtual audio device by creating a custom driver plug-in.\n- **Capturing system audio with Core Audio taps**: Use a Core Audio tap to capture outgoing audio from a process or group of processes.\n\n",
