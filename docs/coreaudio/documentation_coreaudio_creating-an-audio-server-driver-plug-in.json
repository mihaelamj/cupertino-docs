Written in standard C, the sample provides the minimal implementation you need to publish a single, functioning audio device to the system. The audio device provides the following features:\n\n- Configurable device primary volume, muting, and data sources\n- 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz sample rates\n- Two channels of audio I\/O in 32-bit, floating point, linear PCM format\n\nInstall the sample’s `.driver` bundle to `\/Library\/Audio\/Plug-Ins\/HAL` and reboot your computer. Use Audio MIDI Setup to inspect the newly installed device.\n\n## Drivers\n\n- **Building an Audio Server Plug-in and Driver Extension**: Create a plug-in and driver extension to support an audio device in macOS.\n- **Capturing system audio with Core Audio taps**: Use a Core Audio tap to capture outgoing audio from a process or group of processes.\n\n",
