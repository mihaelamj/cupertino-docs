It also synchonizes the clocks of its subdevices and subtaps when running IO to ensure streams are aligned.\n- **AudioHardwareBox**: Instances of the AudioHardwareBox class encapsulate a single audio box, which is a container for other objects (typically device objects). A box publishes identifying information about itself and can be enabled or disabled. A box’s contents are only available to the system when the box is enabled.\n- **AudioHardwareClock**: Instances of the AudioHardwareClock class encapsulate individual audio clocks. All audio devices inherit from the audio clock class, which provides several base properties and contains a list of control objects. Clock objects can be used as a time source when run in an aggregate device, but contain no IO streams.\n- **AudioHardwareControl**: Instances of the AudioHardwareControl class encapsulate a single audio control, which provides properties that describe\/manipulate a particular aspect of the owning object such as gain, mute, data source selection, etc.\n- **AudioHardwareDevice**: Instances of the AudioHardwareDevice class encapsulate individual audio devices. An audio device serves as the basic unit of IO. AudioHardwareDevice provides properties and methods to access and manipulate a device’s state and run IO.\n- **AudioHardwareObject**: The audio HAL provides an abstraction through which applications can access audio hardware. To do this, the HAL provides a small set of audio objects that provide access to the various pieces of the system. Audio objects all have a set of properties that describe and manipulate their state. AudioHardwareObject is a base class for all other audio objects. As such, all classes inherit this set of properties.\n- **AudioHardwarePlugin**: Instances of the AudioHardwarePlugin class encapsulate a single audio HAL plugin, which is a CFBundle loaded by the HAL as a driver to implement device-specific properties and routines.\n- **AudioHardwareProcess**: Instances of the AudioHardwareProcess class encapsulate a single audio process, which contains information about a client process connected to the HAL.\n- **AudioHardwareStream**: Instances of the AudioHardwareStream class encapsulate a single audio stream, which represents a single buffer of data for transferring across the user\/kernel boundary. As such, AudioStreams are the gatekeepers of format information. Each has its own format and list of available formats.\n- **AudioHardwareSystem**: The audio objects in the HAL are arranged in a containment hierarchy. The root of the hierarchy is the one and only instance of the system class. The properties of the AudioHardwareSystem describe the process global settings such as the various default devices. The system object also contains all the devices that are available.\n- **AudioHardwareTap**: Instances of the AudioHardwareTap class encapsulate a single audio tap, which can capture outgoing audio from a process or group of processes, and be used as an input stream source in an aggregate device.\n- **CATapDescription**\n\n## Protocols\n\n- **PropertyListenerDelegate**: A delegate protocol for receiving notifications when properties registered with AudioHardwareObject.addPropertyListener change.\n\n## Structures\n\n- **AudioHardwareError**: Represents errors returned by the HAL\n- **ManagedAudioChannelLayout**: This structure is used to specify channel layouts in files and hardware.\n\n## Variables\n\n- **kAudioDevicePropertyWantsControlsRestored**\n- **kAudioDevicePropertyWantsStreamFormatsRestored**\n\n",
