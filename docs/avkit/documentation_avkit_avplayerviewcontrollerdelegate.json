AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate\n\n**Protocol**\n\nA protocol that defines the methods to implement to respond to player view controller events.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nprotocol AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate : NSObjectProtocol\n```\n\n## Dismissing the Player View Controller\n\n- **playerViewControllerShouldDismiss(_:)**: Asks the delegate object whether the player view controller dismisses itself upon request.\n- **playerViewControllerWillBeginDismissalTransition(_:)**: Tells the delegate when the player view controller is about to start its dismissal transition.\n- **playerViewControllerDidEndDismissalTransition(_:)**: Tells the delegate when the player view controller ends its dismissal transition.\n\n## Responding to Picture in Picture Life Cycle Events\n\n- **playerViewControllerShouldAutomaticallyDismissAtPictureInPictureStart(_:)**: Asks the delegate whether the player view controller automatically dismisses itself when Picture in Picture starts.\n- **playerViewControllerWillStartPictureInPicture(_:)**: Tells the delegate when Picture in Picture is about to start.\n- **playerViewControllerDidStartPictureInPicture(_:)**: Tells the delegate when Picture in Picture starts.\n- **playerViewController(_:failedToStartPictureInPictureWithError:)**: Tells the delegate when Picture in Picture fails to start.\n- **playerViewControllerWillStopPictureInPicture(_:)**: Tells the delegate when Picture in Picture is about to stop.\n- **playerViewControllerDidStopPictureInPicture(_:)**: Tells the delegate when Picture in Picture stops.\n- **playerViewController(_:restoreUserInterfaceForPictureInPictureStopWithCompletionHandler:)**: Tells the delegate when Picture in Picture is about to stop so you can restore your app’s user interface.\n\n## Responding to Navigation Events\n\n- **playerViewController(_:timeToSeekAfterUserNavigatedFrom:to:)**: Tells the delegate when the user skips, scrubs, or otherwise navigates to a new time and wants to resume playback at the target time.\n- **playerViewController(_:willResumePlaybackAfterUserNavigatedFrom:to:)**: Tells the delegate when the user navigates to a new time and playback is about to begin.\n- **skipToPreviousItem(for:)**: Tells the delegate when the user requests skipping to the previous item in the timeline.\n- **skipToNextItem(for:)**: Tells the delegate when the user requests skipping to the next item in the timeline.\n\n## Responding to Interstitial Content Playback Events\n\n- **playerViewController(_:willPresent:)**: Tells the delegate when the player view controller is about to start playing a range of interstitial content.\n- **playerViewController(_:didPresent:)**: Tells the delegate when the player view controller finishes playing a range of interstitial content.\n\n## Responding to Content Proposals\n\n- **playerViewController(_:shouldPresent:)**: Asks the delegate whether the player view controller presents a content proposal.\n- **playerViewController(_:didAccept:)**: Tells the delegate when the user accepts the proposed content.\n- **playerViewController(_:didReject:)**: Tells the delegate when the user rejects the proposed content.\n\n## Responding to Media Selection\n\n- **playerViewController(_:didSelect:in:)**: Tells the delegate when the user selects a media option from a media selection group.\n\n## Responding to Transport Bar Changes\n\n- **playerViewController(_:willTransitionToVisibilityOfTransportBar:with:)**: Tells the delegate when the transport bar’s visibility is about to change.\n- **AVPlayerViewControllerAnimationCoordinator**: A protocol that defines the methods to implement to synchronize animations with playback controls’ visibility animation.\n\n## Responding to Channel Changes\n\n- **playerViewController(_:skipToNextChannel:)**: Tells the delegate when the user wants to skip to the next channel.\n- **playerViewController(_:skipToPreviousChannel:)**: Tells the delegate when the user wants to skip to the previous channel.\n- **nextChannelInterstitialViewController(for:)**: Asks the delegate for a view controller that describes the layout of the next channel’s interstitial view.\n- **previousChannelInterstitialViewController(for:)**: Asks the delegate for a view controller that describes the layout of the previous channel’s interstitial view.\n\n## Responding to Full-Screen Presentations\n\n- **playerViewController(_:willBeginFullScreenPresentationWithAnimationCoordinator:)**: Tells the delegate when the player view controller is about to start full-screen display.\n- **playerViewController(_:willEndFullScreenPresentationWithAnimationCoordinator:)**: Tells the delegate when the player view controller is about to end full-screen display.\n- **playerViewController(_:restoreUserInterfaceForFullScreenExitWithCompletionHandler:)**: Tells the delegate to restore the app’s user interface after returning from a full-screen presentation.\n\n## iOS playback and capture\n\n- **Playing video content in a standard user interface**: Play media full screen, embedded inline, or in a floating Picture in Picture (PiP) window using a player view controller.\n- **AVPlayerViewController**: A view controller that displays content from a player and presents a native user interface to control playback.\n- **AVCaptureEventInteraction**: An object that registers handlers to respond to capture events from system hardware buttons.\n- **AVCaptureEvent**: An object that describes a user interaction with a system hardware button.\n- **AVCaptureEventSound**: A sound object for a capture event.\n- **AVInputPickerInteraction**: Use `AVInputPickerInteraction` to present an input picker.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObjectProtocol\n\n",
