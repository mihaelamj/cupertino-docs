  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nMedia apps presenting serialized content, such as a TV show, often display a preview of the next episode in the series when you finish watching the current one. The user interface for this preview usually contains artwork and information about the proposed content. It also includes options for the user to either watch the next episode or return to the main menu. You add this functionality to your app using AVKit’s content proposals.\n\n### Create a Content Proposal\n\nYou create a content proposal using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVContentProposal] class. This type models the data about the proposed content, such as its title, preview image, metadata, and content URL, and the time at which to present the proposal. You create and configure a content proposal instance as shown in the following code:\n\n### Create the Content Proposal’s User Interface\n\nIn addition to defining your content proposal’s data, you also need to create an interface to present this data to the user. You create this interface by subclassing the AVKit framework’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVContentProposalViewController] class. At runtime, the system passes your subclass a reference to the current [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVContentProposal], providing you the data to present. Your user interface should provide visual and descriptive information about the proposed content, and should also include options for the user to accept or reject the proposal.\n\nWhen the system presents your proposal, it displays it over the currently playing full-screen video. You may want to scale this video to a smaller size so you can make more room to display the details of the proposed content. To do this, you override the view controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVContentProposalViewController\/preferredPlayerViewFrame] property and return the desired video frame.\n\nWhen the system presents the proposal, the player’s view automatically animates to the specified frame.\n\n### Add Controls to the Content Proposal\n\nYour presented user interface should also provide controls so the user can accept or reject the proposal. The event handlers for these actions should call the controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVContentProposalViewController\/dismissContentProposal(for:animated:completion:)] method, indicating the user’s choice.\n\n### Make the Content Proposal Eligible to be Presented\n\nTo make your content proposal eligible for the system to present, set it as the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem\/nextContentProposal] property value of the current [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem]. The following example shows how to configure this property value in a playback app that manages a queue of `Video` objects, which is a custom value type that models the data of an individual video in the queue. The example code creates the required playback objects, creates a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVContentProposal] for the next video in the queue, and sets the video as the player item’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem\/nextContentProposal].\n\n### Present the Content Proposal\n\nWith the content proposal set as the player item’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem\/nextContentProposal], the next step is to implement the methods of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate] protocol. You use these methods to define how the system presents the content proposal, as well as to handle the acceptance or rejection of the proposed content.\n\nTo present your custom view controller in response to a request to present the next content proposal, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate\/playerViewController(_:shouldPresent:)] method. In this method, you set an instance of your custom [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVContentProposalViewController] as the player view controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController\/contentProposalViewController] property.\n\nIf the presented [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVContentProposal] provides a valid content URL, the player view controller can automatically handle its acceptance or rejection. However, if you need more control over the handling of these actions, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate\/playerViewController(_:didAccept:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate\/playerViewController(_:didReject:)] methods. For example, the following code implements the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate\/playerViewController(_:didAccept:)]method to play the proposed video and create a new content proposal for the next video in the queue.",
