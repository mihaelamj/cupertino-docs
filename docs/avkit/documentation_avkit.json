complete with transport controls, chapter navigation, picture-in-picture support, and display of subtitles and closed captions.\n\n## iOS playback and capture\n\n- **Playing video content in a standard user interface**: Play media full screen, embedded inline, or in a floating Picture in Picture (PiP) window using a player view controller.\n- **AVPlayerViewController**: A view controller that displays content from a player and presents a native user interface to control playback.\n- **AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate**: A protocol that defines the methods to implement to respond to player view controller events.\n- **AVCaptureEventInteraction**: An object that registers handlers to respond to capture events from system hardware buttons.\n- **AVCaptureEvent**: An object that describes a user interaction with a system hardware button.\n- **AVCaptureEventSound**: A sound object for a capture event.\n- **AVInputPickerInteraction**: Use `AVInputPickerInteraction` to present an input picker.\n\n## tvOS playback and capture\n\n- **Customizing the tvOS Playback Experience**: Adopt the latest features of the redesigned tvOS player user interface to provide a more streamlined way to watch your content.\n- **Presenting Navigation Markers**: Present navigation markers in the Chapters panel to help users quickly navigate your content.\n- **Working with Interstitial Content**: Present additional content alongside your main media presentation using HTTP Live Streaming support.\n- **Presenting Content Proposals in tvOS**: Display a preview of an upcoming media item at the conclusion of the currently playing media item.\n- **Working with Overlays and Parental Controls in tvOS**: Add interactive overlays, parental controls, and livestream channel flipping using a player view controller.\n- **Supporting Continuity Camera in your tvOS app**: Capture high-quality photos, video, and audio in your Apple TV app by connecting an iPhone or iPad as a continuity device.\n- **AVPlayerViewController**: A view controller that displays content from a player and presents a native user interface to control playback.\n- **AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate**: A protocol that defines the methods to implement to respond to player view controller events.\n- **AVInterstitialTimeRange**: A time range in an audiovisual presentation for content with an interstitial designation, such as advertisements or legal notices.\n- **AVNavigationMarkersGroup**: A set of markers for navigating playback of an audiovisual presentation.\n- **AVContentProposalViewController**: A view controller that proposes content to watch next.\n- **AVDisplayManager**: A tvOS management object that controls whether a TV switches modes to match the video’s native mode.\n- **AVContinuityDevicePickerViewController**: A view controller that provides an interface to a person so they can select and connect a continuity device to the system.\n- **AVContinuityDevicePickerViewControllerDelegate**: An interface that responds to events from a continuity device picker view controller.\n\n## visionOS playback\n\n- **Playing immersive media with AVKit**: Adopt the system playback interface to provide an immersive video watching experience.\n- **Creating a multiview video playback experience in visionOS**: Build an interface that plays multiple videos simultaneously and handles transitions to different experience types gracefully.\n- **Adopting the system player interface in visionOS**: Provide an optimized viewing experience for watching 3D video content.\n- **Trimming and exporting media in visionOS**: Display standard controls in your app to edit the timeline of the currently playing media.\n- **AVPlayerViewController**: A view controller that displays content from a player and presents a native user interface to control playback.\n- **AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate**: A protocol that defines the methods to implement to respond to player view controller events.\n- **AVExperienceController**: An object that controls video experiences.\n- **AVMultiviewManager**: An object that manages viewing multiple videos at once.\n- **AVGroupExperienceCoordinator**: An object that synchronizes viewing environment state across participants in a SharePlay session.\n\n## macOS playback and capture\n\n- **Implementing Trimming in a macOS Player**: Provide a QuickTime media-trimming experience in your macOS app.\n- **AVPlayerView**: A view that displays content from a player and presents a native user interface to control playback.\n- **AVCaptureView**: A view that displays standard user interface controls for capturing media data.\n\n## Multiplatform playback and capture\n\n- **VideoPlayer**: A view that displays content from a player and a native user interface to control playback.\n\n## Picture in Picture\n\n- **Adopting Picture in Picture Playback in tvOS**: Add advanced multitasking capabilities to your video apps by using Picture in Picture playback in tvOS.\n- **Adopting Picture in Picture in a Standard Player**: Add Picture in Picture (PiP) playback to your app using a player view controller.\n- **Adopting Picture in Picture in a Custom Player**: Add controls to your custom player user interface to invoke Picture in Picture (PiP) playback.\n- **Adopting Picture in Picture for video calls**: Add multitasking capability to your video-call apps by using Picture in Picture (PiP).\n- **Accessing the camera while multitasking on iPad**: Operate the camera in Split View, Slide Over, Picture in Picture, and Stage Manager modes.\n- **AVPictureInPictureController**: A controller that responds to user-initiated Picture in Picture playback of video in a floating, resizable window.\n\n## Playback route selection\n\n- **AVRoutePickerView**: A view that presents a list of nearby media receivers.\n\n## Metadata\n\n- **AVKit Metadata Identifiers**: Additional metadata that an asset contains.\n\n## Errors\n\n- **AVKitErrorDomain**: The domain of errors the framework generates.\n- **AVKitError**: A structure that represents a framework error.\n- **AVKitError.Code**: Constants that identify framework error codes.\n\n## Macros\n\n- **Macros**\n\n",
