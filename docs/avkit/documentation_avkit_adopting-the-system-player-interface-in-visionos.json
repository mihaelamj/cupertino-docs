  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe recommended way to provide a video playback interface for your visionOS app is to adopt [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController]. Using this class makes it simple to provide the same playback user interface and features found in system apps like TV and Music. It also provides essential system integration to deliver an optimal viewing experience whether you’re playing standard 2D content or immersive 3D video with spatial audio. This article describes best practices for presenting the player in visionOS and covers the options the player provides to customize its user interface to best fit your app.\n\n### Explore presentation options\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController] to play video in windowed environments in visionOS. It automatically adapts its user interface to best fit its presentation. For example, when you present it nested inside another view, it displays an inline user interface:\n\n\n\nPresent the player in full-screen mode by setting it as the exclusive root view of your app, or by presenting it using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/fullScreenCover(item:onDismiss:content:)] modifier. In full-screen mode, the player presents a more content-forward design that dims the environment by default to provide more suitable viewing. This provides a streamlined viewing experience for both 2D and 3D content.\n\n\n\n### Display supporting metadata\n\nThe user interface displays a title view above the transport bar when the current player item contains title and subtitle metadata. When playing live-streaming content, the title view may also display a badge to indicate the content state to the viewer.\n\n\n\nThe title view displays the values of an asset’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVMetadataIdentifier\/commonIdentifierTitle] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVMetadataIdentifier\/iTunesMetadataTrackSubTitle] metadata items, when available. If your media doesn’t provide embedded metadata, you can add supplemental metadata to display by creating instances of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVMetadataItem]. The table below lists the metadata values the player user interface supports.\n\nIn an app that defines a simple structure to hold string and data items, you can map its values to their appropriate metadata identifiers and build an array of metadata items:\n\nTo apply the metadata to the current player item, set the array of metadata items as the value of the player item’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/AVPlayerItem\/externalMetadata] property:\n\nOnly the title and subtitle values display in the title view. The player presents the other supported metadata values in its Info tab, which the section below describes.\n\n### Display custom informational views\n\nThe visionOS player UI can display one or more content tabs in the user interface to show supporting information or related content. By default, the player presents an Info tab when an asset contains embedded metadata or when you set external metadata on the player item, as the Display supporting metadata section above describes.\n\nYour app can also present custom tabs to show supporting content. You define your tab content as standard SwiftUI views, wrap them in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UIHostingController], and set them as the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController\/customInfoViewControllers] property. The player UI uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/title] property of the hosting controller to display as the tab title in the interface, so set this value before setting it on the player view controller.\n\n\n\n### Present actions in the Info tab\n\nThe player UI presents an Info tab when the asset it displays provides embedded or external metadata. The tab’s view displays the metadata details, and it may show up to two [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIAction] controls along its trailing edge:\n\n\n\nCustomize the actions the view presents by setting a value for the player view controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController\/infoViewActions] property. When playing nonlive content, this property contains a single-element array that presents an action to play the content from the beginning. You can replace the default value (if present), add an additional action, or set this property value to an empty array to display no actions. The example below shows how to add a Add to Favorites action to the view:\n\n### Display actions contextually\n\nYou can use the visionOS player UI to present controls contextually, which your app displays for a specific range of time in the content and then dismiss. A common use for this type of control is a skip button that displays during the title sequence of a movie or TV show. People can tap the button to bypass the introduction and quickly skip to the main content.\n\n\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController] provides a [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController\/contextualActions] property you can use to specify one or more actions to present. The player displays them along the bottom-trailing side of the screen. The following code example shows a simple implementation of an action that seeks the player forward to the time of the main content:\n\nWhen you set a value for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.avkit\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController\/contextualActions] property, the player presents the controls immediately. To present them only during a relevant section of the content, observe the player timing by adding a periodic or boundary time observer. The following example defines a periodic time observer that fires every second during normal playback. In each invocation, it evaluates the new time to determine whether it falls within the presentation range. If it does, the example sets the skip action as the contextual actions value; otherwise, it clears the value by setting it to an empty array.",
