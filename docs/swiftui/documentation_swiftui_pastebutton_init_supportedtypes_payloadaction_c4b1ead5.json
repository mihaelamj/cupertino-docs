If the pasteboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the button becomes disabled.\n- **payloadAction**: The handler to call when the user clicks the Paste button, and the pasteboard has items that conform to `supportedTypes`. This closure receives an array of item providers that you use to inspect and load the pasteboard data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSet the contents of `supportedTypes` in order of your app’s preference for its supported types. The Paste button takes the most-preferred type that the pasteboard source supports and delivers this to the `payloadAction` closure.\n\n## Deprecated initializers\n\n- **init(supportedTypes:validator:payloadAction:)**: Creates a Paste button that accepts specific types of data from the pasteboard, performing a custom validation of the data before sending it to your app.\n- **init(supportedContentTypes:validator:payloadAction:)**: Creates a Paste button that accepts specific types of data from the pasteboard, performing a custom validation of the data before sending it to your app.\n\n",
