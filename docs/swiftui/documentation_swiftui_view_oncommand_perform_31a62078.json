If `action` is `nil`, `command` keeps its association with this view but doesn’t trigger.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that triggers `action` when the `command` occurs.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis view or one of the views it contains must be in focus in order for the action to trigger. Other actions for the same command on views *closer* to the view in focus take priority, potentially overriding this action.\n\n## Responding to commands\n\n- **onMoveCommand(perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to a move command, like when the user presses an arrow key on a Mac keyboard, or taps the edge of the Siri Remote when controlling an Apple TV.\n- **onDeleteCommand(perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Delete command, or pressing either the ⌫ (backspace) or ⌦ (forward delete) keys while the view has focus.\n- **pageCommand(value:in:step:)**: Steps a value through a range in response to page up or page down commands.\n- **onExitCommand(perform:)**: Sets up an action that triggers in response to receiving the exit command while the view has focus.\n- **onPlayPauseCommand(perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Play\/Pause command.\n- **MoveCommandDirection**: Specifies the direction of an arrow key movement.\n\n",
