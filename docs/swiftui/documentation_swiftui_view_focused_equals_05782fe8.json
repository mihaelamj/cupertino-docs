When focus moves to the modified view, the binding sets the bound value to the corresponding match value. If a caller sets the state value programmatically to the matching value, then focus moves to the modified view. When focus leaves the modified view, the binding sets the bound value to `nil`. If a caller sets the value to `nil`, SwiftUI automatically dismisses focus.\n- **value**: The value to match against when determining whether the binding should change.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe modified view.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this modifier to cause the view to receive focus whenever the `binding` equals the `value`. Typically, you create an enumeration of fields that may receive focus, bind an instance of this enumeration, and assign its cases to focusable views.\n\nThe following example uses the cases of a `LoginForm` enumeration to bind the focus state of two [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TextField] views. A sign-in button validates the fields and sets the bound `focusedField` value to any field that requires the user to correct a problem.\n\n```swift\nstruct LoginForm {\n    enum Field: Hashable {\n        case usernameField\n        case passwordField\n    }\n\n    @State private var username = \"\"\n    @State private var password = \"\"\n    @FocusState private var focusedField: Field?\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Form {\n            TextField(\"Username\", text: $username)\n                .focused($focusedField, equals: .usernameField)\n\n            SecureField(\"Password\", text: $password)\n                .focused($focusedField, equals: .passwordField)\n\n            Button(\"Sign In\") {\n                if username.isEmpty {\n                    focusedField = .usernameField\n                } else if password.isEmpty {\n                    focusedField = .passwordField\n                } else {\n                    handleLogin(username, password)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo control focus using a Boolean, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:)] method instead.\n\n## Managing focus state\n\n- **focused(_:)**: Modifies this view by binding its focus state to the given Boolean state value.\n- **isFocused**: Returns whether the nearest focusable ancestor has focus.\n- **FocusState**: A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that SwiftUI updates as the placement of focus within the scene changes.\n- **FocusedValue**: A property wrapper for observing values from the focused view or one of its ancestors.\n- **Entry()**: Creates an environment values, transaction, container values, or focused values entry.\n- **FocusedValueKey**: A protocol for identifier types used when publishing and observing focused values.\n- **FocusedBinding**: A convenience property wrapper for observing and automatically unwrapping state bindings from the focused view or one of its ancestors.\n- **searchFocused(_:)**: Modifies this view by binding the focus state of the search field associated with the nearest searchable modifier to the given Boolean value.\n- **searchFocused(_:equals:)**: Modifies this view by binding the focus state of the search field associated with the nearest searchable modifier to the given value.\n\n",
