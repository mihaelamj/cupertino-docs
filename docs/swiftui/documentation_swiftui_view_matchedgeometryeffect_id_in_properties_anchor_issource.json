New namespaces are created by adding an `@Namespace` variable to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View] type and reading its value in the view’s body method.\n- **properties**: The properties to copy from the source view.\n- **anchor**: The relative location in the view used to produce its shared position value.\n- **isSource**: True if the view should be used as the source of geometry for other views in the group.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new view that defines an entry in the global database of views synchronizing their geometry.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method sets the geometry of each view in the group from the inserted view with `isSource = true` (known as the “source” view), updating the values marked by `properties`.\n\nIf inserting a view in the same transaction that another view with the same key is removed, the system will interpolate their frame rectangles in window space to make it appear that there is a single view moving from its old position to its new position.
