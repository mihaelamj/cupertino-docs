If the drag and drop operation doesn’t contain any of the supported types, then this drop destination doesn’t activate and `isTargeted` doesn’t update.\n- **delegate**: A type that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DropDelegate] protocol. You have comprehensive control over drop behavior when you use a delegate.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that provides a drop destination for a drag operation of the specified types.\n\n## Moving items using item providers\n\n- **itemProvider(_:)**: Provides a closure that vends the drag representation to be used for a particular data element.\n- **onDrag(_:preview:)**: Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.\n- **onDrag(_:)**: Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.\n- **onDrop(of:isTargeted:perform:)**: Defines the destination of a drag-and-drop operation that handles the dropped content with a closure that you specify.\n- **DropDelegate**: An interface that you implement to interact with a drop operation in a view modified to accept drops.\n- **DropProposal**: The behavior of a drop.\n- **DropOperation**: Operation types that determine how a drag and drop session resolves when the user drops a drag item.\n- **DropInfo**: The current state of a drop.\n\n",
