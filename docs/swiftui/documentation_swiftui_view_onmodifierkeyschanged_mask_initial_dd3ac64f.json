The default mask includes all keys.\n- **action**: A closure to receive updates when modifier key press state changes. The closure receives the old and new values as input.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA modified view that updates when hardware modifier keys change.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf a mask is provided, updates will only occur when they involve a change in one of the keys included in the mask. The default mask includes all modifier keys.\n\n```swift\nContentView()\n    .onModifierKeysChanged(mask: .option) { old, new in\n        if new.isEmpty {\n            \/\/ Option key released\n            ...\n        } else {\n            \/\/ Option key pressed\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nWhen the view first appears, SwiftUI will check the state of the modifier keys and call the provided action if any matched keys are pressed.
