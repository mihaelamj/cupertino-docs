The transition will use the animations defined by the effect, but will ignore any delays.\n\nWhen the override expires, the effect will respond to hover events again. If the view isn’t hovered, the effect will remain in the inactive phase. Otherwise it will begin transitioning to the active phase, honoring any delays defined on the effect.\n\nWhen applied to a group, all effects in the group become inactive as well. Applying overrides to multiple effects in the same group is undefined, due to it not being clear which override should be applied.",
