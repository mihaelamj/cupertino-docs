With an ease in animation, the motion starts slowly and increases its speed towards the end.\n\nUse `easeIn(duration:)` when you want to specify the time it takes for the animation to complete. Otherwise, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/easeIn] to perform the animation for a default length of time.\n\nThe following code shows an example of animating the size changes of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] using an ease in animation with a duration of one second.",
