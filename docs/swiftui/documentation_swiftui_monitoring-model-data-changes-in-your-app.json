  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYou typically store and process data in your app using a data model that’s separate from your app’s user interface (UI) and other logic. The separation promotes modularity, improves testability, and makes it easier to reason about how your app works.\n\nTraditionally, you use a view controller to move data back and forth between the model and the UI, but SwiftUI handles most of this synchronization for you. To update views when data changes, you make your data model classes observable objects, publish their properties, and declare instances of them using property wrappers. To ensure user-driven data changes flow back into the model, you bind UI controls to model properties. Working together, these features help you to maintain a single source of truth for your data.\n\n### Make model data observable\n\nTo make the data changes in your model visible to SwiftUI, adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Combine\/ObservableObject] protocol for model classes. For example, you can create a `Book` class that’s an observable object:\n\nThe system automatically infers the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Combine\/ObservableObject\/ObjectWillChangePublisher] associated type for the class and synthesizes the required [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Combine\/ObservableObject\/objectWillChange] method that emits the changed values of published properties. To publish a property, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Combine\/Published] property wrapper to the property’s declaration:\n\nAvoid the overhead of a published property when you don’t need it. Only publish properties that both can change and that matter to the UI. For example, the `Book` class might have an `identifier` property that never changes after initialization:\n\nYou can still display the identifier in your user interface, but because it isn’t published, SwiftUI doesn’t watch that particular property for changes.\n\n### Monitor changes in observable objects\n\nTo tell SwiftUI to monitor an observable object, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ObservedObject] property wrapper to the property’s declaration:\n\nYou can pass individual properties of an observed object to child views, as shown above. When the data changes, like when you load new data from disk, SwiftUI updates all the affected views. You can also pass an entire observable object to a child view and share model objects across levels of a view hierarchy:\n\n### Instantiate a model object in a view\n\nSwiftUI might create or recreate a view at any time, so it’s important that initializing a view with a given set of inputs always results in the same view. As a result, it’s unsafe to create an observed object inside a view. Instead, SwiftUI provides the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/StateObject] property wrapper, which creates a single source of truth for a reference type that you store in a view hierarchy. You can safely create a `Book` instance inside a view this way:\n\nA state object behaves like an observed object, except that SwiftUI creates and manages a single object instance for a given view instance, regardless of how many times it recreates the view. You can use the object locally, or pass the state object into another view’s observed object property, as shown in the above example.\n\nWhile SwiftUI doesn’t recreate the state object within a view, it does create a distinct object instance for each view instance. For example, each `LibraryView` in the following code gets a unique `Book` instance:\n\nYou can also create a state object in your top level [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/App] instance, or in one of your app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Scene] instances. For example, if you define an observable object called `Library` to hold a collection of books for a book reader app, you could create a single library instance in the app’s top level structure:\n\n### Share an object throughout your app\n\nIf you have a data model object that you want to use throughout your app, but don’t want to pass it through many layers of hierarchy, you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/environmentObject(_:)] view modifier to put the object into the environment instead:\n\nAny descendant view of the view to which you apply the modifier can then access the data model instance by declaring a property with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentObject] property wrapper:\n\nIf you use an environment object, you might add it to the view at the top of your app’s hierarchy, as shown above. Alternatively, you might add it to the root view of a subtree in your view hierarchy. Either way, remember to also add it to the preview provider of any view that uses the object, or that has a descendant that uses the object:\n\n### Create a two-way connection using bindings\n\nWhen you allow a person to change the data in the UI, use a binding to the corresponding property. This ensures that updates flow back into the data model automatically. You can get a binding to an observed object, state object, or environment object property by prefixing the name of the object with the dollar sign (`$`). For example, if you let someone edit the title of a book by adding a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TextField] to the `BookEditView`, give the text field a binding to the book’s `title` property:\n\nThe binding connects the view element to the underlying model so that a person makes changes directly to the model data.",
