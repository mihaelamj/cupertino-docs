When a view is being removed, its transition is changed from the `identity` phase to the `didDisappear` phase. If a view is removed while it is still transitioning in, then its phase will change to `didDisappear`. If a view is re-added while it is transitioning out, its phase will change back to `identity`.\n\nIn the `identity` phase, transitions should generally not make any visual change to the view they are applied to, since the transition’s view modifications in the `identity` phase will be applied to the view as long as it is visible. In the `willAppear` and `didDisappear` phases, transitions should apply a change that will be animated to create the transition. If no animatable change is applied, then the transition will be a no-op.",
