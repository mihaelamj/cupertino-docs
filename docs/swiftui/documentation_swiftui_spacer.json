For example, when placed within an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack], a spacer expands horizontally as much as the stack allows, moving sibling views out of the way, within the limits of the stack’s size. SwiftUI sizes a stack that doesn’t contain a spacer up to the combined ideal widths of the content of the stack’s child views.\n\nThe following example provides a simple checklist row to illustrate how you can use a spacer:\n\n```swift\nstruct ChecklistRow: View {\n    let name: String\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack {\n            Image(systemName: \"checkmark\")\n            Text(name)\n        }\n        .border(Color.blue)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nAdding a spacer before the image creates an adaptive view with no content that expands to push the image and text to the right side of the stack. The stack also now expands to take as much space as the parent view allows, shown by the blue border that indicates the boundary of the stack:\n\n```swift\nstruct ChecklistRow: View {\n    let name: String\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack {\n            Spacer()\n            Image(systemName: \"checkmark\")\n            Text(name)\n        }\n        .border(Color.blue)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nMoving the spacer between the image and the name pushes those elements to the left and right sides of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack], respectively. Because the stack contains the spacer, it expands to take as much horizontal space as the parent view allows; the blue border indicates its size:\n\n```swift\nstruct ChecklistRow: View {\n    let name: String\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack {\n            Image(systemName: \"checkmark\")\n            Spacer()\n            Text(name)\n        }\n        .border(Color.blue)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nAdding two spacer views on the outside of the stack leaves the image and text together, while the stack expands to take as much horizontal space as the parent view allows:\n\n```swift\nstruct ChecklistRow: View {\n    let name: String\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack {\n            Spacer()\n            Image(systemName: \"checkmark\")\n            Text(name)\n            Spacer()\n        }\n        .border(Color.blue)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Creating a spacer\n\n- **init(minLength:)**\n- **minLength**: The minimum length this spacer can be shrunk to, along the axis or axes of expansion.\n\n## Separators\n\n- **Divider**: A visual element that can be used to separate other content.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- BitwiseCopyable\n- Copyable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n- View\n\n",
