If the drag and drop operation doesn’t contain any of the supported types, then this drop destination doesn’t activate and `isTargeted` doesn’t update.\n- **delegate**: A type that conforms to the `DropDelegate` protocol. You have comprehensive control over drop behavior when you use a delegate.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that provides a drop destination for a drag operation of the specified types.\n\n",
