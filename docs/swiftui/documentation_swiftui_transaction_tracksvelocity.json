This tracking is mutually exclusive with an animation being used during a view change, since if there is an animation, it is responsible for managing its own velocity.\n\nGesture onChanged and updating callbacks automatically set this property to true.\n\nThis example shows an interaction which applies changes, tracking velocity until the final change, which applies an animation (which will start with the velocity that was tracked during the previous changes). These changes could come from a server or from an interactive control like a slider.",
