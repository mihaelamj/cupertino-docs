You can truncate at the beginning, middle, or end of the text view.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that truncates text at different points in a line depending on the mode you select.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse the `truncationMode(_:)` modifier to determine whether text in a long line is truncated at the beginning, middle, or end.
