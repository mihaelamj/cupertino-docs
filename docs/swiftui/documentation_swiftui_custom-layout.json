However, if you need behavior that you can’t achieve with the built-in layout tools, create a custom layout container type using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Layout] protocol. A container that you define asks for the sizes of all its subviews, and then indicates where to place the subviews within its own bounds.\n\n\n\nYou can also create animated transitions among layout types that conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Layout] procotol, including both built-in and custom layouts.\n\nFor design guidance, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/layout] in the Human Interface Guidelines.",
