Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nstatic func interpolatingSpring(mass: Double = 1.0, stiffness: Double, damping: Double, initialVelocity: Double = 0.0) -> Animation\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **mass**: The mass of the object attached to the spring.\n- **stiffness**: The stiffness of the spring.\n- **damping**: The spring damping value.\n- **initialVelocity**: The initial velocity of the spring, as a value in the range [0, 1] representing the magnitude of the value being animated.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA spring animation.\n\n## Customizing spring animations\n\n- **spring**: A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other `spring()` or `interactiveSpring()` animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the response values between springs over a time period.\n- **spring(_:blendDuration:)**: A persistent spring animation.\n- **spring(duration:bounce:blendDuration:)**: A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other `spring()` or `interactiveSpring()` animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the duration values between springs over a time period.\n- **spring(response:dampingFraction:blendDuration:)**: A persistent spring animation. When mixed with other `spring()` or `interactiveSpring()` animations on the same property, each animation will be replaced by their successor, preserving velocity from one animation to the next. Optionally blends the response values between springs over a time period.\n- **interactiveSpring**: A convenience for a `spring` animation with a lower `duration` value, intended for driving interactive animations.\n- **interactiveSpring(response:dampingFraction:blendDuration:)**: A convenience for a `spring` animation with a lower `response` value, intended for driving interactive animations.\n- **interpolatingSpring**: An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.\n- **interpolatingSpring(_:initialVelocity:)**: An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range of one to zero.\n- **interpolatingSpring(duration:bounce:initialVelocity:)**: An interpolating spring animation that uses a damped spring model to produce values in the range [0, 1] that are then used to interpolate within the [from, to] range of the animated property. Preserves velocity across overlapping animations by adding the effects of each animation.\n\n",
