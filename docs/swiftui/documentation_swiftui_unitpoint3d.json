The point stores a value in each dimension that indicates the fraction of the view’s size in that dimension — measured from the view’s origin — where the point appears. For example, you can create a unit point that represents the center of any view by using the value `0.5` for each dimension:\n\nTo project the unit point into the rendered view’s coordinate space, multiply each component of the unit point with the corresponding component of the view’s size:\n\nYou can perform this calculation yourself if you happen to know a view’s size, or if you want to use a unit point for some custom purpose, but SwiftUI typically does this for you to carry out operations that you request, like when you rotate a view with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/rotation3DEffect(_:anchor:)] modifier and indicate the anchor point that you want to rotate the view around.\n\nYou can create custom unit points with explicit values, like the example above, or you can use one of the built-in unit points that SwiftUI provides, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UnitPoint3D\/zero], [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UnitPoint3D\/center], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UnitPoint3D\/topTrailing].
