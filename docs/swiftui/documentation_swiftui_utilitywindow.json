Because of this role, they have specialized behavior compared to all other windows:\n\n- They receive `FocusedValues` from the focused main scene in an application, similar to commands in the main menu, which can be used to display information on the active content as the user focuses on different scenes.\n- They have a default window level of `.floating` so they remain visible when moving focus between the main scenes.\n- They hide when the window is no longer active.\n- They only become focused when explicitly needed, such as clicking in the titlebar or on a focusable view.\n- When focused, they can be dismissed with the Escape key.\n- They are not minimizable by default.\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct PhotoBrowser: App {\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            PhotoGallery()\n        }\n\n        UtilityWindow(\"Photo Info\", id: \"photo-info\") {\n            PhotoInfoViewer()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct PhotoInfoViewer: View {\n    \/\/ Automatically updates to the photo selection from whichever\n    \/\/ photo gallery window is focused.\n    @FocusedValue(PhotoSelection.self) private var selectedPhotos\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Text(\"\\(selectedPhotos.count) photos selected\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`UtilityWindow` will automatically add a menu item to show\/hide itself in the “View” menu. This can be removed by applying [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Scene\/commandsRemoved()] to the utility window, and manually placing a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WindowVisibilityToggle] elsewhere in an app’s commands.
