You might be able to improve performance by setting this value to `true`, but then drawing a non-opaque image into the context produces undefined results. The default is `false`.\n- **colorMode**: A working color space and storage format of the canvas. The default is [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ColorRenderingMode\/nonLinear].\n- **rendersAsynchronously**: A Boolean that indicates whether the canvas can present its contents to its parent view asynchronously. The default is `false`.\n- **renderer**: A closure in which you conduct immediate mode drawing. The closure takes two inputs: a context that you use to issue drawing commands and a size — representing the current size of the canvas — that you can use to customize the content. The canvas calls the renderer any time it needs to redraw the content.\n- **symbols**: A [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ViewBuilder] that you use to supply SwiftUI views to the canvas for use during drawing. Uniquely tag each view using the `View\/tag(_:)` modifier, so that you can find them from within your renderer using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GraphicsContext\/resolveSymbol(id:)] method.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis initializer behaves like the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Canvas\/init(opaque:colorMode:rendersAsynchronously:renderer:)] initializer, except that you also provide a collection of SwiftUI views for the renderer to use as drawing elements.\n\nSwiftUI stores a rendered version of each child view that you specify in the `symbols` view builder and makes these available to the canvas.
