Call the method on the first view’s preferences instance, and provide the second view’s preferences instance as input.\n\nFor example, consider two views that appear in a custom horizontal stack. The following distance call gets the preferred spacing between these views, where `spacing1` contains the preferences of a first view, and `spacing2` contains the preferences of a second view:\n\nThe method first determines, based on the axis and the ordering, that the views abut on the trailing edge of the first view and the leading edge of the second. It then gets the spacing preferences for the corresponding edges of each view, and returns the greater of the two values. This results in the smallest value that provides enough space to satisfy the preferences of both views.",
