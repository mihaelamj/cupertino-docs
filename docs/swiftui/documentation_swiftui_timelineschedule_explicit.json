If the dates you provide are in the past, the timeline view updates exactly once with the last entry. If you only provide dates in the future, the timeline view renders with the current date until the first date arrives. If you provide one or more dates in the past and one or more in the future, the view renders the most recent past date, refreshing normally on all subsequent dates.",
