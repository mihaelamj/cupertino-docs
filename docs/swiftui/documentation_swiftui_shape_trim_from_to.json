Use the `trim(from:to:)` method to draw a portion of a shape by ignoring portions of the beginning and ending of the shape’s path.\n\nFor example, if you’re drawing a figure eight or infinity symbol (∞) starting from its center, setting the `startFraction` and `endFraction` to different values determines the parts of the overall shape.\n\nThe following example shows a simplified infinity symbol that draws only three quarters of the full shape. That is, of the two lobes of the symbol, one lobe is complete and the other is half complete.\n\nChanging the parameters of `trim(from:to:)` to `.trim(from: 0, to: 1)` draws the full infinity symbol, while `.trim(from: 0, to: 0.5)` draws only the left lobe of the symbol.",
