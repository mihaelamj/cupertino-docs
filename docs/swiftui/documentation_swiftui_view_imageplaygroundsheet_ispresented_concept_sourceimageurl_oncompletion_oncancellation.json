The person viewing the creation UI can edit the concepts from inside that UI. `concept: str` is equivalent to `concepts: [.text(str)]`.\n- **sourceImageURL**: A file URL that refers to the image to use as the starting point for creating the new image. The person viewing the sheet can override the image you provide, and choose different images and concepts inside the creation UI. If you don’t provide a starting image, the system creates the new image.\n- **onCompletion**: The block to receive the created image. The block has no return value and receives the following parameter:\n\n\n- **onCancellation**: The block to execute when the person exits. the creation UI without choosing an image. After executing this block, the system automatically dismisses the sheet.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAdd this modifier to a view to display the system’s image-creation sheet.
