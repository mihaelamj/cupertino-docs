  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nUse this initializer to create a view that shows continuous progress within a date range. The following example initializes a progress view with a range of `start...end`, where `start` is 30 seconds in the past and `end` is 90 seconds in the future. As a result, the progress view begins at 25 percent complete. This example also provides a custom descriptive label.\n\n\n\nBy default, the progress view empties as time passes from the start of the date range to the end, but you can use the `countsDown` parameter to create a progress view that fills as time passes, as the above example demonstrates.\n\nThe progress view provided by this initializer uses a text label that automatically updates to describe the current time remaining. To provide a custom label to show the current value, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ProgressView\/init(value:total:label:currentValueLabel:)] instead.",
