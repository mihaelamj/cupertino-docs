  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nInterfaces across Apple platforms feature a new dynamic material called Liquid Glass, which combines the optical properties of glass with a sense of fluidity. Liquid Glass is a material that blurs content behind it, reflects color and light of surrounding content, and reacts to touch and pointer interactions in real time. Standard components in SwiftUI use Liquid Glass. Adopt Liquid Glass on custom components to move, combine, and morph them into one another with unique animations and transitions.\n\n\n\nTo learn about Liquid Glass and more, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Landmarks-Building-an-app-with-Liquid-Glass].\n\n## Apply and configure Liquid Glass effects\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/glassEffect(_:in:)] modifier to add Liquid Glass effects to a view. By default, the modifier uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Glass\/regular] variant of [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Glass] and applies the given effect within a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Capsule] shape behind the view’s content.\n\nConfigure the effect to customize your components in a variety of ways:\n\nIn the examples below, observe how to apply Liquid Glass effects to a view, use an alternate shape with a specific corner radius, and create a tinted view that responds to interactivity:\n\n## Combine multiple views with Liquid Glass containers\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GlassEffectContainer] when applying Liquid Glass effects on multiple views to achieve the best rendering performance. A container also allows views with Liquid Glass effects to blend their shapes together and to morph in and out of each other during transitions. Inside a container, each view with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/glassEffect(_:in:)] modifier renders with the effects behind it.\n\nCustomize the spacing on the container to control how the Liquid Glass effects behind views interact with one another. The larger the spacing value on the container, the sooner the Liquid Glass effects behind views blend together and merge the shapes during a transition. A spacing value on the container that’s larger than the spacing of an interior [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack], [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/VStack], or other layout container causes Liquid Glass effects to blend together at rest because the views are too close to each other. Animating views in or out causes the shapes to morph apart or together as the space in the container changes.\n\nThe `glassEffect(_:in:)` modifier captures the content to send to the container to render. Apply the `glassEffect(_:in:)` modifier after other modifiers that affect the appearance of the view.\n\nIn the example below, two images are placed close to each other and the Liquid Glass effects begin to blend their shapes together. This creates a fluid animation as components move around each other within a container:\n\n\n\nIn some cases, you want the geometries of multiple views to contribute to a single Liquid Glass effect capsule, even when your content is at rest. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/glassEffectUnion(id:namespace:)] modifier to specify that a view contributes to a unified effect with a particular ID. This combines all effects with a similar shape, Liquid Glass effect, and ID into a single shape with the applied Liquid Glass material. This is especially useful when creating views dynamically, or with views that live outside of a layout container, like an `HStack` or `VStack`.\n\n\n\n## Morph Liquid Glass effects during transitions\n\nMorphing effects occur during transitions or animations between views with Liquid Glass effects. Coordinate transitions between views with effects in a container by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/glassEffectID(_:in:)] modifier. [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GlassEffectTransition] allows you to specify the type of transition to use when you want to add or remove effects within a container. For effects you want to add or remove that are positioned within the container’s assigned spacing, the default transition type is [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GlassEffectTransition\/matchedGeometry].\n\nIf you prefer to have a simpler transition or to create a custom transition, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GlassEffectTransition\/materialize] transition and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/withAnimation(_:_:)]. Use the `materialize` transition for effects you want to add or remove that are farther from each other than the container’s assigned spacing. To provide people with a consistent experience, use `matchedGeometry` and `materialize` transitions across your apps. The system applies more than opacity changes with the available transition types.\n\nAssociate each Liquid Glass effect with a unique identifier within a namespace that the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Namespace] property wrapper provides. These IDs ensure SwiftUI animates the same shapes correctly when a shape appears or disappears due to view hierarchy changes. SwiftUI uses the spacing provided to the effect container along with the geometry of the shapes themselves to determine when and which appropriate shapes to morph into and out of.\n\nThe `glassEffectID(_:in:)` and `glassEffectTransition(_:)` modifiers only affect their content during view hierarchy transitions or animations.\n\nIn the example below, the eraser image transitions into and out of the pencil image when the `isExpanded` variable changes. The `GlassEffectContainer` has a spacing value of `40.0`, and the `HStack` within it has a spacing of `40.0`. This morphs the eraser image into the pencil image when the eraser’s nearest edge is less than or equal to the container’s spacing.\n\n## Optimize performance when using Liquid Glass effects\n\nCreating too many Liquid Glass effect containers and applying too many effects to views outside of containers can degrade performance. Limit the use of Liquid Glass effects onscreen at the same time. Additionally, optimize how your app spends rendering time as people use it. To learn how to improve the performance of your UI, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/tech-talks\/10855\/] and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/306\/].",

This applies the same responsive and fluid reactions that [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PrimitiveButtonStyle\/glass] provides to standard buttons.\n\nIn the examples below, observe how to apply Liquid Glass effects to a view, use an alternate shape with a specific corner radius, and create a tinted view that responds to interactivity:\n\n\n\n```swift\nText(\"Hello, World!\")\n    .font(.title)\n    .padding()\n    .glassEffect()\n\nText(\"Hello, World!\")\n    .font(.title)\n    .padding()\n    .glassEffect(in: .rect(cornerRadius: 16.0))\n\nText(\"Hello, World!\")\n    .font(.title)\n    .padding()\n    .glassEffect(.regular.tint(.orange).interactive())\n```\n\n## Combine multiple views with Liquid Glass containers\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GlassEffectContainer] when applying Liquid Glass effects on multiple views to achieve the best rendering performance. A container also allows views with Liquid Glass effects to blend their shapes together and to morph in and out of each other during transitions.

A spacing value on the container that’s larger than the spacing of an interior [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack], [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/VStack], or other layout container causes Liquid Glass effects to blend together at rest because the views are too close to each other.

This creates a fluid animation as components move around each other within a container:\n\n\n\n```swift\nGlassEffectContainer(spacing: 40.0) {\n    HStack(spacing: 40.0) {\n        Image(systemName: \"scribble.variable\")\n            .frame(width: 80.0, height: 80.0)\n            .font(.system(size: 36))\n            .glassEffect()\n\n        Image(systemName: \"eraser.fill\")\n            .frame(width: 80.0, height: 80.0)\n            .font(.system(size: 36))\n            .glassEffect()\n\n            \/\/ An `offset` shows how Liquid Glass effects react to each other in a container.\n            \/\/ Use animations and components appearing and disappearing to obtain effects that look purposeful.\n            .offset(x: -40.0, y: 0.0)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn some cases, you want the geometries of multiple views to contribute to a single Liquid Glass effect capsule, even when your content is at rest. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/glassEffectUnion(id:namespace:)] modifier to specify that a view contributes to a unified effect with a particular ID. This combines all effects with a similar shape, Liquid Glass effect, and ID into a single shape with the applied Liquid Glass material. This is especially useful when creating views dynamically, or with views that live outside of a layout container, like an `HStack` or `VStack`.\n\n\n\n```swift\nlet symbolSet: [String] = [\"cloud.bolt.rain.fill\", \"sun.rain.fill\", \"moon.stars.fill\", \"moon.fill\"]\n\nGlassEffectContainer(spacing: 20.0) {\n    HStack(spacing: 20.0) {\n        ForEach(symbolSet.indices, id: \\.self) { item in\n            Image(systemName: symbolSet[item])\n                .frame(width: 80.0, height: 80.0)\n                .font(.system(size: 36))\n                .glassEffect()\n                .glassEffectUnion(id: item < 2 ? \"1\" : \"2\", namespace: namespace)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Morph Liquid Glass effects during transitions\n\nMorphing effects occur during transitions or animations between views with Liquid Glass effects.
