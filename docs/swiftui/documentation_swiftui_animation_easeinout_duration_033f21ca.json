  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nAn ease-in ease-out animation with a specified duration.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAn easing animation provides motion with a natural feel by varying the acceleration and deceleration of the animation, which matches how things tend to move in reality. An ease in and out animation starts slowly, increasing its speed towards the halfway point, and finally decreasing the speed towards the end of the animation.\n\nUse `easeInOut(duration:)` when you want to specify the time it takes for the animation to complete. Otherwise, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/easeInOut] to perform the animation for a default length of time.\n\nThe following code shows an example of animating the size changes of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] using an ease in and out animation with a duration of one second.",
