  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nImage sizes vary widely, from single-pixel PNG files to digital photography images with millions of pixels. Because device sizes also vary, apps commonly need to make runtime adjustments to image sizes so they fit within the visible user interface. SwiftUI provides modifiers to scale, clip, and transform images to fit your interface perfectly.\n\n### Scale a large image to fit its container using resizing\n\nConsider the image `Landscape_4.jpg`, a photograph with the dimensions 4032 x 3024, showing a water wheel, the surrounding building, and the sky above.\n\n\n\nThe following example loads the image directly into an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image] view, and then places it in a 300 x 400 point frame, with a blue border:\n\nAs seen in the following screenshot, the image data loads at full size into the view, so only the clouds from the upper left of the original image are visible. Because the image renders at full size, and the blue frame is smaller than the original image, the image extends beyond the frame’s boundaries.\n\n\n\nTo fix this, you need to apply two modifiers to the `Image`:\n\n\n\n### Keep image data inside the view’s bounds using clipping\n\nIf you use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ContentMode\/fill] when scaling an image, a portion of an image may extend beyond the view’s bounds, unless the view matches the image’s aspect ratio exactly. The following example illustrates this problem:\n\n\n\nTo prevent this problem, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/clipped(antialiased:)] modifier. This modifier simply cuts off excess image rendering at the bounding frame of the view. Optionally, you can add an antialiasing behavior to apply smoothing to the edges of the clipping rectangle; this parameter defaults to `false`. The following example shows the effect of adding clipping to the previous fill-mode example:\n\n\n\n### Use interpolation flags to adjust rendered image quality\n\nRendering an image at anything other than its original size requires *interpolation*: using the existing image data to approximate a representation at a different size. Different approaches to performing interpolation have different trade-offs between computational complexity and visual quality of the rendered image. You can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image\/interpolation(_:)] modifier to provide a hint for SwiftUI rendering behavior.\n\nIt’s easier to see the effect of interpolation when scaling a smaller image into a larger space, because the rendered image requires more image data than is available. Consider the following example, which renders a 34 x 34 image named `dot_green` into the same 300 x 400 container frame as before:\n\nPassing the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image\/Interpolation\/none] value to [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image\/interpolation(_:)] results in a highly pixelated rendered image.\n\n\n\nIf you change the interpolation value to [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image\/Interpolation\/medium], SwiftUI smoothes out the pixel data to produce an image that isn’t as pixelated:\n\n\n\n### Fill a space with a repeating image using tiling\n\nWhen you have an image that’s much smaller than the space you want to render it into, another option  to fill the space is *tiling*: repeating the same image over and over again. To tile an image, pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image\/ResizingMode\/tile] parameter to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image\/resizable(capInsets:resizingMode:)] modifier:\n\n\n\nTiling can be particuarly useful when using an image that, when placed end-to-end with copies of itself, creates a larger pattern with no visual discontinuities.",

Because device sizes also vary, apps commonly need to make runtime adjustments to image sizes so they fit within the visible user interface. SwiftUI provides modifiers to scale, clip, and transform images to fit your interface perfectly.\n\n### Scale a large image to fit its container using resizing\n\nConsider the image `Landscape_4.jpg`, a photograph with the dimensions 4032 x 3024, showing a water wheel, the surrounding building, and the sky above.\n\n\n\nThe following example loads the image directly into an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image] view, and then places it in a 300 x 400 point frame, with a blue border:\n\n```swift\n    Image(\"Landscape_4\")\n        .frame(width: 300, height: 400, alignment: .topLeading)\n        .border(.blue)\n```\n\nAs seen in the following screenshot, the image data loads at full size into the view, so only the clouds from the upper left of the original image are visible. Because the image renders at full size, and the blue frame is smaller than the original image, the image extends beyond the frame’s boundaries.\n\n\n\nTo fix this, you need to apply two modifiers to the `Image`:\n\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image\/resizable(capInsets:resizingMode:)] tells the image view to adjust the image representation to match the size of the view. By default, this modifier scales the image by reducing the size of larger images and enlarges images smaller than the view. By itself, this modifier scales each axis of the image independently.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/aspectRatio(_:contentMode:)] corrects the behavior where the image scaling is different for each axis. This preserves the image’s original aspect ratio, using one of two strategies defined by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ContentMode] enumeration. [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ContentMode\/fit] scales the image to fit the view size along one axis, possibly leaving empty space along the other axis. [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ContentMode\/fill] scales the image to fill the entire view.\n\n```swift\n  Image(\"Landscape_4\")\n      .resizable()\n      .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)\n      .frame(width: 300, height: 400, alignment: .topLeading)\n      .border(.blue)\n```\n\n\n\n### Keep image data inside the view’s bounds using clipping\n\nIf you use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ContentMode\/fill] when scaling an image, a portion of an image may extend beyond the view’s bounds, unless the view matches the image’s aspect ratio exactly.
