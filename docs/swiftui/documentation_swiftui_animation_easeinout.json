An ease in and out animation starts slowly, increasing its speed towards the halfway point, and finally decreasing the speed towards the end of the animation.\n\nThe `easeInOut` animation has a default duration of 0.35 seconds. To specify the duration, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/easeInOut(duration:)] method.\n\nThe following code shows an example of animating the size changes of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] using an ease in and out animation.",
