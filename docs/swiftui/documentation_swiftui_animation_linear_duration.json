This constant speed makes a linear animation ideal for animating the movement of objects where changes in the speed might feel awkward, such as with an activity indicator.\n\nUse `linear(duration:)` when you want to specify the time it takes for the animation to complete. Otherwise, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/linear] to perform the animation for a default length of time.\n\nThe following code shows an example of using linear animation with a duration of two seconds to animate the movement of a circle as it moves between the leading and trailing edges of the view. The color of the circle also animates from red to blue as it moves across the view.",
