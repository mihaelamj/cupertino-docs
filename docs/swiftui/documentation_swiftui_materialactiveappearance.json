For example, materials used as the `window` container background can be made to always appear active by setting the active appearance behavior to be always active:\n\n```swift\nText(\"Hello, World!\")\n    .containerBackground(\n        Material.regular.materialActiveAppearance(.active),\n        for: .window)\n```\n\n## Type Properties\n\n- **active**: Materials will always appear active.\n- **automatic**: Materials will automatically appear active or inactive based on context and platform convention.\n- **inactive**: Materials will always appear inactive.\n- **matchWindow**: Materials will have an active or inactive appearance based on the active appearance of their window.\n\n## Transforming colors\n\n- **brightness(_:)**: Brightens this view by the specified amount.\n- **contrast(_:)**: Sets the contrast and separation between similar colors in this view.\n- **colorInvert()**: Inverts the colors in this view.\n- **colorMultiply(_:)**: Adds a color multiplication effect to this view.\n- **saturation(_:)**: Adjusts the color saturation of this view.\n- **grayscale(_:)**: Adds a grayscale effect to this view.\n- **hueRotation(_:)**: Applies a hue rotation effect to this view.\n- **luminanceToAlpha()**: Adds a luminance to alpha effect to this view.\n- **materialActiveAppearance(_:)**: Sets an explicit active appearance for materials in this view.\n- **materialActiveAppearance**: The behavior materials should use for their active state, defaulting to `automatic`.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- Equatable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
