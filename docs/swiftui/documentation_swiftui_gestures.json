You can listen for taps, drags, pinches, and other standard gestures.\n\n\n\nYou can also compose custom gestures from individual gestures using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Gesture\/simultaneously(with:)], [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Gesture\/sequenced(before:)], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Gesture\/exclusively(before:)] modifiers, or combine gestures with keyboard modifiers using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Gesture\/modifiers(_:)] modifier.\n\n\n\nFor design guidance, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/gestures] in the Human Interface Guidelines.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Adding interactivity with gestures**: Use gesture modifiers to add interactivity to your app.\n\n## Recognizing tap gestures\n\n- **onTapGesture(count:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a tap gesture.\n- **onTapGesture(count:coordinateSpace:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a tap gesture, and provides the action with the location of the interaction.\n- **TapGesture**: A gesture that recognizes one or more taps.\n- **SpatialTapGesture**: A gesture that recognizes one or more taps and reports their location.\n\n## Recognizing long press gestures\n\n- **onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration:maximumDistance:perform:onPressingChanged:)**: Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a long press gesture.\n- **onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration:perform:onPressingChanged:)**: Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a long press gesture.\n- **onLongTouchGesture(minimumDuration:perform:onTouchingChanged:)**: Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a remote long touch gesture. A long touch gesture is when the finger is on the remote touch surface without actually pressing.\n- **LongPressGesture**: A gesture that succeeds when the user performs a long press.\n\n## Recognizing spatial events\n\n- **SpatialEventGesture**: A gesture that provides information about ongoing spatial events like clicks and touches.\n- **SpatialEventCollection**: A collection of spatial input events that target a specific view.\n- **Chirality**: The chirality, or handedness, of a pose.\n\n## Recognizing gestures that change over time\n\n- **gesture(_:)**: Attaches an

view.\n- **SequenceGesture**: A gesture that’s a sequence of two gestures.\n- **SimultaneousGesture**: A gesture containing two gestures that can happen at the same time with neither of them preceding the other.\n- **ExclusiveGesture**: A gesture that consists of two gestures where only one of them can succeed.\n\n## Defining custom gestures\n\n- **highPriorityGesture(_:including:)**: Attaches a gesture to the view with a higher precedence than gestures defined by the view.\n- **highPriorityGesture(_:isEnabled:)**: Attaches a gesture to the view with a higher precedence than gestures defined by the view.\n- **highPriorityGesture(_:name:isEnabled:)**: Attaches a gesture to the view with a higher precedence than gestures defined by the view.\n- **handGestureShortcut(_:isEnabled:)**: Assigns a hand gesture shortcut to the modified control.\n- **defersSystemGestures(on:)**: Sets the screen edge from which you want your gesture to take precedence over the system gesture.\n- **Gesture**: An instance that matches a sequence of events to a gesture, and returns a stream of values for each of its states.\n- **AnyGesture**: A type-erased gesture.\n- **HandActivationBehavior**: An activation behavior specific to hand-driven input.\n- **HandGestureShortcut**: Hand gesture shortcuts describe finger and wrist movements that the user can perform in order to activate a button or toggle.\n\n## Managing gesture state\n\n- **GestureState**: A property wrapper type that updates a property while the user performs a gesture and resets the property back to its initial state when the gesture ends.\n- **GestureStateGesture**: A gesture that updates the state provided by a gesture’s updating callback.\n\n## Handling activation events\n\n- **allowsWindowActivationEvents(_:)**: Configures whether gestures in this view hierarchy can handle events that activate the containing window.\n\n## Deprecated gestures\n\n- **MagnificationGesture**: A gesture that recognizes a magnification motion and tracks the amount of magnification.\n- **RotationGesture**: A gesture that recognizes a rotation motion and tracks the angle of the rotation.\n\n## Event handling\n\n- **Input events**: Respond to input from a hardware device, like a keyboard or a Touch Bar.\n- **Clipboard**: Enable people to move or duplicate items by issuing Copy and Paste commands.\n- **Drag and drop**: Enable people to move or duplicate items by dragging them from one location to another.\n- **Focus**: Identify and control which visible object responds to user interaction.\n- **System events**: React to system events,
