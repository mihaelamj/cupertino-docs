The default is [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Anchor\/Source\/bounds].\n- **arrowEdge**: The edge of the `attachmentAnchor` that defines the location of the popover’s arrow. The default is `nil`, which results in the system allowing any arrow edge.\n- **content**: A closure returning the content of the popover.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to show a popover whose contents are a SwiftUI view that you provide when a bound Boolean variable is `true`. In the example below, a popover displays whenever the user toggles the `isShowingPopover` state variable by pressing the “Show Popover” button:\n\n```swift\nstruct PopoverExample: View {\n    @State private var isShowingPopover = false\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Show Popover\") {\n            self.isShowingPopover = true\n        }\n        .popover(\n            isPresented: $isShowingPopover, arrowEdge: .bottom\n        ) {\n            Text(\"Popover Content\")\n                .padding()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### Breakthrough effect\n\nIn visionOS, most system presentations appear with a breakthrough effect by default. To change how the enclosing presentation breaks through content occluding it, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/presentationBreakthroughEffect(_:)], like in the following example:\n\n```swift\n.popover(isPresented: $isShowingPopover) {\n    Text(\"Popover Content\")\n        .padding()\n        .presentationBreakthroughEffect(.prominent)\n}\n```\n\n## Showing a sheet, cover, or popover\n\n- **sheet(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a sheet when a binding to a Boolean value that you provide is true.\n- **sheet(item:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a sheet using the given item as a data source for the sheet’s content.\n- **fullScreenCover(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a modal view that covers as much of the screen as possible when binding to a Boolean value you provide is true.\n- **fullScreenCover(item:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a modal view that covers as much of the screen as possible using the binding you provide as a data source for the sheet’s content.\n- **popover(item:attachmentAnchor:arrowEdge:content:)**: Presents a popover using the given item as a data source for the popover’s content.\n- **PopoverAttachmentAnchor**: An attachment anchor for a popover.\n\n",
