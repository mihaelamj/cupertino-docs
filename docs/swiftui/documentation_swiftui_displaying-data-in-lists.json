  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nDisplaying a collection of data in a vertical list is a common requirement in many apps. Whether it’s a list of contacts, a schedule of events, an index of categories, or a shopping list, you’ll often find a use for a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List].\n\nList views display collections of items vertically, load rows as needed, and add scrolling when the rows don’t fit on the screen, making them suitable for displaying large collections of data.\n\nBy default, list views also apply platform-appropriate styling to their elements. For example, on iOS, the default configuration of a list displays a separator line between each row, and adds disclosure indicators next to items that initiate navigation actions.\n\nThe code in this article shows the use of list views to display a company’s staff directory. Each section enhances the usefulness of the list, by adding custom cells, splitting the list into sections, and using the list selection to navigate to a detail view.\n\n### Prepare your data for iteration\n\nThe most common use of [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List] is for representing collections of information in your data model. The following example defines a `Person` as an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Identifiable] type with the properties `name` and `phoneNumber`. An array called `staff` contains two instances of this type.\n\nTo present the contents of the array as a list, the example creates a `List` instance. The list’s content builder uses a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ForEach] to iterate over the `staff` array. For each member of the array, the listing creates a row view by instantiating a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] that contains the name of the `Person`.\n\n\n\nMembers of a list must be uniquely identifiable from one another. Unique identifiers allow SwiftUI to automatically generate animations for changes in the underlying data, like inserts, deletions, and moves. Identify list members either by using a type that conforms to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Identifiable], as `Person` does, or by providing an `id` parameter with the key path to a unique property of the type. The `ForEach` that populates the list above depends on this behavior, as do the `List` initializers that take a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/RandomAccessCollection] of members to iterate over.\n\n### Display data inside a row\n\nEach row inside a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List] must be a SwiftUI [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View]. You may be able to represent your data with a single view such as an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] view, or you may need to define a custom view to compose several views into something more complex.\n\nAs your row views get more sophisticated, refactor the views into separate view structures, passing in the data that the row needs to render. The following example defines a `PersonRowView` to create a two-line view for a `Person`, using fonts, colors, and the system “phone” icon image to visually style the data.\n\n\n\nFor more information on composing the types of views commonly used inside list rows, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Building-Layouts-with-Stack-Views].\n\n### Represent data hierarchy with sections\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List] views can also display data with a level of hierarchy, grouping associated data into sections.\n\nConsider an expanded data model that represents an entire company, including multiple departments. Each `Department` has a name and an array of `Person` instances, and the company has an array of the `Department` type.\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Section] views to give the data inside a `List` a level of hierarchy. Start by creating the `List`, using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ForEach] to iterate over the `company.departments` array, and then create `Section` views for each department. Within the section’s view builder, use a `ForEach` to iterate over the department’s `staff`, and return a customized view for each `Person`.\n\n\n\n## Use Lists for Navigation\n\nUsing a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/NavigationLink] within a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List] contained inside a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/NavigationView] adds platform-appropriate visual styling, and in some cases, additional container views that provide the structure for navigation. SwiftUI uses one of two visual presentations, based on the runtime environment:\n\nThe following example sets up a navigation-based UI by wrapping the list with a navigation view. Instances of `NavigationLink` wrap the list’s rows to provide a `destination` view to navigate to when the user taps the row. If a split view navigation is appropriate for the platform, the right panel initially contains the “No Selection” placeholder view, which the navigation view replaces with the destination view when the user makes a selection.\n\nIn this example, the view passed in as the `destination` is a `PersonDetailView`, which repeats the information from the list. In a more complex app, this detail view could show more information about a `Person` than would fit inside the list row.\n\nOn most iOS devices (those with a compact horizontal size class), the list appears as a view by itself, and tapping a row performs an animated transition to the destination view. The following figure shows both the list view and the destination view that appears when the user makes a selection:\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, iPadOS and macOS show the list and the detail view together as a multi-column view. The following figure shows what this example looks like on macOS prior to making a selection, which means the “No selection” placeholder view is still in the detail column.\n\n\n\nYou can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/navigationViewStyle(_:)] view modifier to change the default behavior of a `NavigationView`. For example, on iOS, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/StackNavigationViewStyle] forces single-column mode, even on an iPad in landscape orientation.",

SwiftUI uses one of two visual presentations, based on the runtime environment:\n\n- A list with disclosure indicators, which performs an animated navigation to a destination scene when the user chooses a list item. SwiftUI uses this presentation on watchOS, tvOS, and on most iOS devices except as described below.\n- A two-panel split view, with the top-level data as a list on the left side and the detail on the right. To get this presentation, you also need to provide a placeholder view after the list; this placeholder fills the detail pane until the user makes a selection. SwiftUI uses this two-panel approach on macOS, iPadOS, and on iOS devices with sufficient horizontal space, as indicated by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/horizontalSizeClass] environment value.\n\nThe following example sets up a navigation-based UI by wrapping the list with a navigation view. Instances of `NavigationLink` wrap the list’s rows to provide a `destination` view to navigate to when the user taps the row. If a split view navigation is appropriate for the platform, the right panel initially contains the “No Selection” placeholder view, which the navigation view replaces with the destination view when the user makes a selection.\n\n```swift\nNavigationView {\n    List {\n        ForEach(company.departments) { department in\n            Section(header: Text(department.name)) {\n                ForEach(department.staff) { person in\n                    NavigationLink(destination: PersonDetailView(person: person)) {\n                        PersonRowView(person: person)\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    .navigationTitle(\"Staff Directory\")\n\n    \/\/ Placeholder\n    Text(\"No Selection\")\n        .font(.headline)\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the view passed in as the `destination` is a `PersonDetailView`, which repeats the information from the list. In a more complex app, this detail view could show more information about a `Person` than would fit inside the list row.\n\n```swift\nstruct PersonDetailView: View {\n    var person: Person\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Text(person.name)\n                .foregroundColor(.primary)\n                .font(.title)\n                .padding()\n            HStack {\n                Label(person.phoneNumber, systemImage: \"phone\")\n            }\n            .foregroundColor(.secondary)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOn most iOS devices (those with a compact horizontal size class), the list appears as a view by itself, and tapping a row performs an animated transition to the destination view. The following figure shows both the list view and the destination view that appears when the user makes a selection:\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, iPadOS and macOS show the list and the detail view together as a multi-column view. The following figure shows what this example looks like on macOS prior to making a selection, which means the “No selection” placeholder view is still in the detail column.\n\n\n\nYou can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/navigationViewStyle(_:)] view modifier to change the default behavior of a `NavigationView`. For example, on iOS, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/StackNavigationViewStyle] forces single-column mode, even on an iPad in landscape orientation.\n\n## Creating a list\n\n- **List**: A container that presents rows of data arranged in a single column, optionally providing the ability to select one or more members.\n- **listStyle(_:)**: Sets the style for lists within this view.\n\n",
