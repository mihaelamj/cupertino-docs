  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nUse `Stepper(_:value:in:step:onEditingChanged:)` to create a stepper that increments or decrements a value within a specific range of values by a specific step size. In the example below, a stepper increments or decrements a binding to value over a range of `1...50` by `5` each time the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or decrement buttons:\n\n",

Defaults to `1`.\n- **onEditingChanged**: A closure that’s called when editing begins and ends. For example, on iOS, the user may touch and hold the increment or decrement buttons on a `Stepper` which causes the execution of the `onEditingChanged` closure at the start and end of the gesture.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse `Stepper(_:value:in:step:onEditingChanged:)` to create a stepper that increments or decrements a value within a specific range of values by a specific step size. In the example below, a stepper increments or decrements a binding to value over a range of `1...50` by `5` each time the user clicks or taps the stepper’s increment or decrement buttons:\n\n```swift\nstruct StepperView: View {\n    @State private var value = 0\n    let step = 5\n    let range = 1...50\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Stepper(\"Current: \\(value) in \\(range.description) stepping by \\(step)\",\n                value: $value,\n                in: range,\n                step: step)\n            .padding(10)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Creating a stepper over a range\n\n- **init(value:in:step:label:onEditingChanged:)**: Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value and within a range of values you provide.\n- **init(value:in:step:format:label:onEditingChanged:)**: Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value and within a range of values you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.\n- **init(_:value:in:step:format:onEditingChanged:)**: Creates a stepper instance that increments and decrements a binding to a value, by a step size and within a closed range that you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.\n\n",
