The animator then begins immediately animating to the view produced by sending the second phase to the `content` closure using the animation returned from the `animation` closure. This procedure repeats for successive phases until reaching the last phase, after which the animator loops back to the first phase again.",

Ensure that the sequence isn’t empty. If it is, SwiftUI logs a runtime warning and also returns a visual warning as the output view.\n- **content**: A view builder closure that takes the current phase as an input. Return a view that’s based on the current phase.\n- **animation**: A closure that takes the current phase as input. Return the animation to use when transitioning to the next phase. If you return `nil`, the transition doesn’t animate. If you don’t set this parameter, SwiftUI uses a default animation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen the phase animator first appears, this initializer renders the `content` closure using the first phase as input to the closure. The animator then begins immediately animating to the view produced by sending the second phase to the `content` closure using the animation returned from the `animation` closure. This procedure repeats for successive phases until reaching the last phase, after which the animator loops back to the first phase again.\n\n## Creating a phase animator\n\n- **init(_:trigger:content:animation:)**: Cycles through a sequence of phases in response to changes in a specified value, animating updates to a view on each phase change.\n\n",
