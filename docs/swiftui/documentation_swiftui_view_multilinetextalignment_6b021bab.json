For example, the modifier centers the contents of the following [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] view:\n\n```swift\nText(\"This is a block of text that shows up in a text element as multiple lines.\\(\"\\n\") Here we have chosen to center this text.\")\n    .frame(width: 200)\n    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)\n```\n\nThe text in the above example spans more than one line because:\n\n- The newline character introduces a line break.\n- The frame modifier limits the space available to the text view, and by default a text view wraps lines that don’t fit in the available width. As a result, the text before the explicit line break wraps to three lines, and the text after uses two lines.\n\nThe modifier applies the alignment to the all the lines of text in the view, regardless of why wrapping occurs:\n\n\n\nThe modifier has no effect on a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] view that contains only one line of text, because a text view has a width that exactly matches the width of its widest line.
