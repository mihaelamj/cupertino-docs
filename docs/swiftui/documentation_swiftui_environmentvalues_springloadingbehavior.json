  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nSpring loading refers to a view being activated during a drag and drop interaction. On iOS this can occur when pausing briefly on top of a view with dragged content. On macOS this can occur with similar brief pauses or on pressure-sensitive systems by “force clicking” during the drag. This has no effect on tvOS or watchOS.\n\nThis is commonly used with views that have a navigation or presentation effect, allowing the destination to be revealed without pausing the drag interaction. For example, a button that reveals a list of folders that a dragged item can be dropped onto.\n\nA value of `enabled` means that a view should support spring loaded interactions if it is able, and `disabled` means it should not. A value of `automatic` means that a view should follow its default behavior, such as a `TabView` automatically allowing spring loading, but a `Picker` with `segmented` style would not.",
