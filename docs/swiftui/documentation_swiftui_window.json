  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse a `Window` scene to augment the main interface of your app with a window that gives people access to supplemental functionality. For example, you can create a secondary window in a mail reader app that enables people to view the status of their account connections:\n\nProvide a title as the first argument to the window’s intializer. The system uses the title to identify the window to people using your app in the window’s title bar or in the list of available singleton windows that the Windows menu displays automatically.\n\n### Open a window programmatically\n\nPeople open the window by selecting it in the Windows menu, but you can also open the window programmatically using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/openWindow] action that you read from the environment. Use the `id` parameter that you initialize the window with to indicate which window to open. For example, you can create a button to open the window from the previous example:\n\nIf the window is already open when you call this action, the action brings the open window to the front. Be sure to use unique identifiers across all of the `Window` and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WindowGroup] instances that you define.\n\n### Dismiss a window programmatically\n\nThe system provides people with controls to close windows, but you can also close a window programmatically using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/dismiss] action from within the window’s view hierarchy. For example, you can include a button in the connection doctor view that dismisses the view:\n\nThe dismiss action doesn’t close the window if you call it from a modal — like a sheet or a popover — that you present from within the window. In that case, the action dismisses the modal presentation instead.\n\n### Use a window as the main scene\n\nYou can use a window as the main scene of your app when multi-window functionality isn’t appropriate. For example, it might not make sense to display more than one window for a video call app that relies on a hardware resource, like a camera:\n\nIf your app uses a single window as its primary scene, the app quits when the window closes. This behavior differs from an app that uses a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WindowGroup] as its primary scene, where the app continues to run even after closing all of its windows.",
