If you mark the background as nonremovable, the widget becomes ineligible in various contexts that require a removable background. For example, a small widget without a removable background doesn’t appear in the widget gallery on the iPad Lock Screen.\n\nIf you mark a background as nonremovable, the system always displays the background container of the widget. Note that the background may render differently; for example, it can appear faded or desaturated.\n\nThis modifier has no effect on operation system versions prior to iOS 17, watchOS 10, or macOS 14.",
