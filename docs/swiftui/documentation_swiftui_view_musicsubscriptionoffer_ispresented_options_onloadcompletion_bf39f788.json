The subscription offer UI becomes visible when it calls this function with the error argument as `nil`. If there is an error in the loading process, the subscription offer calls this function with a non-`nil` error, and it resets the `isPresented` binding to `false`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe example below displays a simple button that the user can activate to begin presenting subscription offers for Apple Music.
