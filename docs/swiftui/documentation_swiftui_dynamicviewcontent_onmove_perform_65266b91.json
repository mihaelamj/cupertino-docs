The closure takes two arguments that represent the offset relative to the dynamic view’s underlying collection of data. Pass `nil` to disable the ability to move items.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that calls `action` when elements are moved within the original view.\n\n## Responding to updates\n\n- **onDelete(perform:)**: Sets the deletion action for the dynamic view. You must delete the corresponding item within `action`, as it will be called after the row has already been removed from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List].\n- **onInsert(of:perform:)**: Sets the insert action for the dynamic view.\n- **dropDestination(for:action:)**: Sets the insert action for the dynamic view.\n\n",
