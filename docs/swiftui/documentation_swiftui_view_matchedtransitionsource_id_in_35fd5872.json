New namespaces are created by adding an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Namespace] variable to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View] type and reading its value in the view’s body method.\n\n## Defining transitions\n\n- **transition(_:)**: Associates a transition with the view.\n- **Transition**: A description of view changes to apply when a view is added to and removed from the view hierarchy.\n- **TransitionProperties**: The properties a `Transition` can have.\n- **TransitionPhase**: An indication of which the current stage of a transition.\n- **AsymmetricTransition**: A composite `Transition` that uses a different transition for insertion versus removal.\n- **AnyTransition**: A type-erased transition.\n- **contentTransition(_:)**: Modifies the view to use a given transition as its method of animating changes to the contents of its views.\n- **contentTransition**: The current method of animating the contents of views.\n- **contentTransitionAddsDrawingGroup**: A Boolean value that controls whether views that render content transitions use GPU-accelerated rendering.\n- **ContentTransition**: A kind of transition that applies to the content within a single view, rather than to the insertion or removal of a view.\n- **PlaceholderContentView**: A placeholder used to construct an inline modifier, transition, or other helper type.\n- **navigationTransition(_:)**: Sets the navigation transition style for this view.\n- **NavigationTransition**: A type that defines the transition to use when navigating to a view.\n- **matchedTransitionSource(id:in:configuration:)**: Identifies this view as the source of a navigation transition, such as a zoom transition.\n- **MatchedTransitionSourceConfiguration**: A configuration that defines the appearance of a matched transition source.\n\n",
