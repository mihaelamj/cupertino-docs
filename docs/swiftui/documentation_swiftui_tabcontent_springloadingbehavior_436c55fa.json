This has no effect on tvOS or watchOS.\n\nThis is commonly used with views that have a navigation or presentation effect, allowing the destination to be revealed without pausing the drag interaction. For example, a button that reveals a list of folders that a dragged item can be dropped onto.\n\nUnlike `disabled(_:)`, this modifier overrides the value set by an ancestor view rather than being unioned with it.
