  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse a `WindowGroup` as a container for a view hierarchy that your app presents. The hierarchy that you declare as the group’s content serves as a template for each window that the app creates from that group:\n\nSwiftUI takes care of certain platform-specific behaviors. For example, on platforms that support it, like macOS and iPadOS, people can open more than one window from the group simultaneously. In macOS, people can gather open windows together in a tabbed interface. Also in macOS, window groups automatically provide commands for standard window management.\n\nEvery window in the group maintains independent state. For example, the system allocates new storage for any [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/State] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/StateObject] variables instantiated by the scene’s view hierarchy for each window that it creates.\n\nFor document-based apps, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DocumentGroup] to define windows instead.\n\n### Open windows programmatically\n\nIf you initialize a window group with an identifier, a presentation type, or both, you can programmatically open a window from the group. For example, you can give the mail viewer scene from the previous example an identifier:\n\nElsewhere in your code, you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/openWindow] action from the environment to create a new window from the group:\n\nBe sure to use unique strings for identifiers that you apply to window groups in your app.\n\n### Present data in a window\n\nIf you initialize a window group with a presentation type, you can pass data of that type to the window when you open it. For example, you can define a second window group for the Mail app that displays a specified message:\n\nWhen you call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/openWindow] action with a value, SwiftUI finds the window group with the matching type and passes a binding to the value into the window group’s content closure. For example, you can define a button that opens a message by passing the message’s identifier:\n\nBe sure that the type you present conforms to both the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Codable] protocols. Also, prefer lightweight data for the presentation value. For model values that conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Identifiable] protocol, the value’s identifier works well as a presentation type, as the above example demonstrates.\n\nIf a window with a binding to the same value that you pass to the `openWindow` action already appears in the user interface, the system brings the existing window to the front rather than opening a new window. If SwiftUI doesn’t have a value to provide — for example, when someone opens a window by choosing File > New Window from the macOS menu bar — SwiftUI passes a binding to a `nil` value instead. To avoid receiving a `nil` value, you can optionally specify a default value in your window group initializer. For example, for the message viewer, you can present a new empty message:\n\nSwiftUI persists the value of the binding for the purposes of state restoration, and reapplies the same value when restoring the window. If the restoration process results in an error, SwiftUI sets the binding to the default value if you provide one, or `nil` otherwise.\n\n### Title your app’s windows\n\nTo help people distinguish among windows from different groups, include a title as the first parameter in the group’s initializer:\n\nSwiftUI uses this title when referring to the window in:\n\nIf you don’t provide a title for a window, the system refers to the window using the app’s name instead.\n\n### Distinguish windows that present like data\n\nTo programmatically distinguish between windows that present the same type of data, like when you use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UUID] as the identifier for more than one model type, add the `id` parameter to the group’s initializer to provide a unique string identifier:\n\nThen use both the identifer and a value to open the window:\n\n### Dismiss a window programmatically\n\nThe system provides people with platform-appropriate controls to dismiss a window. You can also dismiss windows programmatically by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/dismiss] action from within the window’s view hierarchy. For example, you can include a button in the account detail view from the previous example that dismisses the view:\n\nThe dismiss action doesn’t close the window if you call it from a modal — like a sheet or a popover — that you present from the window. In that case, the action dismisses the modal presentation instead.",

The hierarchy that you declare as the group’s content serves as a template for each window that the app creates from that group:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct Mail: App {\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            MailViewer() \/\/ Define a view hierarchy for the window.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSwiftUI takes care of certain platform-specific behaviors. For example, on platforms that support it, like macOS and iPadOS, people can open more than one window from the group simultaneously. In macOS, people can gather open windows together in a tabbed interface. Also in macOS, window groups automatically provide commands for standard window management.\n\n\n\nEvery window in the group maintains independent state. For example, the system allocates new storage for any [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/State] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/StateObject] variables instantiated by the scene’s view hierarchy for each window that it creates.\n\nFor document-based apps, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DocumentGroup] to define windows instead.\n\n### Open windows programmatically\n\nIf you initialize a window group with an identifier, a presentation type, or both, you can programmatically open a window from the group. For example, you can give the mail viewer scene from the previous example an identifier:\n\n```swift\nWindowGroup(id: \"mail-viewer\") { \/\/ Identify the window group.\n    MailViewer()\n}\n```\n\nElsewhere in your code, you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/openWindow] action from the environment to create a new window from the group:\n\n```swift\nstruct NewViewerButton: View {\n    @Environment(\\.openWindow) private var openWindow\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Open new mail viewer\") {\n            openWindow(id: \"mail-viewer\") \/\/ Match the group's identifier.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBe sure to use unique strings for identifiers that you apply to window groups in your app.\n\n### Present data in a window\n\nIf you initialize a window group with a presentation type, you can pass data of that type to the window when you open it. For example, you can define a second window group for the Mail app that displays a specified message:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct Mail: App {\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            MailViewer(id: \"mail-viewer\")\n        }\n\n        \/\/ A window group that displays messages.\n        WindowGroup(for: Message.ID.self) { $messageID in\n            MessageDetail(messageID: messageID)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/openWindow] action with a value, SwiftUI finds the window group with the matching type and passes a binding to the value into the window group’s content closure. For example, you can define a button that opens a message by passing the message’s identifier:\n\n```swift\nstruct NewMessageButton: View {\n    var message: Message\n    @Environment(\\.openWindow) private var openWindow\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Open message\") {\n            openWindow(value: message.id)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBe sure that the type you present conforms to both the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Codable] protocols. Also, prefer lightweight data for the presentation value. For model values that conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Identifiable] protocol, the value’s identifier works well as a presentation type, as the above example demonstrates.\n\nIf a window with a binding to the same value that you pass to the `openWindow` action already appears in the user interface, the system brings the existing window to the front rather than opening a new window. If SwiftUI doesn’t have a value to provide — for example, when someone opens a window by choosing File > New Window from the macOS menu bar — SwiftUI passes a binding to a `nil` value instead. To avoid receiving a `nil` value, you can optionally specify a default value in your window group initializer. For example, for the message viewer, you can present a new empty message:\n\n```swift\nWindowGroup(for: Message.ID.self) { $messageID in\n    MessageDetail(messageID: messageID)\n} defaultValue: {\n    model.makeNewMessage().id \/\/ A new message that your model stores.\n}\n```\n\nSwiftUI persists the value of the binding for the purposes of state restoration, and reapplies the same value when restoring the window. If the restoration process results in an error, SwiftUI sets the binding to the default value if you provide one, or `nil` otherwise.\n\n### Title your app’s windows\n\nTo help people distinguish among windows from different groups, include a title as the first parameter in the group’s initializer:\n\n```swift\nWindowGroup(\"Message\", for: Message.ID.self) { $messageID in\n    MessageDetail(messageID: messageID)\n}\n```\n\nSwiftUI uses this title when referring to the window in:\n\n- The list of new windows that someone can open using the File > New menu.\n- The window’s title bar.\n- The list of open windows that the Window menu displays.\n\nIf you don’t provide a title for a window, the system refers to the window using the app’s name instead.\n\n\n\n### Distinguish windows that present like data\n\nTo programmatically distinguish between windows that present the same type of data, like when you use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UUID] as the identifier for more than one model type, add the `id` parameter to the group’s initializer to provide a unique string identifier:\n\n```swift\nWindowGroup(\"Message\", id: \"message\", for: UUID.self) { $uuid in\n    MessageDetail(uuid: uuid)\n}\nWindowGroup(\"Account\", id: \"account-info\", for: UUID.self) { $uuid in\n    AccountDetail(uuid: uuid)\n}\n```\n\nThen use both the identifer and a value to open the window:\n\n```swift\nstruct ActionButtons: View {\n    var messageID: UUID\n    var accountID: UUID\n\n    @Environment(\\.openWindow) private var openWindow\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack {\n            Button(\"Open message\") {\n                openWindow(id: \"message\", value: messageID)\n            }\n            Button(\"Edit account information\") {\n                openWindow(id: \"account-info\", value: accountID)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Dismiss a window programmatically\n\nThe system provides people with platform-appropriate controls to dismiss a window. You can also dismiss windows programmatically by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/dismiss] action from within the window’s view hierarchy. For example, you can include a button in the account detail view from the previous example that dismisses the view:\n\n```swift\nstruct AccountDetail: View {\n    var uuid: UUID?\n    @Environment(\\.dismiss) private var dismiss\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            \/\/ ...\n\n            Button(\"Dismiss\") {\n                dismiss()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe dismiss action doesn’t close the window if you call it from a modal — like a sheet or a popover — that you present from the window. In that case, the action dismisses the modal presentation instead.\n\n## Creating a window group\n\n- **init(content:)**: Creates a window group.\n- **init(_:content:)**: Creates a window group with a text view title.\n\n## Identifying a window group\n\n- **init(id:content:)**: Creates a window group with an identifier.\n- **init(_:id:content:)**: Creates a window group with a text view title and an identifier.\n\n## Creating a data-driven window group\n\n- **init(for:content:)**: Creates a data-presenting window group.\n- **init(_:for:content:)**: Creates a data-presenting window group with a text view title.\n\n## Providing default data to a window group\n\n- **init(for:content:defaultValue:)**: Creates a data-presenting window group with a default value.\n- **init(_:for:content:defaultValue:)**: Creates a data-presenting window group with a text view title and a default value.\n\n## Identifying a data-driven window group\n\n- **init(id:for:content:)**: Creates a data-presenting window group with an identifier.\n- **init(_:id:for:content:)**: Creates a data-presenting window group with a text view title and an identifier.\n\n## Identifying a window group that has default data\n\n- **init(id:for:content:defaultValue:)**: Creates a data-presenting window group with an identifier and a default value.\n- **init(_:id:for:content:defaultValue:)**: Creates a data-presenting window group with a text view title, an identifier, and a default value.\n\n## Supporting types\n\n- **PresentedWindowContent**: A view that represents the content of a presented window.\n\n## Initializers\n\n- **init(_:id:makeContent:)**: Creates a window group with a text view title and an identifier.\n- **init(_:makeContent:)**: Creates a window group with a text view title.\n- **init(id:makeContent:)**: Creates a window group with an identifier.\n- **init(makeContent:)**: Creates a window group.\n\n## Creating windows\n\n- **Window**: A scene that presents its content in a single, unique window.\n- **UtilityWindow**: A specialized window scene that provides secondary utility to the content of the main scenes of an application.\n- **WindowStyle**: A specification for the appearance and interaction of a window.\n- **windowStyle(_:)**: Sets the style for windows created by this scene.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- Scene\n\n",
