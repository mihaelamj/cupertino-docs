The default value is `automatic`, which means the preference will be given priority when focus is being initialized or relocated programmatically, but not when responding to user-directed navigation commands.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe modified view.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBy default, SwiftUI evaluates default focus when the window first appears, and when a focus state binding update moves focus automatically, but not when responding to user-driven navigation commands.\n\nClients can override the default behavior by specifying an evaluation priority of [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DefaultFocusEvaluationPriority\/userInitiated], which causes SwiftUI to use the client’s preferred default focus in response to user-driven focus navigation as well as automatic changes.\n\nIn the following example, focus automatically goes to the second of the two text fields when the view is first presented in the window.\n\n```swift\nWindowGroup {\n    VStack {\n        TextField(...)\n            .focused($focusedField, equals: .firstField)\n        TextField(...)\n            .focused($focusedField, equals: .secondField)\n    }\n    .defaultFocus($focusedField, .secondField)\n}\n```\n\n## Controlling default focus\n\n- **prefersDefaultFocus(_:in:)**: Indicates that the view should receive focus by default for a given namespace.\n- **DefaultFocusEvaluationPriority**: Prioritizations for default focus preferences when evaluating where to move focus in different circumstances.\n\n",
