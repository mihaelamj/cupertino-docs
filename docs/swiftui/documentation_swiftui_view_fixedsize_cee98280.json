If the child view doesn’t need a fixed size it can accept and conform to the size offered by the parent.\n\nFor example, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] view placed in an explicitly sized frame wraps and truncates its string to remain within its parent’s bounds:\n\n\n\nThe `fixedSize()` modifier can be used to create a view that maintains the *ideal size* of its children both dimensions:\n\nThis can result in the view exceeding the parent’s bounds, which may or may not be the effect you want.\n\n\n\nYou can think of `fixedSize()` as the creation of a *counter proposal* to the view size proposed to a view by its parent.
