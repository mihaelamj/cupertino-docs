The closure takes two arguments: The first argument is the offset relative to the dynamic view’s underlying collection of data. The second argument is an array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSItemProvider] items that represents the data that you want to insert.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that calls `action` when elements are inserted into the original view.\n\n## Responding to updates\n\n- **onDelete(perform:)**: Sets the deletion action for the dynamic view. You must delete the corresponding item within `action`, as it will be called after the row has already been removed from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List].\n- **onMove(perform:)**: Sets the move action for the dynamic view.\n- **dropDestination(for:action:)**: Sets the insert action for the dynamic view.\n\n",
