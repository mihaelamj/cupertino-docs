  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse a `DocumentGroup` scene to tell SwiftUI what kinds of documents your app can open when you declare your app using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/App] protocol.\n\nInitialize a document group scene by passing in the document model and a view capable of displaying the document type. The document types you supply to `DocumentGroup` must conform to [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/FileDocument] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ReferenceFileDocument]. SwiftUI uses the model to add document support to your app. In macOS this includes document-based menu support, including the ability to open multiple documents. On iOS this includes a document browser that can navigate to the documents stored on the file system and multiwindow support:\n\nAny time the configuration changes, SwiftUI updates the contents with that new configuration, similar to other parameterized builders.\n\n### Viewing documents\n\nIf your app only needs to display but not modify a specific document type, you can use the file viewer document group scene. You supply the file type of the document, and a view that displays the document type that you provide:\n\n### Supporting multiple document types\n\nYour app can support multiple document types by adding additional document group scenes:\n\n### Accessing the document’s URL\n\nIf your app needs to know the document’s URL, you can read it from the `editor` closure’s `configuration` parameter, along with the binding to the document. When you create a new document, the configuration’s `fileURL` property is `nil`. Every time it changes, it is passed over to the `DocumentGroup` builder in the updated `configuration`. This ensures that the view you define in the closure always knows the URL of the document it hosts.\n\nThe URL can be used, for example, to present the file path of the file name in the user interface. Don’t access the document’s contents or metadata using the URL because that can conflict with the management of the file that SwiftUI performs. Instead, use the methods that [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/FileDocument] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ReferenceFileDocument] provide to perform read and write operations.",
