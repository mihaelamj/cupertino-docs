The method returns a sequence of per-minute dates in increasing order, from earliest to latest, that represents when the timeline view updates.\n\nFor a `startDate` that’s exactly minute-aligned, the schedule’s sequence of dates starts at that time. Otherwise, it starts at the beginning of the specified minute. For example, for start dates of both `10:09:32` and `10:09:00`, the first entry in the sequence is `10:09:00`.",
