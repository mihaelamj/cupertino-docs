You can use this modifier to observe the focus state of a single view, or programmatically set and remove focus from the view.\n\nIn the following example, a single [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TextField] accepts a user’s desired `username`. The text field binds its focus state to the Boolean value `usernameFieldIsFocused`. A “Submit” button’s action verifies whether the name is available. If the name is unavailable, the button sets `usernameFieldIsFocused` to `true`, which causes focus to return to the text field, so the user can enter a different name.\n\nTo control focus by matching a value, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:equals:)] method instead.",

When focus moves to the view, the binding sets the bound value to `true`. If a caller sets the value to  `true` programmatically, then focus moves to the modified view. When focus leaves the modified view, the binding sets the value to `false`. If a caller sets the value to `false`, SwiftUI automatically dismisses focus.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe modified view.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this modifier to cause the view to receive focus whenever the `condition` value is `true`.
