Then call the instance to push a window. You call the instance directly because it defines a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PushWindowAction\/callAsFunction(id:)] method that Swift calls when you call the instance.\n\nFor example, you can define a button that pushes a video preview from an editor window:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct VideoEditor: App {\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup(id: \"editor\") {\n            EditorView()\n        }\n\n        WindowGroup(id: \"viewer\") {\n            VideoView()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct EditorView: View {\n    @Environment(\\.pushWindow) private var pushWindow\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Play\", systemImage: \"play.fill\") {\n            pushWindow(id: \"viewer\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou indicate which scene to push by providing one of the following:\n\n- A string identifier that you pass through the `id` parameter, as in the above example.\n- A `value` parameter that has a type that matches the type that you specify in the scene’s initializer.\n- Both an identifier and a value. This enables you to define multiple window groups that take input values of the same type like a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UUID].\n\nUse the first option to target either a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WindowGroup] or a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Window] scene in your app that has a matching identifier.

If the interface already has a window from the group that is presenting the specified value, the system brings the window to the front.
