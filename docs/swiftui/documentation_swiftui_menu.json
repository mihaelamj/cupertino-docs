The same approach applies to other controls such as `Toggle`:\n\n### Primary action\n\nMenus can be created with a custom primary action. The primary action will be performed when the user taps or clicks on the body of the control, and the menu presentation will happen on a secondary gesture, such as on long press or on click of the menu indicator. The following example creates a menu that adds bookmarks, with advanced options that are presented in a menu.\n\n### Styling menus\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/menuStyle(_:)] modifier to change the style of all menus in a view.
