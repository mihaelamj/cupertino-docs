The provided [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ContentTransition] can present an opacity animation for content changes, an interpolated animation of the content’s paths as they change, or perform no animation at all.\n\nIn the following example, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Button] changes the color and font size of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] view. Since both of these properties apply to the paths of the text, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ContentTransition\/interpolate] transition can animate a gradual change to these properties through the entire transition. By contrast, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ContentTransition\/opacity] transition would simply fade between the start and end states.\n\nThis example uses an ease-in–ease-out animation with a five-second duration to make it easier to see the effect of the interpolation. The figure below shows the `Text` at the beginning of the animation, halfway through, and at the end.\n\nTo control whether content transitions use GPU-accelerated rendering, set the value of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/contentTransitionAddsDrawingGroup] environment variable.",
