Then call the instance to perform the dismissal. You call the instance directly because it defines a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DismissAction\/callAsFunction()] method that Swift calls when you call the instance.\n\nYou can use this action to:\n\n- Dismiss a modal presentation, like a sheet or a popover.\n- Pop the current view from a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/NavigationStack].\n\nOn apps targeting iOS 18 and aligned releases, you also use the dismiss action to pop the implicit stack of a collapsed [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/NavigationSplitView], or clear the equivalent state in an expanded split view.\n\nThe specific behavior of the action depends on where you call it from. For example, you can create a button that calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DismissAction] inside a view that acts as a sheet:\n\n```swift\nprivate struct SheetContents: View {\n    @Environment(\\.dismiss) private var dismiss\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Done\") {\n            dismiss()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you present the `SheetContents` view, someone can dismiss the sheet by tapping or clicking the sheet’s button:\n\n```swift\nprivate struct DetailView: View {\n    @State private var isSheetPresented = false\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Show Sheet\") {\n            isSheetPresented = true\n        }\n        .sheet(isPresented: $isSheetPresented) {\n            SheetContents()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBe sure that you define the action in the appropriate environment.
