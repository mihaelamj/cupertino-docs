The timing and behavior that determines when a view is visible within the container is controlled by the configuration that is provided to the `scrollTransition` modifier.\n\nIn the `identity` phase, scroll transitions should generally not make any visual change to the view they are applied to, since the transition’s view modifications in the `identity` phase will be applied to the view as long as it is visible. In the `topLeading` and `bottomTrailing` phases, transitions should apply a change that will be animated to create the transition.",

The timing and behavior that determines when a view is visible within the container is controlled by the configuration that is provided to the `scrollTransition` modifier.\n\nIn the `identity` phase, scroll transitions should generally not make any visual change to the view they are applied to, since the transition’s view modifications in the `identity` phase will be applied to the view as long as it is visible. In the `topLeading` and `bottomTrailing` phases, transitions should apply a change that will be animated to create the transition.\n\n## Getting the phase\n\n- **ScrollTransitionPhase.identity**: The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is in the visible area.\n- **ScrollTransitionPhase.topLeading**: The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is about to move into the visible area at the top edge of a vertical scroll view, or the leading edge of a horizont scroll view.\n- **ScrollTransitionPhase.bottomTrailing**: The scroll transition is being applied to a view that is about to move into the visible area at the bottom edge of a vertical scroll view, or the trailing edge of a horizontal scroll view.\n\n## Accessing the phase state\n\n- **isIdentity**\n- **value**: A phase-derived value that can be used to scale or otherwise modify effects.\n\n## Animating scroll transitions\n\n- **scrollTransition(_:axis:transition:)**: Applies the given transition, animating between the phases of the transition as this view appears and disappears within the visible region of the containing scroll view.\n- **scrollTransition(topLeading:bottomTrailing:axis:transition:)**: Applies the given transition, animating between the phases of the transition as this view appears and disappears within the visible region of the containing scroll view.\n- **ScrollTransitionConfiguration**: The configuration of a scroll transition that controls how a transition is applied as a view is scrolled through the visible region of a containing scroll view or other container.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- BitwiseCopyable\n- Copyable\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n\n",
