This is approximately equal to the settling duration, but for very bouncy springs, will be the duration of the period of oscillation for the spring.\n- **extraBounce**: How much additional bounce should be added to the base bounce of 0.3.\n\n## Getting built-in spring animations\n\n- **bouncy**: A spring animation with a predefined duration and higher amount of bounce.\n- **smooth**: A smooth spring animation with a predefined duration and no bounce.\n- **smooth(duration:extraBounce:)**: A smooth spring animation with a predefined duration and no bounce that can be tuned.\n- **snappy**: A spring animation with a predefined duration and small amount of bounce that feels more snappy.\n- **snappy(duration:extraBounce:)**: A spring animation with a predefined duration and small amount of bounce that feels more snappy and can be tuned.\n\n",
