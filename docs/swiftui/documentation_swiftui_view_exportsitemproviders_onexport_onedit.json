An empty array means the view does not currently support exporting.\n- **onExport**: A closure that will be called on request of the items by the shortcut or service.\n- **onEdit**: A closure that will be called after the shortcut or service completes with its output data. This should replace the selected subpart that was exported with `onExport`. Return `false` to indicate that there was a failure to receive the items.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the associated view supports selection, the exported item should reflect that selected subpart.\n\n## Importing and exporting using item providers\n\n- **importsItemProviders(_:onImport:)**: Enables importing item providers from services, such as Continuity Camera on macOS.\n- **exportsItemProviders(_:onExport:)**: Exports a read-only item provider for consumption by shortcuts, quick actions, and services.\n\n",
