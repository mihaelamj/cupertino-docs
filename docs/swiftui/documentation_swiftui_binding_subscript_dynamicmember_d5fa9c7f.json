The returned value is read from, and written to, the original binding. This can be useful when a view accepts a binding for a type that only matches a property of a value from an existing binding.\n\nFor example, the `PlayerView` controls the current position for an episode using a `Slider`, and whether the episode is a favorite using a `Toggle`. The view projects the `currentPosition` and `isFavorite` properties of `Episode` into bindings that each of these views accept using dynamic member lookup.",
