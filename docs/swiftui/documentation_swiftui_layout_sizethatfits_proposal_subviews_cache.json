The container’s parent view that calls this method might call the method more than once with different proposals to learn more about the container’s flexibility before deciding which proposal to use for placement.\n- **subviews**: A collection of proxies that represent the views that the container arranges. You can use the proxies in the collection to get information about the subviews as you determine how much space the container needs to display them.\n- **cache**: Optional storage for calculated data that you can share among the methods of your custom layout container.
