If you can’t achieve your design with composition alone, fine tune the layout with view modifiers. Add an offset modifier to shift the rendered content of a view from its current position, or a position modifier to set an explicit position within its parent.\n\n### Create a view layout\n\nThe following example provides a view to illustrate how to position views, providing a rough layout of views composed within a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ZStack]. The stack contains a quadrant with an overlaid circle image:\n\n```swift\nstruct Crosshairs: View { ... } \/\/ Draws crosshairs.\n\nstruct Quadrant: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        ZStack {\n            Crosshairs()\n            Rectangle()\n                .stroke(Color.primary)\n            Image(systemName: \"circle\")\n        }\n        .frame(width: 160, height: 160)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nFor more detail on composing views with stacks, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Building-Layouts-with-Stack-Views].\n\n### Shift the location of a view’s content\n\nFine-tune the position of the circle within the quadrant by using an offset modifier to shift where the parent view places the circle. An offset modifier shifts the image from its default center position. For example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/offset(x:y:)] modifier uses the parameters of `x` and `y` to represent a relative location within the view’s coordinate space.\n\nIn SwiftUI, the view’s coordinate space uses `x` to represent a horizontal direction and `y` to represent a vertical direction.

Don’t assume the leading edge is always on the left, because it changes with the layout direction. When the layout direction is set to right-to-left, the `0` horizontal value is on the right side of the view.\n\nThe following diagram shows the coordinates in the left-to-right layout direction against a rectangle, with the origin at the top, leading corner:\n\n\n\nThe following example shifts the circle `40` points from the center, up and toward the trailing edge:\n\n```swift\nstruct Quadrant: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        ZStack {\n            Crosshairs()\n            Rectangle()\n                .stroke(Color.primary)\n            Image(systemName: \"circle\")\n                .offset(x: 40.0, y: -40.0)\n        }\n        .frame(width: 160, height: 160)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Position view content explicitly\n\nTo explicitly position elements within a view, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/position(x:y:)] view modifier. A position modifier overrides where the parent view places its content. The modifier renders the view at a location offset from the origin of the parent view, unlike an offset modifier that shifts the view from the location chosen by the parent view. The position modifier uses the same `x`, `y` coordinate system as the offset modifier, and similarly doesn’t influence the size of the view. In this example, the position of the circle is set halfway down on the right side of the quadrant with explicit values:\n\n```swift\nstruct Quadrant: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        ZStack {\n            Crosshairs()\n            Rectangle()\n                .stroke(Color.primary)\n            Image(systemName: \"circle\")\n                .position(x: 144, y: 80)\n        }\n        .frame(width: 160, height: 160)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Adjusting a view’s position\n\n- **position(_:)**: Positions the center of this view at the specified point in its parent’s coordinate space.\n- **position(x:y:)**: Positions the center of this view at the specified coordinates in its parent’s coordinate space.\n- **offset(_:)**: Offset this view by the horizontal and vertical amount specified in the offset parameter.\n- **offset(x:y:)**: Offset this view by the specified horizontal and vertical distances.\n- **offset(z:)**: Brings a view forward in Z by the provided distance in points.\n\n",
