If the Clipboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the Paste command doesn’t trigger.\n- **validator**: A handler that validates the command. This handler receives items from the Clipboard with the types you specify in the `supportedContentTypes`. Use this handler to decide whether the items are valid and preprocess them for the `action` closure. If you return `nil` instead, the Paste command doesn’t trigger.\n- **payloadAction**: The action to perform when the Paste command triggers.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that triggers `action` when the system Paste command is invoked, validating the Paste command with `validator`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nPass an array of uniform type identifiers to the `supportedContentTypes` parameter. Place the higher priority types closer to the beginning of the array. The Clipboard items that the `validator` closure receives have the most preferred type out of all the types the source supports.\n\nFor example, if your app can handle plain text and rich text, but you prefer rich text, place the rich text type first in the array.
