Direct touch areas passthrough touch events to the app rather than being handled through an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver. The modifier accepts an optional `AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions` option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.\n- **accessibilityZoomAction(_:)**: Adds an accessibility zoom action to the view. Actions allow assistive technologies, such as VoiceOver, to interact with the view by invoking the action.\n- **AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions**: An option set that defines the functionality of a view’s direct touch area.\n- **AccessibilityZoomGestureAction**: Position and direction information of a zoom gesture that someone performs with an assistive technology like VoiceOver.\n\n",
