People issue a Cut command by choosing Edit > Cut from the app’s menu, or by using the Command-X keyboard shortcut. The system enables the Cut command for your app when it detects cuttable content.\n\nFor example, the following code enables people to remove bird names from a list of birds:\n\n```swift\nstruct CuttableExample: View {\n    @State private var birds = [\"owl\", \"parrot\", \"swift\"]\n    @State private var selection: Set<String> = []\n\n    var body: some View {\n        List(birds, id: \\.self, selection: $selection) {\n            Text($0)\n        }\n        .cuttable(for: String.self) {\n            for bird in selection {\n                birds.removeAll(where: { $0 == bird })\n            }\n            return Array(selection)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen someone selects “owl” and issues a Cut command, the `action` closure removes the selected item from the list and returns it.
