If false, the timer displays minute values greather than sixty.\n- maxFieldCount: The number of fields that can be shown at once. For example, 1 hour, 34 minutes is shown as `1:34:00` by default, but as `1:34` if the `maxFieldCount` is set to two. The style automatically excludes more significant fields if their value is zero and they are not necessary for the format pattern, making room for less significant fields.\n- maxPrecision: The precision at which the input is formatted. E.g. by default, seconds are shown, making the maximum precision   one second. Setting the maximum precision to `.seconds(60)` would   only allow hours and minutes to be shown.\n\n",
