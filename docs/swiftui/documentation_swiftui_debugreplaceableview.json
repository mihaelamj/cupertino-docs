This type erasure can impact performance, especially when dealing with dynamic content (like content generated by a ForEach, or List) so any performance testing should be done in release mode.\n\nThis type acts similarly to an `AnyView` in that it type-erases its content, however it depends on the underlying type of the value not actually changing as it is in place of an opaque result type.
