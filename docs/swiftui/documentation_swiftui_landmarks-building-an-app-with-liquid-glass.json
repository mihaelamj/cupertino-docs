  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nLandmarks is a SwifUI app that demonstrates how to use the new dynamic and expressive design feature, Liquid Glass. The Landmarks app lets people explore interesting sites around the world. Whether it’s a national park near their home or a far-flung location on a different continent, the app provides a way for people to organize and mark their adventures and receive custom activity badges along the way. Landmarks runs on iPad, iPhone, and Mac.\n\n\n\nLandmarks uses a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/NavigationSplitView] to organize and navigate to content in the app, and demonstrates several key concepts to optimize the use of Liquid Glass:\n\nThe sample also demonstrates several techniques to use when changing window sizes, and for adding global search.\n\n## Apply a background extension effect\n\nThe sample applies a background extension effect to the featured landmark header in the top view, and the main image in the landmark detail view. This effect extends and blurs the image under the sidebar and inspector when they’re open, creating a full edge-to-edge experience.\n\n\n\nTo achieve this effect, the sample creates and configures an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image] that extends to both the leading and trailing edges of the containing view, and applies the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/backgroundExtensionEffect()] modifier to the image. For the featured image, the sample adds an overlay with a headline and button after the modifier, so that only the image extends under the sidebar and inspector.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Landmarks-Applying-a-background-extension-effect].\n\n## Extend horizontal scrolling under the sidebar\n\nWithin each continent section in `LandmarksView`, an instance of `LandmarkHorizontalListView` shows a horizontally scrolling list of landmark views. When open, the landmark views can scroll underneath the sidebar or inspector.\n\nTo achieve this effect, the app aligns the scroll views next to the leading and trailing edges of the containing view.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Landmarks-Extending-horizontal-scrolling-under-a-sidebar-or-inspector].\n\n## Refine the Liquid Glass in the toolbar\n\nIn `LandmarkDetailView`, the sample adds toolbar items for:\n\nThe system applies Liquid Glass to toolbar items automatically:\n\n\n\nThe sample also organizes the toolbar into related groups, instead of having all the buttons in one group. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Landmarks-Refining-the-system-provided-glass-effect-in-toolbars].\n\n## Display badges with Liquid Glass\n\nBadges provide people with a visual indicator of the activities they’ve recorded in the Landmarks app. When a person completes all four activities for a landmark, they earn that landmark’s badge. The sample uses custom Liquid Glass elements with badges, and shows how to coordinate animations with Liquid Glass.\n\n\n\nTo create a custom Liquid Glass badge, Landmarks uses a view with an `Image` to display a system symbol image for the badge. The badge has a background hexagon `Image` filled with a custom color. The badge view uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/glassEffect(_:in:)] modifier to apply Liquid Glass to the badge.\n\nTo demonstrate the morphing effect that the system provides with Liquid Glass animations, the sample organizes the badges and the toggle button into a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/GlassEffectContainer], and assigns each badge a unique [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/glassEffectID(_:in:)].\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Landmarks-Displaying-custom-activity-badges]. For information about building custom views with Liquid Glass, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Applying-Liquid-Glass-to-custom-views].\n\n## Create the app icon with Icon Composer\n\nLandmarks includes a dynamic and expressive app icon composed in Icon Composer. You build app icons with four layers that the system uses to produce specular highlights when a person moves their device, so that the icon responds as if light was reflecting off the glass. The Settings app allows people to personalize the icon by selecting light, dark, clear, or tinted variants of your app icon as well.\n\nFor more information on creating a new app icon, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/creating-your-app-icon-using-icon-composer].\n\nFor design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines >  [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/app-icons].",
