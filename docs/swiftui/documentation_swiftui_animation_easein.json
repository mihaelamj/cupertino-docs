With an ease in animation, the motion starts slowly and increases its speed towards the end.\n\nThe `easeIn` animation has a default duration of 0.35 seconds. To specify a different duration, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/easeIn(duration:)].\n\nThe following code shows an example of animating the size changes of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] using the ease in animation.",
