The method passes the non-`nil` element to the handler as a convenience so the handlers don’t all need to implement an early exit with `guard element = element else { return }`.\n- **update**: A function that modifies the passed-in activity for advertisement.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe scope of the activity applies only to the scene or window the view is in.\n\n## Sending and receiving user activities\n\n- **Restoring your app’s state with SwiftUI**: Provide app continuity for users by preserving their current activities.\n- **userActivity(_:isActive:_:)**: Advertises a user activity type.\n- **onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:)**: Registers a handler to invoke in response to a user activity that your app receives.\n\n",
