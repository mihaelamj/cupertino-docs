When `item` is non-`nil`, the system passes the contents to the modifier’s closure. You display this content in a sheet that you create that the system displays to the user. If `item` changes, the system dismisses the currently displayed sheet and replaces it with a new one using the same process.\n- **onDismiss**: The closure to execute when dismissing the modal view.\n- **content**: A closure returning the content of the modal view.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to display a modal view that covers as much of the screen as possible. In the example below a custom structure — `CoverData` — provides data for the full-screen view to display in the `content` closure when the user clicks or taps the “Present Full-Screen Cover With Data” button:\n\n```swift\nstruct FullScreenCoverItemOnDismissContent: View {\n    @State private var coverData: CoverData?\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Present Full-Screen Cover With Data\") {\n            coverData = CoverData(body: \"Custom Data\")\n        }\n        .fullScreenCover(item: $coverData,\n                         onDismiss: didDismiss) { details in\n            VStack(spacing: 20) {\n                Text(\"\\(details.body)\")\n            }\n            .onTapGesture {\n                coverData = nil\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func didDismiss() {\n        \/\/ Handle the dismissing action.\n    }\n\n}\n\nstruct CoverData: Identifiable {\n    var id: String {\n        return body\n    }\n    let body: String\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Showing a sheet, cover, or popover\n\n- **sheet(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a sheet when a binding to a Boolean value that you provide is true.\n- **sheet(item:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a sheet using the given item as a data source for the sheet’s content.\n- **fullScreenCover(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a modal view that covers as much of the screen as possible when binding to a Boolean value you provide is true.\n- **popover(item:attachmentAnchor:arrowEdge:content:)**: Presents a popover using the given item as a data source for the popover’s content.\n- **popover(isPresented:attachmentAnchor:arrowEdge:content:)**: Presents a popover when a given condition is true.\n- **PopoverAttachmentAnchor**: An attachment anchor for a popover.\n\n",
