Applying the `$` prefix to a property wrapped value returns its [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/State\/projectedValue], which for a state property wrapper returns a binding to the value.\n\nWhenever the user taps the `PlayButton`, the `PlayerView` updates its `isPlaying` state.\n\nA binding conforms to `Sendable` only if its wrapped value type also conforms to `Sendable`.

A binding connects a property to a source of truth stored elsewhere, instead of storing data directly. For example, a button that toggles between play and pause can create a binding to a property of its parent view using the `Binding` property wrapper.\n\n```swift\nstruct PlayButton: View {\n    @Binding var isPlaying: Bool\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(isPlaying ? \"Pause\" : \"Play\") {\n            isPlaying.toggle()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe parent view declares a property to hold the playing state, using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/State] property wrapper to indicate that this property is the value’s source of truth.\n\n```swift\nstruct PlayerView: View {\n    var episode: Episode\n    @State private var isPlaying: Bool = false\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Text(episode.title)\n                .foregroundStyle(isPlaying ? .primary : .secondary)\n            PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying) \/\/ Pass a binding.\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen `PlayerView` initializes `PlayButton`, it passes a binding of its state property into the button’s binding property. Applying the `$` prefix to a property wrapped value returns its [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/State\/projectedValue], which for a state property wrapper returns a binding to the value.\n\nWhenever the user taps the `PlayButton`, the `PlayerView` updates its `isPlaying` state.\n\nA binding conforms to `Sendable` only if its wrapped value type also conforms to `Sendable`. It is always safe to pass a sendable binding between different concurrency domains. However, reading from or writing to a binding’s wrapped value from a different concurrency domain may or may not be safe, depending on how the binding was created.
