  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe reference format is designed for referring to a certain date in the most natural way possible. The concrete format depends on the distance to the date. E.g. if an event is one minute away, most people would refer to it in a relative way, e.g. the event starts “in one minute”. However, if dates are really far away, it becomes easier to refer to them in an absolute way, e.g. the original iPhone was announced in “January 2007”.\n\nUse the style by initializing it with the date it should refer to and format it with the point of reference, usually the current time.",
