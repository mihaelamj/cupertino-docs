Corner insets may include pieces of system UI as well as the corner radii for windows and presentations. When a specific edge is provided the view is positioned to avoid insets from only the corners of that edge. When multiple corner edges overlap in the same axis the view will be positioned off the larger overlapping inset.\n\nThe modifier provides a `sizeToFit` parameter to indicate how the view should be sized when it has been offset from a corner inset. By default, `false` is provided, and the content’s size will be unchanged, only the position of the view’s content will be offset. When `true`, the content will attempt to size itself with a proposal using the remaining size of the original view subtracted from the overlapping corner insets.",
