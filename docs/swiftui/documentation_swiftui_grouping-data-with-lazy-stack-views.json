  "overview" : "## Overview\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/LazyHStack] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/LazyVStack] views are both able to display groups of views organized into logical sections, arranging their children in lines that grow horizontally and vertically, respectively. These stacks are “lazy” in that the stack views don’t create items until they need to be rendered onscreen. Like stack views, lazy stacks don’t include any inherent support for scrolling, and you should wrap lazy stack views in [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ScrollView] containers.\n\nTo group content or data inside a lazy stack view, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Section] instances as containers for collections of grouped views. [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Section] views don’t have any visual representation themselves but can contain header and footer views that can either scroll with the stack’s content or that you can pin to the top or bottom of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ScrollView].\n\nThe code samples in this article build a user interface for visualizing shades of primary colors. Each section in the stack represents a primary color, containing five subviews, each showing a different variation of the color.\n\n\n\n### Prepare your data\n\nAs with views contained within a stack, each [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Section] must be uniquely identifiable when iterated by [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ForEach]. In this example, `ColorData` instances represent the sections, and `ShadeData` instances represent the shades of each color inside a section. Both `ColorData` and `ShadeData` conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Identifiable] protocol.\n\n### Display sections with headers and footers\n\nThe `ColorSelectionView` below sets up an array containing `ColorData` instances for each primary color. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/LazyVStack] iterates over the array of color data to create sections, then iterates over the `variations` to create views from the shades.\n\nGroup data with [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Section] views and pass in a header or footer view with the `header` and `footer` properties. This example implements a `SectionHeaderView` as a header view, containing a semi-transparent stack view and the name of the section’s color in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] label.\n\nFor more information on using [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ForEach] to repeat views inside a stack, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Creating-Performant-Scrollable-Stacks].\n\n### Keep important information visible\n\nBy default, section header and footer views will scroll in sync with section content. If you want header and footer views to always remain visible, regardless of whether the top or bottom of the section is visible, then specify a set of [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PinnedScrollableViews] for the `pinnedViews` property of the lazy stack view.\n\nIn [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/LazyVStack] containers, headers attach to the top and footers to the bottom. In [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/LazyHStack] containers, headers attach to the leading edge and footers to the trailing edge.\n\nWith this change, section headers are pinned to the top of the view as the user begins to scroll.\n\n",
