When accessibility focus moves to the accessibility element of the modified view, the focus value is set to `true`. If the value is set to `true` programmatically, then accessibility focus will move to accessibility element of the modified view. The value will be set to `false` if accessibility focus leaves the accessibility element of the modified view, and accessibility focus will be dismissed automatically if the value is set to `false` programmatically.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe modified view.\n\n## Controlling focus\n\n- **accessibilityFocused(_:equals:)**: Modifies this view by binding its accessibility element’s focus state to the given state value.\n- **AccessibilityFocusState**: A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that SwiftUI updates as the focus of any active accessibility technology, such as VoiceOver, changes.\n\n",
