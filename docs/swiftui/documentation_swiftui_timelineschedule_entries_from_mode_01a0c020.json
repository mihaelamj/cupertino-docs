The method returns a sequence of dates in increasing order that represent points in time when the timeline view should update. Types that conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineSchedule] protocol, like the one returned by [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineSchedule\/periodic(from:by:)], or a custom schedule that you define, implement a custom version of this method to implement a particular kind of schedule.\n\nOne or more dates in the sequence might be before the given `startDate`, in which case the timeline view performs its first update at `startDate` using the entry that most closely precedes that date. For example, if in response to a `startDate` of `10:09:55`, the method returns a sequence with the values `10:09:00`, `10:10:00`, `10:11:00`, and so on, the timeline view performs an initial update at `10:09:55` (using the `10:09:00` entry), followed by another update at the beginning of every minute, starting at `10:10:00`.\n\nA type that conforms should adjust its behavior based on the `mode` when possible. For example, a periodic schedule providing updates for a timer could restrict updates to once per minute while in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineScheduleMode\/lowFrequency] mode:",
