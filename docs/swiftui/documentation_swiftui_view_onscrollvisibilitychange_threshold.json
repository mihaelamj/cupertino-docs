By default when the view has crossed more than 50% on-screen, the action will be called.\n- **action**: The action which will be called when the threshold has been reached.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this modifier to be informed when the view has crossed the provided threshold to be considered on\/off screen.\n\n```swift\nstruct VideoPlayer: View {\n    @State var playing: Bool\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Group {\n            \/\/ ...\n        }\n        .onScrollVisibilityChange(threshold: 0.2) { isVisible in\n            playing = isVisible\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen the view appears on-screen, the action will be called if the threshold has already been reached.\n\n## Responding to scroll view changes\n\n- **onScrollGeometryChange(for:of:action:)**: Adds an action to be performed when a value, created from a scroll geometry, changes.\n- **onScrollTargetVisibilityChange(idType:threshold:_:)**: Adds an action to be called with information about what views would be considered visible.\n- **onScrollPhaseChange(_:)**: Adds an action to perform when the scroll phase of the first scroll view in the hierarchy changes.\n- **ScrollGeometry**: A type that defines the geometry of a scroll view.\n- **ScrollPhase**: A type that describes the state of a scroll gesture of a scrollable view like a scroll view.\n- **ScrollPhaseChangeContext**: A type that provides you with more content when the phase of a scroll view changes.\n\n",
