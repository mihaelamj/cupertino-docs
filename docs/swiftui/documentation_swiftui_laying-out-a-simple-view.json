  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo create a layout for a view, start by composing a hierarchy of child views. Then, refine the size and spacing of the child views with configuration parameters, and by adding view modifiers, like those that affect a view’s frame and padding. To review how to compose layouts, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Building-Layouts-with-Stack-Views].\n\n### Establish a view hierarchy\n\nThe following example creates a view to display an incoming message from a messaging service. The view uses an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack] to collect a view that identifies the sender and another that provides the content of the message:\n\nThe following screenshot of a `MessageRow` view includes a border that shows its bounds. Note the large size of the circle, which fills the space available to it:\n\n\n\nWhen SwiftUI renders a view hierarchy, it recursively evaluates each child view: The parent view proposes a size to the child views it contains, and the child views respond with a computed size.\n\n\n\nThe `MessageRow` view proposes a size to its only child, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack], which is the full size proposed to it by its own parent. The stack proportionally divides this space between its child views, with system-default spacing between each child. This continues recursively:\n\nWhen all child views have reported their size, the parent view renders them. For a hands-on approach to learning how the SwiftUI view hierarchy works, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/tutorials\/SwiftUI\/building-lists-and-navigation] section in the Introducing SwiftUI tutorial.\n\n### Limit the view size\n\nIn the example above, SwiftUI has built-in views that manage size in different ways, including views that:\n\nYou can constrain a view to a fixed size by adding a frame modifier. For example, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/frame(width:height:alignment:)] modifier to limit the width the circle to `40` points:\n\nWhen you add a frame modifier, SwiftUI wraps the affected view, effectively adding a new view to the view hierarchy.\n\n\n\nWhen SwiftUI evaluates this new hierarchy, the frame modifier fixes the width of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ZStack] that it wraps by passing along the value you specified as its parameter. The remainder of the size evaluation proceeds as before, where the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] now expands to fill a smaller space, constrained by the frame’s 40 point width. This enables the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack] to provide more space to its other child, which displays the message text.\n\n\n\n### Position content with alignment\n\nIf you want the top of the circle aligned with the top of the message content text, you can refine the view by applying an alignment to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack]. To position the content vertically within the stack, specify the `alignment` parameter to [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/VerticalAlignment\/top]:\n\nWith the alignment applied, you get an unexpected result. The tops of the views don’t appear to align:\n\n\n\nHowever, if you select the circle in Xcode, or temporarily add a border to the circle, you can see the tops of the views do in fact align. For more information on inspecting the size of a view, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Inspecting-View-Layout].\n\n\n\nIn the previous section, you applied a frame with only a width constraint. SwiftUI drew a circle limited by that width. But because the height was left unspecified, the circle’s frame separately expanded to fill the available height, even though that extra space had no visible impact on the rendered circle. You can resolve this problem by adding an explicit `height` parameter:\n\nThe contents of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack] are now top aligned, although the stack itself is centered in the `MessageRow` view as shown by the border displaying the row’s boundaries.\n\n\n\n### Add padding to the view\n\nTo avoid visually crowding the outer edges of a view, add padding. This introduces a fixed amount of space along the specified edges, reducing the space available for the contents of the view by a corresponding amount. For example, you can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/padding(_:_:)] to add extra space along the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Edge\/Set\/horizontal] edges of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack]:\n\nThe padding modifier defaults to system-standard spacing, although you can alternatively choose different values for the padding modifier.

The view uses an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack] to collect a view that identifies the sender and another that provides the content of the message:\n\n```swift\nstruct MessageRow: View {\n    let message: Message\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack {\n            ZStack {\n                Circle()\n                    .fill(Color.yellow)\n                Text(message.initials)\n            }\n\n            Text(message.content)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe following screenshot of a `MessageRow` view includes a border that shows its bounds. Note the large size of the circle, which fills the space available to it:\n\n\n\nWhen SwiftUI renders a view hierarchy, it recursively evaluates each child view: The parent view proposes a size to the child views it contains, and the child views respond with a computed size.\n\n\n\nThe `MessageRow` view proposes a size to its only child, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack], which is the full size proposed to it by its own parent. The stack proportionally divides this space between its child views, with system-default spacing between each child. This continues recursively:\n\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ZStack] proposes a size to its child views, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] views.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] expands up to the size offered, while the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] takes just enough space for the string it contains.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ZStack] returns the size of its largest child view, in this case the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle].\n\nWhen all child views have reported their size, the parent view renders them. For a hands-on approach to learning how the SwiftUI view hierarchy works, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/tutorials\/SwiftUI\/building-lists-and-navigation] section in the Introducing SwiftUI tutorial.\n\n### Limit the view size\n\nIn the example above, SwiftUI has built-in views that manage size in different ways, including views that:\n\n- Expand to fill the space offered by their parent, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Color], [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/LinearGradient], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle].\n- Have an ideal size that varies according to their contents, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] and the container views.\n- Have an ideal size that never varies, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Toggle] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DatePicker].\n\nYou can constrain a view to a fixed size by adding a frame modifier. For example, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/frame(width:height:alignment:)] modifier to limit the width the circle to `40` points:\n\n```swift\nstruct MessageRow: View {\n    let message: Message\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack {\n            ZStack {\n                Circle()\n                    .fill(Color.yellow)\n                Text(message.initials)\n            }\n            .frame(width: 40)\n\n            Text(message.content)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you add a frame modifier, SwiftUI wraps the affected view, effectively adding a new view to the view hierarchy.\n\n\n\nWhen SwiftUI evaluates this new hierarchy, the frame modifier fixes the width of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ZStack] that it wraps by passing along the value you specified as its parameter.

The tops of the views don’t appear to align:\n\n\n\nHowever, if you select the circle in Xcode, or temporarily add a border to the circle, you can see the tops of the views do in fact align. For more information on inspecting the size of a view, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Inspecting-View-Layout].\n\n\n\nIn the previous section, you applied a frame with only a width constraint. SwiftUI drew a circle limited by that width. But because the height was left unspecified, the circle’s frame separately expanded to fill the available height, even though that extra space had no visible impact on the rendered circle. You can resolve this problem by adding an explicit `height` parameter:\n\n```swift\nstruct MessageRow: View {\n    let message: Message\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack(alignment: .top) {\n            ZStack {\n                Circle()\n                    .fill(Color.yellow)\n                Text(message.initials)\n            }\n            .frame(width: 40, height: 40)\n\n            Text(message.content)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe contents of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack] are now top aligned, although the stack itself is centered in the `MessageRow` view as shown by the border displaying the row’s boundaries.\n\n\n\n### Add padding to the view\n\nTo avoid visually crowding the outer edges of a view, add padding. This introduces a fixed amount of space along the specified edges, reducing the space available for the contents of the view by a corresponding amount. For example, you can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/padding(_:_:)] to add extra space along the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Edge\/Set\/horizontal] edges of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack]:\n\n```swift\nstruct MessageRow: View {\n    let message: Message\n\n    var body: some View {\n        HStack(alignment: .top) {\n            ZStack {\n                Circle()\n                    .fill(Color.yellow)\n                Text(message.initials)\n            }\n            .frame(width: 40, height: 40)\n\n            Text(message.content)\n        }\n        .padding([.horizontal])\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe padding modifier defaults to system-standard spacing, although you can alternatively choose different values for the padding modifier. \n\n## Finetuning a layout\n\n- **Inspecting view layout**: Determine the position and extent of a view using Xcode previews or by adding temporary borders.\n\n",
