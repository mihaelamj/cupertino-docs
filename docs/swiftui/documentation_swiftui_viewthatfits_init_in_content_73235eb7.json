The set may contain [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Axis\/horizontal], [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Axis\/vertical], or both of these. `ViewThatFits` chooses the first child whose size fits within the proposed size on these axes. If `axes` is an empty set, `ViewThatFits` uses the first child view. By default, `ViewThatFits` uses both axes.\n- **content**: A view builder that provides the child views for this container, in order of preference. The builder chooses the first child view that fits within the proposed width, height, or both, as defined by `axes`.\n\n",
