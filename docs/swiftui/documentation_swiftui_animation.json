  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn `Animation` provides a visual transition of a view when a state value changes from one value to another. The characteristics of this transition vary according to the animation type. For instance, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/linear] animation provides a mechanical feel to the animation because its speed is consistent from start to finish. In contrast, an animation that uses easing, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/easeOut], offers a more natural feel by varying the acceleration of the animation.\n\nTo apply an animation to a view, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/animation(_:value:)] modifier, and specify both an animation type and the value to animate. For instance, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] view in the following code performs an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/easeIn] animation each time the state variable `scale` changes:\n\nWhen the value of `scale` changes, the modifier [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/scaleEffect(_:anchor:)] resizes [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] according to the new value. SwiftUI can animate the transition between sizes because [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Shape] protocol. Shapes in SwiftUI conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animatable] protocol, which describes how to animate a property of a view.\n\nIn addition to adding an animation to a view, you can also configure the animation by applying animation modifiers to the animation type. For example, you can:\n\nFor example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] view in the following code repeats the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/easeIn] animation three times by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)] modifier:\n\nA view can also perform an animation when a binding value changes. To specify the animation type on a binding, call its [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Binding\/animation(_:)] method. For example, the view in the following code performs a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/linear] animation, moving the box truck between the leading and trailing edges of the view. The truck moves each time a person clicks the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Toggle] control, which changes the value of the `$isTrailing` binding.",

For example, you can:\n\n- Delay the start of the animation by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/delay(_:)] modifier.\n- Repeat the animation by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/repeatForever(autoreverses:)] modifiers.\n- Change the speed of the animation by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/speed(_:)] modifier.\n\nFor example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] view in the following code repeats the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/easeIn] animation three times by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/repeatCount(_:autoreverses:)] modifier:\n\n```swift\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var scale = 0.5\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Circle()\n                .scaleEffect(scale)\n                .animation(.easeIn.repeatCount(3), value: scale)\n            HStack {\n                Button(\"+\") { scale += 0.1 }\n                Button(\"-\") { scale -= 0.1 }\n            }\n        }\n        .padding()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nA view can also perform an animation when a binding value changes.
