Use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/accessibilityFocused(_:equals:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/accessibilityFocused(_:)] in conjunction with this property wrapper to identify accessibility elements for which you want to get or set accessibility focus. When accessibility focus enters the modified accessibility element, the framework updates the wrapped value of this property to match a given prototype value. When accessibility focus leaves, SwiftUI resets the wrapped value of an optional property to `nil` or the wrapped value of a Boolean property to `false`. Setting the property’s value programmatically has the reverse effect, causing accessibility focus to move to whichever accessibility element is associated with the updated value.\n\nIn the example below, when `notification` changes, and its  `isPriority` property is `true`, the accessibility focus moves to the notification `Text` element above the rest of the view’s content:\n\nTo allow for cases where accessibility focus is completely absent from the tree of accessibility elements, or accessibility technologies are not active, the wrapped value must be either optional or Boolean.\n\nSome initializers of `AccessibilityFocusState` also allow specifying accessibility technologies, determining to which types of accessibility focus this binding applies.
