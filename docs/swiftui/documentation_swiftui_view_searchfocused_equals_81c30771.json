When focus moves to the associated search field, the binding sets the bound value to the corresponding match value. If a caller sets the state value programmatically to the matching value, then focus moves to the search field. When focus leaves the search field, the binding sets the bound value to `nil`. If a caller sets the value to `nil`, SwiftUI automatically dismisses focus.\n- **value**: The value to match against when determining whether the binding should change.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe modified view.\n\n## Discussion\n\nTo control focus by matching a simple boolean condition, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/searchFocused(_:)] modifier instead.\n\nFor more information about using searchable modifiers, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Adding-a-search-interface-to-your-app].\n\n## Managing focus state\n\n- **focused(_:equals:)**: Modifies this view by binding its focus state to the given state value.\n- **focused(_:)**: Modifies this view by binding its focus state to the given Boolean state value.\n- **isFocused**: Returns whether the nearest focusable ancestor has focus.\n- **FocusState**: A property wrapper type that can read and write a value that SwiftUI updates as the placement of focus within the scene changes.\n- **FocusedValue**: A property wrapper for observing values from the focused view or one of its ancestors.\n- **Entry()**: Creates an environment values, transaction, container values, or focused values entry.\n- **FocusedValueKey**: A protocol for identifier types used when publishing and observing focused values.\n- **FocusedBinding**: A convenience property wrapper for observing and automatically unwrapping state bindings from the focused view or one of its ancestors.\n- **searchFocused(_:)**: Modifies this view by binding the focus state of the search field associated with the nearest searchable modifier to the given Boolean value.\n\n",
