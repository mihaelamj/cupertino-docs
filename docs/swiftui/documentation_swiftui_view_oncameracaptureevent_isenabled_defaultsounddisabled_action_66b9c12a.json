Set this value to `false` when your application cannot or will not respond to the action callbacks to avoid non-interactive buttons or UI elements.\n- **defaultSoundDisabled**: A boolean value indicating whether or not the default sound is disabled.\n- **action**: An event handler called when either the primary or secondary events are triggered.\n\n## Discussion\n\nEvents may or may not be sent to applications based on the current system state. Backgrounded applications will not receive events, additionally events will only be sent to applications that are actively using the camera.\n\nIf an event from one source begins, then events from other sources will be ignored until the first event ends or is cancelled.\n\nThis API is for media capture use cases only.\n\n",
