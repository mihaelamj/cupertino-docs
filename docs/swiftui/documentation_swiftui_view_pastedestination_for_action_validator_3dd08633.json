The type must conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreTransferable\/Transferable] protocol.\n- **action**: The action to perform when someone uses the system’s Paste command to paste one or more items of the payload type. The closure takes one parameter, which is the array of items to paste.\n- **validator**: A closure that you implement to validate the data to paste. SwiftUI calls this before it calls the `action` closure, and passes in an array of items to validate. Inspect the items, and return an array that includes only those from the input array that you consider valid. The array that you return from this closure becomes the input to the `action` closure. If you return an empty array, SwiftUI doesn’t call the `action` closure.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that people can paste into using the system Paste command.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this modifier to paste one or more items into a view from the Clipboard when someone issues a Paste command.
