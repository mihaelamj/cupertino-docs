If the Clipboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the Paste command doesn’t trigger.\n- **payloadAction**: The action to perform when the Paste command triggers. The action closure’s parameter contains items from the Clipboard with the types you specify in the `supportedTypes` parameter.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that triggers `action` when a system Paste command occurs.\n\n## Discussion\n\nPass an array of uniform type identifiers to the `supportedTypes` parameter.
