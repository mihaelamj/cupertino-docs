  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA Boolean value of `true` if the animation should merge with the previous animation; otherwise, `false`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen a view creates a new animation on an animatable value that already has a running animation of the same animation type, the system calls the `shouldMerge(previous:value:time:context:)` method on the new instance to determine whether it can merge the two instance. Implement this method if the animation can merge with another instance. The default implementation returns `false`.\n\nIf `shouldMerge(previous:value:time:context:)` returns `true`, the system merges the new animation instance with the previous animation. The system provides to the new instance the state and elapsed time from the previous one. Then it removes the previous animation.\n\nIf this method returns `false`, the system doesn’t merge the animation with the previous one. Instead, both animations run together and the system combines their results.\n\nIf your custom animation needs to maintain state between calls to the `shouldMerge(previous:value:time:context:)` method, store the state data in `context`. This makes the data available to the method next time the system calls it. To learn more, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/AnimationContext].",
