Increasing this value will increase the spring’s effect: the attached object will be subject to more oscillations and greater overshoot, resulting in an increased settling duration. Decreasing the mass will reduce the spring effect: there will be fewer oscillations and a reduced overshoot, resulting in a decreased settling duration.",
