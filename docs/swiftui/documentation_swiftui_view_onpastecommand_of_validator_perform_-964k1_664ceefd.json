If the Clipboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the Paste command doesn’t trigger.\n- **validator**: A handler that validates the command. This handler receives items from the Clipboard with the types you specify in the `supportedTypes` parameter. Use this handler to decide whether the items are valid and preprocess them for the `action` closure. If you return `nil` instead, the Paste command doesn’t trigger.\n- **payloadAction**: The action to perform when the Paste command triggers.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that triggers `action` when the system Paste command is invoked, validating the Paste command with `validator`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nPass an array of uniform type identifiers to the `supportedTypes` parameter. Place the higher priority types closer to the beginning of the array.
