The method returns a sequence of equally spaced dates in increasing order that represent points in time when the timeline view should update.\n\nThe schedule defines its periodicity and phase aligment based on the parameters you pass to its [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PeriodicTimelineSchedule\/init(from:by:)] initializer. For example, for a `startDate` and `interval` of `10:09:30` and `60` seconds, the schedule prepares to issue dates half past each minute. The `startDate` that you pass to the `entries(from:mode:)` method then dictates the first date of the sequence as the beginning of the interval that the start date overlaps. Continuing the example above, a start date of `10:34:45` causes the first sequence entry to be `10:34:30`, because that’s the start of the interval in which the start date appears.",
