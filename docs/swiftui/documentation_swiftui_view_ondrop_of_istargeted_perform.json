If the drag-and-drop operation doesn’t contain any of the supported types, then this drop destination doesn’t activate and `isTargeted` doesn’t update.\n- **isTargeted**: A binding that updates when a drag and drop operation enters or exits the drop target area. The binding’s value is `true` when the cursor is inside the area, and `false` when the cursor is outside.\n- **action**: A closure that takes the dropped content and responds appropriately. The parameter to `action` contains the dropped items, with types specified by `supportedContentTypes`. Return `true` if the drop operation was successful; otherwise, return `false`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that provides a drop destination for a drag operation of the specified types.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe drop destination is the same size and position as this view.\n\nMake sure to start loading the contents of `NSItemProvider` instances within the scope of the `action` closure. Do not perform loading asynchronously on a different actor. Loading the contents may finish later, but it must start here. For security reasons, the drop receiver can access the dropped payload only before this closure returns.\n\n## Moving items using item providers\n\n- **itemProvider(_:)**: Provides a closure that vends the drag representation to be used for a particular data element.\n- **onDrag(_:preview:)**: Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.\n- **onDrag(_:)**: Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.\n- **onDrop(of:delegate:)**: Defines the destination of a drag and drop operation using behavior controlled by the delegate that you provide.\n- **DropDelegate**: An interface that you implement to interact with a drop operation in a view modified to accept drops.\n- **DropProposal**: The behavior of a drop.\n- **DropOperation**: Operation types that determine how a drag and drop session resolves when the user drops a drag item.\n- **DropInfo**: The current state of a drop.\n\n",
