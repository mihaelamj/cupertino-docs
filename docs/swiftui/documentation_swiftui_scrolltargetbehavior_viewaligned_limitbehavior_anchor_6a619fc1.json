In the following example, the scroll view always picks an item view to settle on.\n\nYou configure which views should be used for settling using the `View\/scrollTargetLayout()` modifier. Apply this modifier to a layout container like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/LazyVStack] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack] and each individual view in that layout will be considered for alignment.\n\nYou can customize whether the view aligned behavior limits the number of views that can be scrolled at a time by using the `ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.LimitBehavior` type. Provide a value of `ViewAlignedScrollTargetBehavior.LimitBehavior\/always` to always have the behavior only allow a few views to be scrolled at a time.\n\nYou can further customize how the view aligned behavior aligns the view within the visible region of the scroll view by providing a custom anchor.
