The configuration will be applied both while the view is coming into view and while it is disappearing (the transition is symmetrical).\n- **axis**: The axis of the containing scroll view over which the transition will be applied. The default value of `nil` uses the axis of the innermost containing scroll view, or `.vertical` if the innermost scroll view is scrollable along both axes.\n- **transition**: A closure that applies visual effects as a function of the provided phase.\n\n## Animating scroll transitions\n\n- **scrollTransition(topLeading:bottomTrailing:axis:transition:)**: Applies the given transition, animating between the phases of the transition as this view appears and disappears within the visible region of the containing scroll view.\n- **ScrollTransitionPhase**: The phases that a view transitions between when it scrolls among other views.\n- **ScrollTransitionConfiguration**: The configuration of a scroll transition that controls how a transition is applied as a view is scrolled through the visible region of a containing scroll view or other container.\n\n",
