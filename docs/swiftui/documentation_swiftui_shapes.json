Apply styles that include environment-aware colors, rich gradients, and material effects to the foreground, background, and outline of your shapes.\n\n\n\nIf you need the efficiency or flexibility of immediate mode drawing — for example, to create particle effects — use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Canvas] view instead.\n\n## Creating rectangular shapes\n\n- **Rectangle**: A rectangular shape aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n- **RoundedRectangle**: A rectangular shape with rounded corners, aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n- **RoundedCornerStyle**: Defines the shape of a rounded rectangle’s corners.\n- **RoundedRectangularShape**: A protocol of [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/InsettableShape] that describes a rounded rectangular shape.\n- **RoundedRectangularShapeCorners**: A type describing the corner styles of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/RoundedRectangularShape].\n- **UnevenRoundedRectangle**: A rectangular shape with rounded corners with different values, aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n- **RectangleCornerRadii**: Describes the corner radius values of a rounded rectangle with uneven corners.\n- **RectangleCornerInsets**: The inset sizes for the corners of a rectangle.\n- **ConcentricRectangle**: A shape that is replaced by a concentric version of the current container shape. If the container shape is a rectangle derived shape with four corners, this shape could choose to respect corners individually.\n\n## Creating circular shapes\n\n- **Circle**: A circle centered on the frame of the view containing it.\n- **Ellipse**: An ellipse aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n- **Capsule**: A capsule shape aligned inside the frame of the view containing it.\n\n## Drawing custom shapes\n\n- **Path**: The outline of a 2D shape.\n\n## Defining shape behavior\n\n- **ShapeView**: A view that provides a shape that you can use for drawing operations.\n- **Shape**: A 2D shape that you can use when drawing a view.\n- **AnyShape**: A type-erased shape value.\n- **ShapeRole**: Ways of styling a shape.\n- **StrokeStyle**: The characteristics of a stroke that traces a path.\n- **StrokeShapeView**: A shape provider that strokes its shape.\n- **StrokeBorderShapeView**: A shape provider that strokes the border of its shape.\n- **FillStyle**: A style for rasterizing vector shapes.\n- **FillShapeView**: A shape provider that fills its shape.\n\n## Transforming a shape\n\n- **ScaledShape**: A shape with a scale transform applied to it.\n- **RotatedShape**: A shape with a rotation transform applied to it.\n- **OffsetShape**: A shape with a translation offset transform applied to it.\n- **TransformedShape**: A shape with an affine transform applied to it.\n\n## Setting a container shape\n\n- **containerShape(_:)**: Sets the container shape to use for any container relative shape or concentric rectangle within this view.\n- **InsettableShape**: A shape type that is able to inset itself to produce another shape.\n- **ContainerRelativeShape**: A shape that is replaced by an inset version of the current container shape. If no container shape was defined, is replaced by a rectangle.\n\n## Views\n\n- **View fundamentals**: Define the visual elements of your app using a hierarchy of views.\n- **View configuration**: Adjust the characteristics of views in a hierarchy.\n- **View styles**: Apply built-in and custom appearances and behaviors to different types of views.\n- **Animations**: Create smooth visual updates in response to state changes.\n- **Text input and output**: Display formatted text and get text input from the user.\n- **Images**: Add images and symbols to your app’s user interface.\n- **Controls and indicators**: Display values and get user selections.\n- **Menus and commands**: Provide space-efficient, context-dependent access to commands and controls.\n- **Drawing and graphics**: Enhance your views with graphical effects and customized drawings.\n\n",
