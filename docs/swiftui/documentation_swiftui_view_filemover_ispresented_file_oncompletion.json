To access the received URLs, call `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource`. When the access is no longer required, call `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource`.\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n\nIn order for the interface to appear, both `isPresented` must be `true` and `file` must not be `nil`. When the operation is finished, `isPresented` will be set to `false` before `onCompletion` is called. If the user cancels the operation, `isPresented` will be set to `false` and `onCompletion` will not be called.\n\n## Moving a file\n\n- **fileMover(isPresented:files:onCompletion:)**: Presents a system interface for allowing the user to move a collection of existing files to a new location.\n- **fileMover(isPresented:file:onCompletion:onCancellation:)**: Presents a system dialog for allowing the user to move an existing file to a new location.\n- **fileMover(isPresented:files:onCompletion:onCancellation:)**: Presents a system dialog for allowing the user to move a collection of existing files to a new location.\n\n",
