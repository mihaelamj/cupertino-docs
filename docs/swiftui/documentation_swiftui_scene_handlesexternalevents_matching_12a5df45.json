  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA scene type that limits the kinds of external events for which SwiftUI opens a new instance.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen your app receives an external event like a user activity or a URL, SwiftUI routes the event to a scene for processing. SwiftUI selects the scene that receives the event according to the following rules, which it evaluates in order until it finds a destination scene:\n\nMake sure that at least one of these rules succeeds in your app for all events that your app claims to handle. Also, make sure that the scene that receives an event actually handles it. For example, be sure that a scene that receives user activities handles them with an appropriate [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:)] view modifier.\n\nDon’t confuse the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` scene modifier with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)] *view* modifier. You use the scene modifier to help SwiftUI choose a new scene to open when no open scene handles an external event, whereas you use the view modifier to indicate that an open scene can or prefers to handle certain events.\n\n### Matching an event\n\nTo find a scene type that handles a particular external event, SwiftUI compares a property of the event against the strings that you specify in the `conditions` set. SwiftUI examines the following event properties to perform the comparison:\n\nAn empty set of strings never matches. Similarly, empty strings never match. Conversely, as a special case, the string that contains only an asterisk (`*`) matches anything. The modifier performs string comparisons that are case and diacritic insensitive.\n\n### Choosing a window to open\n\nThe following example shows an app with a photo browser scene that displays a collection of photos, and a photo detail scene that enables closer examination of a particular photo:\n\nThe app uses the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` modifier on the second scene to ensure that an external event with an identifier that contains the string `photoIdentifier=` creates a new scene of the second type. Other events, if not handled by an open scene, cause the creation of a new browser window instead.",

SwiftUI selects the scene that receives the event according to the following rules, which it evaluates in order until it finds a destination scene:\n\n- On platforms that support only a single scene per app, send the event to the one open scene.\n- Find an open scene that indicates it prefers to or can handle the event, if any, and send the event to that scene. You use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)] view modifier on a view inside the scene to register this preference.\n- Find a scene declaration with a `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` scene modifier containing `conditions` that match the external event. Create a new instance of the first scene that matches and route the event there.\n- Find the first scene declaration that doesn’t have the scene modifier. Create a new instance of this scene and route the event there.\n\nMake sure that at least one of these rules succeeds in your app for all events that your app claims to handle. Also, make sure that the scene that receives an event actually handles it. For example, be sure that a scene that receives user activities handles them with an appropriate [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/onContinueUserActivity(_:perform:)] view modifier.\n\nDon’t confuse the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` scene modifier with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)] *view* modifier.

SwiftUI examines the following event properties to perform the comparison:\n\n- For an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity], like when your app handles Handoff, SwiftUI uses the activity’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/targetContentIdentifier] property, or if that’s `nil`, its [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/webpageURL] property rendered as an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL\/absoluteString].\n- For a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL], like when another process opens a URL that your app handles, SwiftUI uses the URL’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URL\/absoluteString].\n\nAn empty set of strings never matches. Similarly, empty strings never match. Conversely, as a special case, the string that contains only an asterisk (`*`) matches anything. The modifier performs string comparisons that are case and diacritic insensitive.\n\n\n\n### Choosing a window to open\n\nThe following example shows an app with a photo browser scene that displays a collection of photos, and a photo detail scene that enables closer examination of a particular photo:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct MyPhotos: App {\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            PhotosBrowser()\n        }\n\n        WindowGroup(\"Photo\") {\n            PhotoDetail()\n        }\n        .handlesExternalEvents(matching: [\"photoIdentifier=\"])\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe app uses the `handlesExternalEvents(matching:)` modifier on the second scene to ensure that an external event with an identifier that contains the string `photoIdentifier=` creates a new scene of the second type. Other events, if not handled by an open scene, cause the creation of a new browser window instead.\n\n## Handling external events\n\n- **handlesExternalEvents(preferring:allowing:)**: Specifies the external events that the view’s scene handles if the scene is already open.\n\n",
