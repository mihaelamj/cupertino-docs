When `item` is non-`nil`, the system passes the contents to the modifier’s closure. You use this content to populate the fields of a popover that you create that the system displays to the user. If `item` changes, the system dismisses the currently presented popover and replaces it with a new popover using the same process.\n- **attachmentAnchor**: The positioning anchor that defines the attachment point of the popover. The default is [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Anchor\/Source\/bounds].\n- **arrowEdge**: The edge of the `attachmentAnchor` that defines the location of the popover’s arrow. The default is `nil`, which results in the system allowing any arrow edge.\n- **content**: A closure returning the content of the popover.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when you need to present a popover with content from a custom data source. The example below uses data in the `PopoverModel` structure to populate the view in the `content` closure that the popover displays to the user:\n\n```swift\nstruct PopoverExample: View {\n    @State private var popover: PopoverModel?\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Show Popover\") {\n            popover = PopoverModel(message: \"Custom Message\")\n        }\n        .popover(item: $popover, arrowEdge: .bottom) { detail in\n            Text(\"\\(detail.message)\")\n                .padding()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct PopoverModel: Identifiable {\n    var id: String { message }\n    let message: String\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### Breakthrough effect\n\nIn visionOS, most system presentations appear with a breakthrough effect by default. To change how the enclosing presentation breaks through content occluding it, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/presentationBreakthroughEffect(_:)], like in the following example:\n\n```swift\n.popover(item: $popover) { detail in\n    Text(\"\\(detail.message)\")\n        .padding()\n        .presentationBreakthroughEffect(.prominent)\n}\n```\n\n## Showing a sheet, cover, or popover\n\n- **sheet(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a sheet when a binding to a Boolean value that you provide is true.\n- **sheet(item:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a sheet using the given item as a data source for the sheet’s content.\n- **fullScreenCover(isPresented:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a modal view that covers as much of the screen as possible when binding to a Boolean value you provide is true.\n- **fullScreenCover(item:onDismiss:content:)**: Presents a modal view that covers as much of the screen as possible using the binding you provide as a data source for the sheet’s content.\n- **popover(isPresented:attachmentAnchor:arrowEdge:content:)**: Presents a popover when a given condition is true.\n- **PopoverAttachmentAnchor**: An attachment anchor for a popover.\n\n",
