  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf the data you want to search falls into a few categories, you can define different scopes to help people narrow their search. When you define a scope, SwiftUI presents a picker that people can use to choose one of them. You then use the current scope selection as one of the inputs to the search operation.\n\n### Define the possible scopes\n\nStart by creating a type that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable] protocol to represent the possible scopes. For example, you can use an enumeration to scope a product search to just fruits or just vegetables:\n\nThen create a property to store the current scope, either as a state variable in a view, or a published property in your model:\n\n### Apply the scope\n\nTo use the scope information, bind the current scope to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/searchScopes(_:scopes:)] modifier. You also indicate a set of views that correspond to the different scopes. Like the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/searchSuggestions(_:)] modifier, the scopes modifier operates on the searchable modifier that’s closer to the modified view, so it needs to follow the searchable modifier:\n\nSwiftUI uses the binding and views to add a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Picker] to the search field. By default, the picker appears below the search field in macOS when search is active, or in iOS when someone starts entering text into the search field:\n\nYou can change when the picker appears by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/searchScopes(_:activation:_:)] modifier instead, and supplying one of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/SearchScopeActivation] values, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/SearchScopeActivation\/onTextEntry] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/SearchScopeActivation\/onSearchPresentation].\n\nTo ensure that the picker operates correctly, match the type of the scope binding with the type of each view’s tag. In the above example, both the `scope` input and the tags for each view have the type `ProductScope`.\n\n### Use the scope in your search\n\nModify your search to account for the current value of the `scope` property, if you offer it, along with the text and tokens in the query. For example, you might include the scope as one element of a predicate that you define for a Core Data fetch request. For more information about conducting a search, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Performing-a-search-operation].",
