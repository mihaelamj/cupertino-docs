Defaults to `true`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this modifier when you want VoiceOver to speak text as individual letters, character by character. This is important for text that is not meant to be spoken together, like:\n\n- An acronym that isn’t a word, like APPL, spoken as “A-P-P-L”.\n- A number representing a series of digits, like 25, spoken as “two-five” rather than “twenty-five”.\n\n## Configuring VoiceOver\n\n- **speechAdjustedPitch(_:)**: Raises or lowers the pitch of spoken text.\n- **speechAlwaysIncludesPunctuation(_:)**: Sets whether VoiceOver should always speak all punctuation in the text view.\n- **speechAnnouncementsQueued(_:)**: Controls whether to queue pending announcements behind existing speech rather than interrupting speech in progress.\n\n",
