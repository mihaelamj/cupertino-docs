For example, on iOS, the user may touch and hold the increment or decrement buttons on a stepper which causes the execution of the `onEditingChanged` closure at the start and end of the gesture.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this initializer to create a stepper that increments or decrements a binding to value by the step size you provide within the given bounds. By setting the bounds, you ensure that the value never goes below or above the lowest or highest value, respectively.\n\nThe example below shows a stepper that displays the effect of incrementing or decrementing a value with the step size of `step` with the bounds defined by `range`:\n\n```swift\nstruct StepperView: View {\n    @State private var value = 0\n    let step = 5\n    let range = 1...50\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Stepper(value: $value,\n                in: range,\n                step: step) {\n            Text(\"Current: \\(value) in \\(range.description) \" +\n                 \"stepping by \\(step)\")\n        }\n            .padding(10)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Creating a stepper over a range\n\n- **init(value:in:step:format:label:onEditingChanged:)**: Creates a stepper configured to increment or decrement a binding to a value using a step value and within a range of values you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.\n- **init(_:value:in:step:onEditingChanged:)**: Creates a stepper instance that increments and decrements a binding to a value, by a step size and within a closed range that you provide.\n- **init(_:value:in:step:format:onEditingChanged:)**: Creates a stepper instance that increments and decrements a binding to a value, by a step size and within a closed range that you provide, displaying its value with an applied format style.\n\n",
