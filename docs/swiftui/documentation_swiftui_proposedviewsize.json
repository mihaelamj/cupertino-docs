When you create a custom layout using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Layout] protocol, your layout container participates in this process using `ProposedViewSize` instances. The layout protocol’s methods take a proposed size input that you can take into account when arranging views and calculating the size of the composite container. Similarly, your layout proposes a size to each of its own subviews when it measures and places them.\n\nLayout containers typically measure their subviews by proposing several sizes and looking at the responses. The container can use this information to decide how to allocate space among its subviews. A layout might try the following special proposals:\n\nA layout might also try special cases for one dimension at a time. For example, an [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HStack] might measure the flexibility of its subviews’ widths, while using a fixed value for the height.",
