A value of `0` removes the effect of the hue, resulting in gray. As the value increases, the hue becomes more prominent.\n- **brightness**: A value in the range `0` to `1` that indicates how bright a color is. A value of `0` results in black, regardless of the other components. The color lightens as you increase this component.\n- **opacity**: An optional degree of opacity, given in the range `0` to `1`. A value of `0` means 100% transparency, while a value of `1` means 100% opacity. The default is `1`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis initializer creates a constant color that doesn’t change based on context. For example, it doesn’t have distinct light and dark appearances, unlike various system-defined colors, or a color that you load from an Asset Catalog with [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Color\/init(_:bundle:)].\n\n## Creating a color from component values\n\n- **init(_:white:opacity:)**: Creates a constant grayscale color.\n- **init(_:red:green:blue:opacity:)**: Creates a constant color from red, green, and blue component values.\n- **Color.RGBColorSpace**: A profile that specifies how to interpret a color value for display.\n\n",
