Appropriate for apps that provide direct audio feedback on touch that would conflict with speech feedback.\n\n## Creating a set of options\n\n- **init(rawValue:)**: Create a set of direct touch options\n\n## Making gestures accessible\n\n- **accessibilityActivationPoint(_:)**: The activation point for an element is the location assistive technologies use to initiate gestures.\n- **accessibilityActivationPoint(_:isEnabled:)**: The activation point for an element is the location assistive technologies use to initiate gestures.\n- **accessibilityDragPoint(_:description:)**: The point an assistive technology should use to begin a drag interaction.\n- **accessibilityDragPoint(_:description:isEnabled:)**: The point an assistive technology should use to begin a drag interaction.\n- **accessibilityDropPoint(_:description:)**: The point an assistive technology should use to end a drag interaction.\n- **accessibilityDropPoint(_:description:isEnabled:)**: The point an assistive technology should use to end a drag interaction.\n- **accessibilityDirectTouch(_:options:)**: Explicitly set whether this accessibility element is a direct touch area. Direct touch areas passthrough touch events to the app rather than being handled through an assistive technology, such as VoiceOver. The modifier accepts an optional `AccessibilityDirectTouchOptions` option set to customize the functionality of the direct touch area.\n- **accessibilityZoomAction(_:)**: Adds an accessibility zoom action to the view. Actions allow assistive technologies, such as VoiceOver, to interact with the view by invoking the action.\n- **AccessibilityZoomGestureAction**: Position and direction information of a zoom gesture that someone performs with an assistive technology like VoiceOver.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- Equatable\n- ExpressibleByArrayLiteral\n- OptionSet\n- RawRepresentable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n- SetAlgebra\n\n",
