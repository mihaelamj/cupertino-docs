The Boolean parameter to `onFocusChange` is `true` when the view is in focus; otherwise, it’s `false`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that sets whether a view is focusable, and triggers `onFocusChange` when the view gains or loses focus.\n\n## Input and events modifiers\n\n- **onChange(of:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform when the given value changes.\n- **onTapGesture(count:coordinateSpace:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a tap gesture, and provides the action with the location of the interaction.\n- **onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration:maximumDistance:pressing:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a long press gesture.\n- **onLongPressGesture(minimumDuration:pressing:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform when this view recognizes a long press gesture.\n- **onPasteCommand(of:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Paste command.\n- **onPasteCommand(of:validator:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Paste command with items that you validate.\n- **onDrop(of:delegate:)**: Defines the destination for a drag and drop operation with the same size and position as this view, with behavior controlled by the given delegate.\n- **onDrop(of:isTargeted:perform:)**: Defines the destination of a drag-and-drop operation that handles the dropped content with a closure that you specify.\n- **onContinuousHover(coordinateSpace:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform when the pointer enters, moves within, and exits the view’s bounds.\n\n",
