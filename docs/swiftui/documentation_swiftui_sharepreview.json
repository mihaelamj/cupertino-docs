  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse this type when sharing content that the system can’t preview automatically:\n\nYou can also provide a preview to speed up the sharing process. In the following example the preview appears immediately; if you omit the preview instead, the system fetches the link’s metadata over the network:\n\nYou can provide unique previews for each item in a collection of items that a `ShareLink` links to:\n\nThe share interface decides how to combine those previews.\n\nEach preview specifies text and images that describe an item of the type. The preview’s `image` parameter is typically a full-size representation of the item. For instance, if the system prepares a preview for a link to a webpage, the image might be the hero image on that webpage.\n\nThe preview’s `icon` parameter is typically a thumbnail-sized representation of the source of the item. For instance, if the system prepares a preview for a link to a webpage, the icon might be an image that represents the website overall.\n\nThe system may reuse a single preview representation for multiple previews, and show different images in each context.
