A non-`nil` but empty value denotes a node capable of having children that is currently childless, such as an empty directory in a file system. On the other hand, if the property at the key path is `nil`, then `data` is treated as a leaf node in the tree, like a regular file in a file system.\n- **rowContent**: A view builder that creates the view for a single row of the list.\n\n## Creating a list from hierarchical data\n\n- **init(_:children:selection:rowContent:)**: Creates a hierarchical list that computes its rows on demand from a binding to an underlying collection of identifiable data and allowing users to have exactly one row always selected.\n- **init(_:id:children:rowContent:)**: Creates a hierarchical list that identifies its rows based on a key path to the identifier of the underlying data.\n- **init(_:id:children:selection:rowContent:)**: Creates a hierarchical list that identifies its rows based on a key path to the identifier of the underlying data and allowing users to have exactly one row always selected.\n\n",
