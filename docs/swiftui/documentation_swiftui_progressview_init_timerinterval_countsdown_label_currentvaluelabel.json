  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nUse this initializer to create a view that shows continuous progress within a date range. The following example initializes a progress view with a range of `start...end`, where `start` is 30 seconds in the past and `end` is 90 seconds in the future. As a result, the progress view begins at 25 percent complete. This example also provides custom views for a descriptive label (Progress) and a current value label that shows the date range.\n\n\n\nBy default, the progress view empties as time passes from the start of the date range to the end, but you can use the `countsDown` parameter to create a progress view that fills as time passes, as the above example demonstrates.",
