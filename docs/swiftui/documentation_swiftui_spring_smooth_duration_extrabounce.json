This is approximately equal to the settling duration, but for very bouncy springs, will be the duration of the period of oscillation for the spring.\n- **extraBounce**: How much additional bounce should be added to the base bounce of 0.\n\n## Getting built-in springs\n\n- **bouncy**: A spring with a predefined duration and higher amount of bounce.\n- **bouncy(duration:extraBounce:)**: A spring with a predefined duration and higher amount of bounce that can be tuned.\n- **smooth**: A smooth spring with a predefined duration and no bounce.\n- **snappy**: A spring with a predefined duration and small amount of bounce that feels more snappy.\n- **snappy(duration:extraBounce:)**: A spring with a predefined duration and small amount of bounce that feels more snappy and can be tuned.\n\n",
