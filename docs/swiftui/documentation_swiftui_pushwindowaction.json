The requested scene will be center-aligned with the backgrounded scene. The requested scene will have a default size that matches the size of the backgrounded scene. Closing the requested window will result in the backgrounded scene reappearing.\n\nCall [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/dismissWindow] from the pushed window to dismiss the pushed window and show the backgrounded window.\n\nCalling this action from a pushed window is not allowed.\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/pushWindow] environment value to get the instance of this structure for a given [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Environment]. Then call the instance to push a window. You call the instance directly because it defines a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PushWindowAction\/callAsFunction(id:)] method that Swift calls when you call the instance.\n\nFor example, you can define a button that pushes a video preview from an editor window:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct VideoEditor: App {\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup(id: \"editor\") {\n            EditorView()\n        }\n\n        WindowGroup(id: \"viewer\") {\n            VideoView()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nstruct EditorView: View {\n    @Environment(\\.pushWindow) private var pushWindow\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Play\", systemImage: \"play.fill\") {\n            pushWindow(id: \"viewer\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou indicate which scene to push by providing one of the following:\n\n- A string identifier that you pass through the `id` parameter, as in the above example.\n- A `value` parameter that has a type that matches the type that you specify in the scene’s initializer.\n- Both an identifier and a value. This enables you to define multiple window groups that take input values of the same type, like a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UUID].\n\nUse the first option to target either a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WindowGroup] or a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Window] scene in your app that has a matching identifier. For a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WindowGroup], the system creates a new window for the group. If the window group presents data, the system provides the default value or `nil` to the window’s root view. If the targeted scene is a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Window], the system orders it to the front.\n\nUse the other two options to target a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/WindowGroup] and provide a value to present. If the interface already has a window from the group that is presenting the specified value, the system brings the window to the front. Otherwise, the system creates a new window and passes a binding to the specified value.\n\n## Instance Methods\n\n- **callAsFunction(id:)**: Pushes a window that is associated with the specified identifier.\n- **callAsFunction(id:value:)**: Pushes a window defined by the window group that presents the specified value type and that is associated with the specified identifier.\n- **callAsFunction(value:)**: Pushes a window defined by a window group that presents the type of the specified value.\n\n## Opening windows\n\n- **Presenting windows and spaces**: Open and close the scenes that make up your app’s interface.\n- **supportsMultipleWindows**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the current platform supports opening multiple windows.\n- **openWindow**: A window presentation action stored in a view’s environment.\n- **OpenWindowAction**: An action that presents a window.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
