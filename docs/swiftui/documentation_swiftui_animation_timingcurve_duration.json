  "overview" : "## Return Value\n\nA cubic Bézier timing curve animation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to create a timing curve based on the control points of a cubic Bézier curve. A cubic Bézier timing curve consists of a line whose starting point is `(0, 0)` and whose end point is `(1, 1)`. Two additional control points, `(p1x, p1y)` and `(p2x, p2y)`, define the shape of the curve.\n\nThe slope of the line defines the speed of the animation at that point in time. A steep slopes causes the animation to appear to run faster, while a shallower slope appears to run slower. The following illustration shows a timing curve where the animation starts and finishes fast, but appears slower through the middle section of the animation.\n\n\n\nThe following code uses the timing curve from the previous illustration to animate a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle] as its size changes.",
