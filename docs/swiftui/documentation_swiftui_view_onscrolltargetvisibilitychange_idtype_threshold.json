By default when the view has crossed more than 50% on-screen, the action will be called.\n- **action**: The action which will be called when the views within the scroll view cross the provided threshold. The callback will include which views are considered visible.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this modifier along with the modifier `View\/scrollTargetLayout()` to be informed when the views in the targetted scroll view have crossed the provided threshold to be considered on\/off screen.\n\n```swift\nScrollView {\n    LazyVStack {\n        ForEach(models) { model in\n            CardView(model: model)\n        }\n    }\n    .scrollTargetLayout()\n}\n.onScrollTargetVisibilityChange(for: Model.ID.self, threshold: 0.2) { onScreenCards in\n    \/\/ Disable video playback for cards that are offscreen...\n}\n```\n\n## Responding to scroll view changes\n\n- **onScrollGeometryChange(for:of:action:)**: Adds an action to be performed when a value, created from a scroll geometry, changes.\n- **onScrollVisibilityChange(threshold:_:)**: Adds an action to be called when the view crosses the threshold to be considered on\/off screen.\n- **onScrollPhaseChange(_:)**: Adds an action to perform when the scroll phase of the first scroll view in the hierarchy changes.\n- **ScrollGeometry**: A type that defines the geometry of a scroll view.\n- **ScrollPhase**: A type that describes the state of a scroll gesture of a scrollable view like a scroll view.\n- **ScrollPhaseChangeContext**: A type that provides you with more content when the phase of a scroll view changes.\n\n",
