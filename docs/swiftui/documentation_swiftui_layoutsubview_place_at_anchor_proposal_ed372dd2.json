You can use a built-in point, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UnitPoint\/center], or you can create a custom [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UnitPoint].\n- **proposal**: A proposed size for the subview. In SwiftUI, views choose their own size, but can take a size proposal from their parent view into account when doing so.\n\n## Discussion\n\nCall this method from your implementation of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Layout] protocol’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Layout\/placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)] method for each subview arranged by the layout.
