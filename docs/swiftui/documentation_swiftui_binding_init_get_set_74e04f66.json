It is always safe to pass a sendable binding between different concurrency domains. However, reading from or writing to a binding’s wrapped value from a different concurrency domain may or may not be safe, depending on how the binding was created. SwiftUI will issue a warning at runtime if it detects a binding being used in a way that may compromise data safety.\n\nFor a “computed” binding created using get and set closure parameters, the safety of accessing its wrapped value from a different concurrency domain depends on whether those closure arguments are isolated to a specific actor. For example, a computed binding with closure arguments that are known (or inferred) to be isolated to the main actor must only ever access its wrapped value on the main actor as well, even if the binding is also sendable.",
