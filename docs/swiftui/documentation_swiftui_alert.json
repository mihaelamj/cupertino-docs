The `content` closure you provide to this modifer produces a customized instance of the `Alert` type.\n\nIn the following example, a button presents a simple alert when tapped, by updating a local `showAlert` property that binds to the alert.\n\n\n\nTo customize the alert, add instances of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Alert\/Button] type, which provides standardized buttons for common tasks like canceling and performing destructive actions.
