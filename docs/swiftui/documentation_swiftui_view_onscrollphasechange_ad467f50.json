You can use the geometry to understand where the scroll view has come or gone between the phase changes and update dependent state on that information. In the following example, whether toolbar content is hidden is determined based on the direction of the last user initiated scroll.\n\nIf multiple scroll views are found within the view hierarchy, only the first one will invoke the closure you provide and a runtime issue will be logged.
