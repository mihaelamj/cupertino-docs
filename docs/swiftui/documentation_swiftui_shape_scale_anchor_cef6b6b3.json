A value of `0` scales the shape to have no size, `0.5` scales to half size in both dimensions, `2` scales to twice the regular size, and so on.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA scaled form of this shape.\n\n## Transforming a shape\n\n- **trim(from:to:)**: Trims this shape by a fractional amount based on its representation as a path.\n- **transform(_:)**: Applies an affine transform to this shape.\n- **size(_:)**: Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of `size`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).\n- **size(width:height:)**: Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of size `(width, height)`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).\n- **scale(x:y:anchor:)**: Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.\n- **rotation(_:anchor:)**: Rotates this shape around an anchor point at the angle you specify.\n- **offset(_:)**: Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.\n- **offset(x:y:)**: Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.\n\n",
