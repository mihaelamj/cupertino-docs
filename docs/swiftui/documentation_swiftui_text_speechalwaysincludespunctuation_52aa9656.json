You might use this for code or other text where the punctuation is relevant, or where you want VoiceOver to speak a verbatim transcription of the text you provide. For example, given the text:\n\nVoiceOver would speak “All the world apostrophe s a stage comma and all the men and women merely players semicolon”.\n\nBy default, VoiceOver voices punctuation based on surrounding context.",
