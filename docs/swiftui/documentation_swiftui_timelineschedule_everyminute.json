For example, if you create the timeline view at `10:09:38`, the schedule’s first entry is `10:09:00`. In response, the timeline view performs its first update immediately, providing the beginning of the current minute, namely `10:09:00`, as context to its content. Subsequent updates happen at the beginning of each minute that follows.\n\nThe schedule defines the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EveryMinuteTimelineSchedule\/Entries] structure to return the sequence of dates when the timeline view calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EveryMinuteTimelineSchedule\/entries(from:mode:)] method.",
