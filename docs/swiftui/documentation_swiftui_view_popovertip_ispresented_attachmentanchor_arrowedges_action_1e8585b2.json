This value can be changed to temporarily hide or show a currently displayable tip. If this value is `nil`, the popover will automatically be dismissed based on the tip’s status and display rules. If this value is `nil`, the popover will automatically be dismissed based on the tip’s status and display rules.\n- **attachmentAnchor**: The positioning anchor that defines the attachment point of the popover. The default is bounds.\n- **arrowEdges**: The edges that the popover’s arrow is allowed to be positioned.\n- **action**: The closure to perform when the user triggers a tip’s action.\n\n### Discussion\n\nUse this modifier to present a tip as a popover on an existing view when the tip becomes eligible for display.\n\n```swift\nstruct TrailRow: View {\n    let trail: Trail\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            HStack {\n                Text(trail.name)\n\n                Button(action: trail.favorite) {\n                    Image(systemName: \"star\")\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        .popoverTip(FavoriteTrailTip(), attachmentAnchor: .point(.center), arrowEdges: .vertical)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n",
