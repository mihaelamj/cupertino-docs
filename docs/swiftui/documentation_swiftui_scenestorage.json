The underlying data that backs `SceneStorage` is not available to you, so you must access it via the `SceneStorage` property wrapper. The system makes no guarantees as to when and how often the data will be persisted.\n\nEach `Scene` has its own notion of `SceneStorage`, so data is not shared between scenes.\n\nEnsure that the data you use with `SceneStorage` is lightweight. Data of a large size, such as model data, should not be stored in `SceneStorage`, as poor performance may result.\n\nIf the `Scene` is explicitly destroyed (e.g. the switcher snapshot is destroyed on iPadOS or the window is closed on macOS), the data is also destroyed.
