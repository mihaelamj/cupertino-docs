Negative numbers are to the left and positive numbers are to the right.\n- **y**: The vertical amount, in points, by which you offset the shape. Negative numbers are up and positive numbers are down.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA shape offset by the specified amount.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe following example renders two circles. It places one circle at its default position. The second circle is outlined with a stroke, positioned on top of the first circle and offset by 100 points to the left and 50 points below.\n\n```swift\nCircle()\n.overlay(\n    Circle()\n    .offset(x: -100, y: 50)\n    .stroke()\n)\n```\n\n## Transforming a shape\n\n- **trim(from:to:)**: Trims this shape by a fractional amount based on its representation as a path.\n- **transform(_:)**: Applies an affine transform to this shape.\n- **size(_:)**: Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of `size`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).\n- **size(width:height:)**: Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of size `(width, height)`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).\n- **scale(_:anchor:)**: Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.\n- **scale(x:y:anchor:)**: Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.\n- **rotation(_:anchor:)**: Rotates this shape around an anchor point at the angle you specify.\n- **offset(_:)**: Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.\n\n",
