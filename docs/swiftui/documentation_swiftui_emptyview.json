When absent, the child view’s type in the generic type parameter is `EmptyView`.\n\nThe following example creates an indeterminate [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ProgressView] without a label. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ProgressView] type declares two generic parameters, `Label` and `CurrentValueLabel`, for the types used by its subviews. When both subviews are absent, like they are here, the resulting type is `ProgressView<EmptyView, EmptyView>`, as indicated by the example’s output:",
