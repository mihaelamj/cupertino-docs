These constraints are only created when Auto Layout constraints are otherwise being used in the containing window.\n\nIf the NSHostingController is set as the `contentViewController` of an `NSWindow`, it will also update the window’s `contentMinSize` and `contentMaxSize` based on the minimum and maximum size of its SwiftUI content.\n\n`sizingOptions` defaults to `.standardBounds` (which includes `minSize`, `intrinsicContentSize`, and `maxSize`), but can be set to an explicit value to control this behavior. For instance, setting a value of `.minSize` will only create the constraints necessary to maintain the minimum size of the SwiftUI content, or setting a value of `[]` will create no constraints at all.\n\nIf a use case can make assumptions about the size of the `NSHostingController` relative to its displayed content, such as the always being displayed in a fixed frame, setting this to a value with fewer options can improve performance as it reduces the amount of layout measurements that need to be performed. If an `NSHostingController` has a `frame` that is smaller or larger than that required to display its SwiftUI content, the content will be centered within that frame.",
