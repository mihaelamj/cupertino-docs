Pressing the keyboard shortcut is equivalent to selecting the menu command.\n\nIn cases where a command already has a keyboard shortcut, the scene’s keyboard shortcut is used instead. For example, `WindowGroup` normally creates a File > New Window menu command whose keyboard shortcut is `⌘N`. The following code changes it to `⌥⌘N`:\n\n### Localization\n\nProvide a `localization` value to specify how this shortcut should be localized.\n\nGiven that `key` is always defined in relation to the US-English keyboard layout, it might be hard to reach on different international layouts. For example the shortcut `⌘[` works well for the US layout but is hard to reach for German users, where `[` is available by pressing `⌥5`, making users type `⌥⌘5`. The automatic keyboard shortcut remapping re-assigns the shortcut to an appropriate replacement, `⌘Ö` in this case.\n\nProviding the option [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/KeyboardShortcut\/Localization-swift.struct\/custom] disables the automatic localization for this shortcut to tell the system that internationalization is taken care of in a different way.",
