  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse this property wrapper in conjunction with [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:equals:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:)] to describe views whose appearance and contents relate to the location of focus in the scene. When focus enters the modified view, the wrapped value of this property updates to match a given prototype value. Similarly, when focus leaves, the wrapped value of this property resets to `nil` or `false`. Setting the property’s value programmatically has the reverse effect, causing focus to move to the view associated with the updated value.\n\nIn the following example of a simple login screen, when the user presses the Sign In button and one of the fields is still empty, focus moves to that field. Otherwise, the sign-in process proceeds.\n\nTo allow for cases where focus is completely absent from a view tree, the wrapped value must be either an optional or a Boolean. Set the focus binding to `false` or `nil` as appropriate to remove focus from all bound fields. You can also use this to remove focus from a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TextField] and thereby dismiss the keyboard.\n\n### Avoid ambiguous focus bindings\n\nThe same view can have multiple focus bindings. In the following example, setting `focusedField` to either `name` or `fullName` causes the field to receive focus:\n\nOn the other hand, binding the same value to two views is ambiguous. In the following example, two separate fields bind focus to the `name` value:\n\nIf the user moves focus to either field, the `focusedField` binding updates to `name`. However, if the app programmatically sets the value to `name`, SwiftUI chooses the first candidate, which in this case is the “Name” field. SwiftUI also emits a runtime warning in this case, since the repeated binding is likely a programmer error.\n\n### Nest focusable views\n\nIt is important to consider the difference between [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:equals:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:)] with nested focusable views.\n\nFor example, consider the following code:\n\nThe code above uses [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:)], which binds focus state to the given Boolean state value. [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:)] sets `containerIsFocused` to `true` both when the `VStack` itself receives focus and *just* the `TextField` that it contains receives focus. This behavior occurs because two independent instances of `@FocusState` are used to observe the focus state of the focusable `VStack` and the `TextField`. When the `VStack` does not have focus, SwiftUI checks the view hierarchy to find the closest view with focus to set the value for `containerIsFocused`. If the `TextField` contained within this `VStack` happens to be focused, [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:)] will set `containerIsFocused` to `true`.\n\nIf there is need to observe whether only the `VStack` has focus, but not the inner TextField, consider using [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:equals:)] instead, for more granular control.\n\nWith [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:equals:)], the above code can be rewritten as follows:\n\nWith [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:equals:)], it is possible to define a custom data structure to represent focus state. In this case, a `Focus` enumeration is used. It has two cases, one for the focusable `VStack` and another for the `TextField` it contains. [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:equals:)] binds focused to `.container` only when the `VStack` itself has focus, and to `.field` when the `TextField` has focus. Because now there is only one `@FocusState` property, SwiftUI is able to disambiguate between cases when `VStack` *contains* focus and *receives* focus itself.\n\nNote that both of the above approaches are acceptable. [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:equals:)] can be used to observe whether the given view currently receives focus. While [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/focused(_:)] can be used for the same purpose, additionally it can observe whether the given view contains focus.",
