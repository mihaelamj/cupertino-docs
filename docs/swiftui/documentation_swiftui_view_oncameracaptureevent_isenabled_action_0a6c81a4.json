Set this value to `false` when your application cannot or will not respond to the action callbacks to avoid non-interactive buttons or UI elements.\n- **action**: An event handler called when either the primary or secondary events are triggered.\n\n## Discussion\n\nEvents may or may not be sent to applications based on the current system state.
