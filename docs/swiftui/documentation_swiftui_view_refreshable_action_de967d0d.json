Views that detect the presence of the instance can change their appearance to provide a way for the user to execute the handler.\n\nFor example, when you apply this modifier on iOS and iPadOS to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/List], the list enables a standard pull-to-refresh gesture that refreshes the list contents. When the user drags the top of the scrollable area downward, the view reveals a progress indicator and executes the specified handler.
