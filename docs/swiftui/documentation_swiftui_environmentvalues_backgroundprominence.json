The property can be read and used for custom styled elements.\n\nIn the example below, a custom star rating element is in a list row alongside some text. When the row is selected and has an increased prominence appearance, the text and star rating will update their appearance, the star rating replacing its use of yellow with the standard `secondary` style.\n\nNote that the use of `backgroundProminence` was used by a view that was nested in additional stack containers within the row.
