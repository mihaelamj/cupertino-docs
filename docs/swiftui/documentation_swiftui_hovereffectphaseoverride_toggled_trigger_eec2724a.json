If the effect is `active`, this is equivalent to applying the `inactive` override (and vice versa). Hover effects may be applied outside the app process, so this override allows the current phase to be toggled without needing to know the current phase.\n\nThe `toggled` override changes the effect’s phase when first applied, and also whenever the given `Equatable` trigger value changes. This allows the effect’s phase to be toggled repeatedly.\n\nWhen applied to a group, all effects in the group will be affected (just like the `active` or `inactive` overrides). Applying overrides to multiple effects in the same group is undefined, due to it not being clear which override should be applied.",
