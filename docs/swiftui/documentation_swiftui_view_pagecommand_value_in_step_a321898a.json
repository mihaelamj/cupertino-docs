Defaults to 1.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this command to step through sections of a data model associated with a view by providing a binding to a value, a range, and step. If taking another step would cause the value to exceed the bounds, then the value remains unchanged.\n\nOn tvOS, the user triggers ‘pageUp’ and ‘pageDown’ commands by pressing a dedicated button on a connected remote. For example, you can let a user page through a TV programming guide using the channel buttons:\n\n```swift\nstruct GuideView: View {\n    @State private var pageOffset: Int = 0\n\n    var body: some View {\n        GuideContent(at: pageOffset)\n            .pageCommand(\n                value: $pageOffset,\n                in: 0...9,\n                step: 1)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Responding to commands\n\n- **onMoveCommand(perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to a move command, like when the user presses an arrow key on a Mac keyboard, or taps the edge of the Siri Remote when controlling an Apple TV.\n- **onDeleteCommand(perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Delete command, or pressing either the ⌫ (backspace) or ⌦ (forward delete) keys while the view has focus.\n- **onExitCommand(perform:)**: Sets up an action that triggers in response to receiving the exit command while the view has focus.\n- **onPlayPauseCommand(perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to the system’s Play\/Pause command.\n- **onCommand(_:perform:)**: Adds an action to perform in response to the given selector.\n- **MoveCommandDirection**: Specifies the direction of an arrow key movement.\n\n",
