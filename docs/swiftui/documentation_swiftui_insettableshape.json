This is equivalent to insetting `self` by `lineWidth \/ 2` and stroking the resulting shape with `lineWidth` as the line-width.\n- **strokeBorder(lineWidth:antialiased:)**: Returns a view that is the result of filling the `lineWidth`-sized border (aka inner stroke) of `self` with the foreground color. This is equivalent to insetting `self` by `lineWidth \/ 2` and stroking the resulting shape with `lineWidth` as the line-width.\n- **strokeBorder(_:style:antialiased:)**: Returns a view that is the result of insetting `self` by `style.lineWidth \/ 2`, stroking the resulting shape with `style`, and then filling with `content`.\n- **strokeBorder(style:antialiased:)**: Returns a view that is the result of insetting `self` by `style.lineWidth \/ 2`, stroking the resulting shape with `style`, and then filling with the foreground color.\n\n## Setting the inset\n\n- **inset(by:)**: Returns `self` inset by `amount`.\n- **InsetShape**: The type of the inset shape.\n\n## Setting a container shape\n\n- **containerShape(_:)**: Sets the container shape to use for any container relative shape or concentric rectangle within this view.\n- **ContainerRelativeShape**: A shape that is replaced by an inset version of the current container shape. If no container shape was defined, is replaced by a rectangle.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- Animatable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n- Shape\n- View\n\n## Inherited By\n\n- RoundedRectangularShape\n\n## Conforming Types\n\n- ButtonBorderShape\n- Capsule\n- Circle\n- ContainerRelativeShape\n- Ellipse\n- OffsetShape\n- Rectangle\n- RotatedShape\n- RoundedRectangle\n- UnevenRoundedRectangle\n\n",
