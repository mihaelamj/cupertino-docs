This should replace the selected subpart that was exported with `onExport`. Return `false` to indicate that there was a failure to receive the items.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the associated view supports selection, the exported item should reflect that selected subpart.\n\n```swift\n@State private var title: String\nvar body: some View {\n    Color.pink\n        .frame(width: 400, height: 400)\n        .exportableToServices([title]) { editedTitles\n            title = editedTitles.first ?? title\n            return !editedTitles.isEmpty\n        }\n}\n```\n\n## Importing and exporting transferable items\n\n- **importableFromServices(for:action:)**: Enables importing items from services, such as Continuity Camera on macOS.\n- **exportableToServices(_:)**: Exports items for consumption by shortcuts, quick actions, and services.\n\n",
