The point stores a value in each dimension that indicates the fraction of the view’s size in that dimension — measured from the view’s origin — where the point appears. For example, you can create a unit point that represents the center of any view by using the value `0.5` for each dimension:\n\n```swift\nlet unitPoint = UnitPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.5)\n```\n\nTo project the unit point into the rendered view’s coordinate space, multiply each component of the unit point with the corresponding component of the view’s size:\n\n```swift\nlet projectedPoint = CGPoint(\n    x: unitPoint.x * size.width,\n    y: unitPoint.y * size.height\n)\n```\n\nYou can perform this calculation yourself if you happen to know a view’s size, or if you want to use the unit point for some custom purpose, but SwiftUI typically does this for you to carry out operations that you request, like when you:\n\n- Transform a shape using a shape modifier. For example, to rotate a shape with [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Shape\/rotation(_:anchor:)], you indicate an anchor point that you want to rotate the shape around.\n- Override the alignment of the view in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Grid] cell using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/gridCellAnchor(_:)] view modifier. The grid aligns the projection of a unit point onto the view with the projection of the same unit point onto the cell.\n- Create a gradient that has a center, or start and stop points, relative to the shape that you are styling. See the gradient methods in [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ShapeStyle].\n\nYou can create custom unit points with explicit values, like the example above, or you can use one of the built-in unit points that SwiftUI provides, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UnitPoint\/zero], [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UnitPoint\/center], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/UnitPoint\/topTrailing].
