For example, you can update the face of an analog timer once per second:\n\nThe closure that creates the content receives an input of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineView\/Context] that you can use to customize the content’s appearance. The context includes the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineView\/Context\/date] that triggered the update. In the example above, the timeline view sends that date to an analog timer that you create so the timer view knows how to draw the hands on its face.\n\nThe context also includes a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineView\/Context\/cadence-swift.property] property that you can use to hide unnecessary detail. For example, you can use the cadence to decide when it’s appropriate to display the timer’s second hand:\n\nThe system might use a cadence that’s slower than the schedule’s update rate. For example, a view on watchOS might remain visible when the user lowers their wrist, but update less frequently, and thus require less detail.\n\nYou can define a custom schedule by creating a type that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TimelineSchedule] protocol, or use one of the built-in schedule types:\n\nFor a schedule containing only dates in the past, the timeline view shows the last date in the schedule.
