For example, in the following code, the animation moves a truck from one edge of the view to the other edge. It repeats this animation three times.\n\nThe first time the animation runs, the truck moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the view. The second time the animation runs, the truck moves from the trailing edge to the leading edge because `autoreverse` is `true`. If `autoreverse` were `false`, the truck would jump back to leading edge before moving to the trailing edge. The third time the animation runs, the truck moves from the leading to the trailing edge of the view.",

Each repeated sequence starts at the beginning when `autoreverse` is `false`.\n- **autoreverses**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the animation sequence plays in reverse after playing forward. Autoreverse counts towards the `repeatCount`. For instance, a `repeatCount` of one plays the animation forward once, but it doesn’t play in reverse even if `autoreverse` is `true`. When `autoreverse` is `true` and `repeatCount` is `2`, the animation moves forward, then reverses, then stops.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn animation that repeats for specific number of times.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to repeat the animation a specific number of times. For example, in the following code, the animation moves a truck from one edge of the view to the other edge. It repeats this animation three times.\n\n```swift\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var driveForward = true\n\n    private var driveAnimation: Animation {\n        .easeInOut\n        .repeatCount(3, autoreverses: true)\n        .speed(0.5)\n    }\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(alignment: driveForward ? .leading : .trailing, spacing: 40) {\n            Image(systemName: \"box.truck\")\n                .font(.system(size: 48))\n                .animation(driveAnimation, value: driveForward)\n\n            HStack {\n                Spacer()\n                Button(\"Animate\") {\n                    driveForward.toggle()\n                }\n                Spacer()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe first time the animation runs, the truck moves from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the view. The second time the animation runs, the truck moves from the trailing edge to the leading edge because `autoreverse` is `true`. If `autoreverse` were `false`, the truck would jump back to leading edge before moving to the trailing edge. The third time the animation runs, the truck moves from the leading to the trailing edge of the view.\n\n## Configuring an animation\n\n- **delay(_:)**: Delays the start of the animation by the specified number of seconds.\n- **repeatForever(autoreverses:)**: Repeats the animation for the lifespan of the view containing the animation.\n- **speed(_:)**: Changes the duration of an animation by adjusting its speed.\n\n",
