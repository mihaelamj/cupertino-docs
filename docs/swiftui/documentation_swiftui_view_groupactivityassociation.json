  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nWhen a group of people join a SharePlay activity with their spatial Personas, the system selects a common, primary scene to arrange their spatial Personas around. This association between the group activity and a primary scene in your app creates a shared space for the spatial Personas to interact in; enabling participants to gesture at the associated scene and understand each other. For more information about spatial Personas and  SharePlay on visionOS, see doc:adding-spatial-persona-support-to-an-activity.\n\nBy default, the system uses your scene’s activation conditions in concert with your activity’s `SceneAssociationBehavior` to select a scene to associate with the activity. You can specify a different scene or dynamically change the associated scene by using this modifier to set a view’s group activity association to `GroupActivityAssociationKind\/primary`.\n\nIf there are multiple scenes that are simultaneously configured with the primary group activity association, the most recently associated scene will be used. For example, if your app defines two windows and both contain views with the primary association kind, the most recently opened one will be used as the primary scene. If that second window is subsequently closed, the original window will be used again.\n\nYou can dynamically remove the group activity’s association with a view by setting the given kind to `nil` instead of `.primary`.",
