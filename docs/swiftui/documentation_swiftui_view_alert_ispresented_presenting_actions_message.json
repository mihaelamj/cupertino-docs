When the user presses or taps one of the alert’s actions, the system sets this value to `false` and dismisses.\n- **data**: An optional source of truth for the alert. The system passes the contents to the modifier’s closures. You use this data to populate the fields of an alert that you create that the system displays to the user.\n- **actions**: A [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ViewBuilder] returning the alert’s actions given the currently available data.\n- **message**: A [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ViewBuilder] returning the message for the alert given the currently available data.\n\n## Discussion\n\nFor the alert to appear, both `isPresented` must be `true` and `data` must not be `nil`.
