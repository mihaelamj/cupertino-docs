The default value is `[.down, .repeat]`.\n- **action**: The action to perform. The action receives a value describing the matched key event. Return `.handled` to consume the event and prevent further dispatch, or `.ignored` to allow dispatch to continue.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA modified view that binds hardware keyboard input when focused.\n\n## Responding to keyboard input\n\n- **onKeyPress(_:action:)**: Performs an action if the user presses a key on a hardware keyboard while the view has focus.\n- **onKeyPress(_:phases:action:)**: Performs an action if the user presses a key on a hardware keyboard while the view has focus.\n- **onKeyPress(characters:phases:action:)**: Performs an action if the user presses one or more keys on a hardware keyboard while the view has focus.\n- **onKeyPress(keys:phases:action:)**: Performs an action if the user presses one or more keys on a hardware keyboard while the view has focus.\n- **KeyPress**\n\n",
