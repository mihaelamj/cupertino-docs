You can animate other values by making your custom views conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animatable] protocol, and telling SwiftUI about the value you want to animate.\n\nWhen an animated state change results in adding or removing a view to or from the view hierarchy, you can tell SwiftUI how to transition the view into or out of place using built-in transitions that [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/AnyTransition] defines, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/AnyTransition\/slide] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/AnyTransition\/scale].
