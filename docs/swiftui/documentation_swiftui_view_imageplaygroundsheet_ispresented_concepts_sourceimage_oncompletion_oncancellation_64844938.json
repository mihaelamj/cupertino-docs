The person reviewing the image can change these prompts inside the creation UI.\n- **sourceImage**: Specify an existing image to use as source input for creating the new image. The person viewing the sheet can override the image you provide, and choose different images and concepts inside the creation UI. If you don’t provide a starting image, the system creates the new image using only the contents of the `concepts` parameter.\n- **onCompletion**: The block to receive the generated image. The block has no return value and receives the following parameter:\n\n\n- **onCancellation**: The block to execute when the person exits the creation UI without choosing an image. After executing this block, the system automatically dismisses the sheet.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAdd this modifier to a view to display the system’s image-creation sheet.
