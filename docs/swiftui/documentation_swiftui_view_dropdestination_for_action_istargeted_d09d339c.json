The first parameter to `action` contains the dropped items. The second parameter contains the drop location in this view’s coordinate space. Return `true` if the drop operation was successful; otherwise, return `false`.\n- **isTargeted**: A closure that is called when a drag and drop operation enters or exits the drop target area. The received value is `true` when the cursor is inside the area, and `false` when the cursor is outside.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA view that provides a drop destination for a drag operation of the specified type.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe dropped content can be provided as binary data, file URLs, or file promises.\n\nThe drop destination is the same size and position as this view.\n\n```swift\n@State private var isDropTargeted = false\n\nvar body: some View {\n    Color.pink\n        .frame(width: 400, height: 400)\n        .dropDestination(for: String.self) { receivedTitles, location in\n            animateDrop(at: location)\n            process(titles: receivedTitles)\n        } isTargeted: {\n            isDropTargeted = $0\n        }\n}\n\nfunc process(titles: [String]) { ... }\nfunc animateDrop(at: CGPoint) { ... }\n```\n\n## Moving transferable items\n\n- **draggable(_:)**: Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.\n- **draggable(_:preview:)**: Activates this view as the source of a drag and drop operation.\n\n",
