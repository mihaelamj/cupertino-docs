If the pasteboard doesn’t contain any of the supported types, the button becomes disabled.\n- **validator**: A handler that receives those contents of the pasteboard that conform to `supportedContentTypes`. Load and inspect these items to determine whether to validate the button. If you load a valid item, return it from this closure. If the pasteboard doesn’t contain any valid items, return `nil` to invalidate the button.\n- **payloadAction**: The handler called when the user clicks the button. This closure receives the preprocessed result of `validator`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSet the contents of `supportedContentTypes` in order of your app’s preference for its supported types. The Paste button takes the most-preferred type that the pasteboard source supports and delivers this to the `validator` closure.\n\n## Deprecated initializers\n\n- **init(supportedTypes:payloadAction:)**: Creates a Paste button that accepts specific types of data from the pasteboard.\n- **init(supportedTypes:validator:payloadAction:)**: Creates a Paste button that accepts specific types of data from the pasteboard, performing a custom validation of the data before sending it to your app.\n\n",
