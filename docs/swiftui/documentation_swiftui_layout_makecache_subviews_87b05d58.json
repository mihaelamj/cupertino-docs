You can use the proxies in the collection to get information about the subviews as you calculate values to store in the cache.\n\n## Return Value\n\nStorage for calculated data that you share among the methods of your custom layout container.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou can optionally use a cache to preserve calculated values across calls to a layout container’s methods.

Rely on the protocol’s default implementation of this method if you don’t need a cache.\n\nHowever you might find a cache useful when:\n\n- The layout container repeats complex, intermediate calculations across calls like [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Layout\/sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)], [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Layout\/placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Layout\/explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)]. You might be able to improve performance by calculating values once and storing them in a cache.\n- The layout container reads many [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/LayoutValueKey] values from subviews. It might be more efficient to do that once and store the results in the cache, rather than rereading the subviews’ values before each layout call.\n- You want to maintain working storage, like temporary Swift arrays, across calls into the layout, to minimize the number of allocation events.\n\nOnly implement a cache if profiling shows that it improves performance.\n\n### Initialize a cache\n\nImplement the `makeCache(subviews:)` method to create a cache.
