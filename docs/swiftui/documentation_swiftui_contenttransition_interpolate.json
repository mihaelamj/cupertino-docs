Matching glyph pairs can animate changes to their color, position, size, and any variable properties. Interpolation can apply within a [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Font\/Design] case, but not between cases, or between entirely different fonts. For example, you can interpolate a change between [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Font\/Weight\/thin] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Font\/Weight\/black] variations of a font, since these are both cases of [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Font\/Weight]. However, you can’t interpolate between the default design of a font and its Italic version, because these are different fonts. Any changes that can’t show an interpolated animation use an opacity animation instead.\n\nSymbol images created with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Image\/init(systemName:)] initializer work the same way as text: changes within the same symbol attempt to interpolate the symbol’s paths. When interpolation is unavailable, the system uses an opacity transition instead.",

In certain environments changes to the text will enable a nonstandard transition tailored to numeric characters that count up or down.\n- **numericText(value:)**: Creates a content transition intended to be used with `Text` views displaying numbers.\n- **opacity**: A content transition that indicates content fades from transparent to opaque on insertion, and from opaque to transparent on removal.\n- **symbolEffect**: A content transition that applies the default symbol effect transition to symbol images within the inserted or removed view hierarchy. Other views are unaffected by this transition.\n- **symbolEffect(_:options:)**: Creates a content transition that applies the symbol Replace animation to symbol images that it is applied to.\n\n",
