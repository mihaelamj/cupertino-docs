The person viewing the creation UI can edit the concepts from inside that UI. `concept: str` is equivalent to `concepts: [.text(str)]`.\n- **sourceImage**: Specify an existing image to use as source input for creating the new image. The person viewing the sheet can override the image you provide, and choose different images and concepts inside the creation UI. If you don’t provide a starting image, the system creates the new image using only the contents of the `concepts` parameter.\n- **onCompletion**: The block to receive the created image. The block has no return value and receives the following parameter:\n\n\n- **onCancellation**: The block to handle the cancellation of the image-creation process, when the user chooses to exit the creation UI without choosing any image. After executing this block, the system automatically dismisses the sheet.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAdd this modifier to a view to display the system’s image-creation sheet. When the variable in the `isPresented` parameter is `true`, the view presents the sheet. Present the sheet in situations where someone might want to generate a new image for their content.
