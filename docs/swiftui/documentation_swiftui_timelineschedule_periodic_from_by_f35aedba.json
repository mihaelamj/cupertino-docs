For a start date in the past, the view updates immediately, providing as context the date corresponding to the most recent interval boundary. The view then refreshes normally at subsequent interval boundaries. For a start date in the future, the view updates once with the current date, and then begins regular updates at the start date.\n\nThe schedule defines the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PeriodicTimelineSchedule\/Entries] structure to return the sequence of dates when the timeline view calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PeriodicTimelineSchedule\/entries(from:mode:)] method.",
