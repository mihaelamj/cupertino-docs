The default is [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftUI\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Alignment\/center].\n- **horizontalSpacing**: The horizontal distance between each cell, given in points. The value is `nil` by default, which results in a default distance between cells that’s appropriate for the platform.\n- **verticalSpacing**: The vertical distance between each cell, given in points. The value is `nil` by default, which results in a default distance between cells that’s appropriate for the platform.\n\n",
