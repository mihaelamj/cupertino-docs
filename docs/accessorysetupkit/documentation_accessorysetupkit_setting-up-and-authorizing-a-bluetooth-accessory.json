When you tap the “Add Dice” button, the app searches for dice and presents the set up AccessorySetupKit UI. AccessorySetupKit then authorizes and grants the app access to that accessory. After authorization, you can connect to the accessory and receive roll results until you decide to disconnect or remove authorization altogether.\n\n### Configure the sample code project\n\nBecause this sample app relies on using Bluetooth to connect with the accessory functionality, you can’t run this sample in Simulator — you’ll need to run it on a device.

Run the two targets on separate devices.\n2. In `ASKSampleAccessory`, tap “Power On”.\n3. In `ASKSample`, tap “Add Dice” and authorize the accessory using the AccessorySetupKit UI.\n\nThe accessory is now authorized for use in the app.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Discovering and configuring accessories**: Detect nearby accessories and facilitate their setup.\n- **ASAccessorySession**: A class to coordinate accessory discovery.\n\n",
