Instead, create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.virtualization\/documentation\/Virtualization\/VZVirtioTraditionalMemoryBalloonDeviceConfiguration] object and assign it to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.virtualization\/documentation\/Virtualization\/VZVirtualMachineConfiguration\/memoryBalloonDevices] property of your virtual machine configuration.
