Instead, Create ML leverages a *feature extractor*, which is another model that identifies a set of general but distinguishing image characteristics. You can either use Create ML’s `scenePrint` feature extractor or provide your own custom feature extractor.\n\nIn either case, you train your model to map the feature extractor’s output to labels in a process known as *transfer learning*. Your model effectively borrows the knowledge of the feature extractor to accelerate its own training process while requiring fewer training images.",
