  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis sample playground uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CreateML] framework to train two [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreML] models, a regressor and a classifier.\n\n\n\nThe playground imports a CSV file, which contains Martian housing data, into a data table. The data table contains the following columns of information about a habitat on Mars:\n\nThe playground trains the regressor and classifier models, each with a group of columns relevant to that model. Once trained, the regressor is ready to predict the price of a habitat, and the classifier is ready to predict the purpose of a habitat.\n\nThe playground concludes by saving each model to a file, ready for integration into an app.\n\n### Import the data\n\nUse any [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLDataTable] initializer to import your data in to a data table. In this sample, the playground initializes its first data table with the contents of the CSV file embedded within the playground.\n\nPass your data table to `print()` to see a pretty-printed sample of its contents in the console.\n\n### Isolate the relevant model data\n\nIf necessary, generate a new data table that includes only relevant columns for your model.\n\nFor example, to predict price, the playground’s regressor needs only four columns of the five original columns:\n\nThe playground generates a new data table, specifically tailored for the regressor, by passing an array of column names to the first data table’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLDataTable\/subscript(_:)].\n\nTo predict the purpose of a habitat, the classifier needs a similar group of columns:\n\n### Divide the data for training and evaluation\n\nIf you intend to evaluate your model after training, reserve some of your data table’s rows for evaluation by separating them from the training data. By evaluating your model with data not present for training, your model’s evaluation better represents its real-world performance.\n\nThe playground creates two data tables per model, one for evaluation and the other for training, by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLDataTable\/randomSplit(by:seed:)] method of [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLDataTable]. The method returns a tuple of two new data tables, each generated by randomly dividing the rows of the original data table. The size of the first data table in the tuple is determined by the `proportion` parameter, a floating point value between `0.0` and `1.0`. The second data table in the tuple contains the remaining data rows.\n\nIn this example, the playground sets aside 20% of each model’s data rows for evaluation, leaving the remaining 80% for training.\n\nThe amount of data your model needs for evaluation versus training will vary with each app. Generally, training your model with more examples leads to better performance.\n\n### Train the regressor\n\nThe playground trains the regressor by providing its initializer with the training data table and the name of the target column. The `targetColumn` parameter determines what information you want the model to provide in its predictions. The playground tells the regressor to predict the price of a habitat by specifying `price` as the model’s target column.\n\nDuring training, [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML] automatically sets aside a small percentage of the training data to use for validating the model’s progress during the training phase. The training process gauges the model’s performance based on the validation data. Depending on the validation accuracy, the training algorithm can adjust values within the model or even stop the training process, if the accuracy is high enough. Because the split is done randomly, you might get a different result each time you train a model.\n\n### Evaluate the regressor\n\nTo see how accurately the regressor performed during training and validation, the playground gets the [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLRegressorMetrics\/maximumError] property of its [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLRegressor\/trainingMetrics] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLRegressor\/validationMetrics] properties.\n\nThe playground evaluates the regressor’s performance by passing its evaluation data table.\n\nIf your regressor’s evaluation performance isn’t good enough, you may need to:\n\n### Train the classifier\n\nThe playground trains the classifier to predict the purpose of a habitat. It does so by targeting a classifier on the `purpose` column of its training data table.\n\nA classifier can only predict values provided in its training data, unlike a regressor, which can predict numeric values beyond those in its training data. For example, the playground’s classifier can only predict a value of `\"power\"`, `\"farm\"`, or `\"general\"` because those are the only values in the `purpose` column.\n\n### Evaluate the classifier\n\nTo see how accurately the classifier performed during training and validation, the playground gets the [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLClassifierMetrics\/classificationError] property of its [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLClassifier\/trainingMetrics] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLClassifier\/validationMetrics] properties.\n\nJust as with the regressor, the playground evaluates the classifier’s performance by passing its evaluation data table.\n\nIf your classifier’s evaluation performance isn’t good enough, you may need to:\n\n### Save the model\n\nWhen you are satisfied with your modelʼs performance, save it to a file for later use in your app. The playground saves the price regressor, along with metadata, to the user’s desktop with its [doc:\/\/com.apple.createml\/documentation\/CreateML\/MLRegressor\/write(to:metadata:)] method.\n\nThe playground similarly saves the purpose classifier to the user’s desktop.\n\n### Add the model to an app\n\nTo add your model to an app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreML\/integrating-a-core-ml-model-into-your-app].",
