  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nCharts and graphs help users quickly identify important features and trends in data. Use the audio graphs API to provide all the information that VoiceOver needs to construct an audible representation of the data in your charts and graphs, making the data accessible to people who are blind or have low vision.\n\n\n\nAn *audio graph* turns the data in your chart into an audible representation by encoding the data on each axis as audio. Typically, the audio graph represents the x-axis as time, and the y-axis as pitch. For example, an audible representation of a scatter plot that shows a linear downward trend might be a series of individual tones descending in pitch over time. An audible representation of a stock chart might be a single continuous tone with a pitch that modulates up or down with the stock price (y-axis) as the audio plays over time (x-axis).",
