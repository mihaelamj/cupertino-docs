This effect allows the content to remain in the same position, no matter where the person looks. However, some assistive technologies are incompatible with this type of content. For example, a technology might use the person’s head movements to control the current selection. Anchoring content to the head position prevents affected technologies from interacting with that content.\n\nIf your app contains head-anchored content, call this function before you display that content. If the function returns `true`, find alternate ways to display your content. For example, display it in a regular window.",
