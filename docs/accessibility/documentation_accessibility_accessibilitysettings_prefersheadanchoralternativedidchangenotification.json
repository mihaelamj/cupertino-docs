When you receive this notification, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.Accessibility\/documentation\/Accessibility\/AccessibilitySettings\/prefersHeadAnchorAlternative] to get the new setting.\n\nOn Apple Vision Pro, apps can create a heads-up display effect by setting up content to follow the person’s head position. This effect allows the content to remain in the same position, no matter where the person looks. However, some assistive technologies are incompatible with this type of content. For example, a technology might use the person’s head movements to control the current selection, or they might magnify content to make it easier to read. Anchoring content to the head position prevents these technologies from interacting with that content.",
