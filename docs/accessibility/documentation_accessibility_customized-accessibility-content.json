Using this API allows you to leverage assistive technologies to present only the accessible content your app’s users need, when they need it.\n\nFor example, in a photography app, you may want the user to know the date, time, orientation, and shutter speed for a photo. However, the user might not always need that complete set of information. Using the custom content provider in your app lets the user experience the content in way that’s more appropriate for an assistive technology.",
