You generate JWTs using an API key downloaded from App Store Connect.\n\nAn API key has two parts: a public portion that Apple keeps, and a private key that you download. You can use the private key to sign tokens that authorize access to your data in App Store Connect and the Apple Developer website.\n\nThere are two types of API keys:\n\nApp Store Connect API keys are unique to the App Store Connect API and you can’t use them for other Apple services.\n\n### Generate a Team Key and Assign It a Role\n\nWhen you create an API key, assign it a role that determines the key’s access to areas of the App Store Connect API and permissions for performing tasks. For example, keys with the Admin role have broad permissions and can do things like create new users and delete users. Team API keys can access all apps, regardless of their role. The roles that apply to keys are the same roles that apply to users on your team; for more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/support\/roles\/].\n\nTo generate team keys, you must have an Admin account in App Store Connect. You can generate multiple API keys with any roles you choose.\n\nTo generate a team API key to use with the App Store Connect API, log in to [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/] and:\n\nThe new key’s name, key ID, a download link, and other information appears on the page.\n\n### Download and Store a Team Private Key\n\nOnce you generate your API key, you can download the private half of the key. The private key is available for download a single time, to begin log in to [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/] and:\n\nThe download link only appears if you haven’t downloaded the private key. Apple doesn’t keep a copy of the private key.\n\n### Generate an Individual Key\n\nTo generate an individual API key, which has access and permissions of the associated user, for the App Store Connect API, log in to [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/] and:\n\nThe key ID, a download link, and other information appears on the page.\n\n### Download and Store an Individual Private Key\n\nOnce you’ve generated your API key, you can download the private half of the key.

Select Users and Access, and then select the Integrations tab.\n2. Select App Store Connect API in the left column.\n3. Make sure the Team Keys tab is selected.\n4. Click Generate API Key or the Add (+) button.\n5. Enter a name for the key. The name is for your reference only and isn’t part of the key itself.\n6. Under Access, select the role for the key.\n7.
