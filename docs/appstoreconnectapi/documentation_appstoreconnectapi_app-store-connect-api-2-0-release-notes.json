The [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/promoted-purchases] resources can now manage promoted in-app purchases and auto-renewable subscriptions, including their visibility and images. The resources in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/in-app-purchase-and-subscription-app-store-review-submissions] collection manage submissions for review.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/customer-reviews] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/customer-review-responses] resources support retrieving customer reviews for your app that appear on the App Store, and managing your responses to the customer reviews.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/power-and-performance-metrics-and-logs] adds a new `HANGS` diagnostic type filter for [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-builds-_id_-diagnosticSignatures], updates the schema for responses in [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/xcodeMetrics], and adds support for long-lived tokens as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/generating-tokens-for-api-requests].\n\n### Deprecations\n\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-inAppPurchases] endpoint is now deprecated and replaced with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-inAppPurchasesV2] endpoint.\n\n### Removals\n\n- App Store Connect APIs for declaring IDFA usage are now removed. In your app, APIs that offer IDFA functionality are still available but require obtaining the user’s permission using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppTrackingTransparency]. You may also need to provide information about IDFA usage in your app’s privacy details on the App Store. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/user-privacy-and-data-use\/] and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/app-privacy-details\/].\n\n## Versions\n\n- **App Store Connect API 4.1 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 4.0 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.8 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.7 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.6 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.5 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.4 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.3 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.2 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.1 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.0 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.4 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.3 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.2 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.1 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n\n",
