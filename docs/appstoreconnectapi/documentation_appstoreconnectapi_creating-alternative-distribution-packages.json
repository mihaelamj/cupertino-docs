These notifications alert the marketplace when there are certain changes to your apps — for example, when a new alternative distribution package is generated. For more information on managing notifications, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/notifications].\n\nAfter your app is approved by App Review, and after you add it to a marketplace integration in App Store Connect, you need to create the alternative distribution package. Start by finding the app Apple ID for your app by using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps] and searching the resulting pages for the name of the app you want. In the response, make note of the `id` of that app, which appears in the following format:\n\nYou can also find the app Apple ID by going to App Store Connect > My Apps > Select an app > App Information > Apple ID. Next, look up the `appStoreVersion` by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-appStoreVersions] using the app Apple ID. Then, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-alternativeDistributionPackages] using the `data.relationships.appStoreVersion.id` from the previous response. Use the sample payload below as a guide:\n\nIf you opt-in to notifications, and the associated marketplace has set up webhooks with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-marketplaceWebhooks] endpoint, the marketplace is notified that a new alternative distribution package is available. If you did not opt-in, you’ll need to provide the alternative distribution package ID to the marketplace.\n\nIf you manage an alternative marketplace, you can get the alternative distribution package ID either from a notification from the webhooks API or manually from the app developer. A marketplace can’t generate alternative distribution packages on behalf of the app developer. The marketplace developer uses the App Store Connect API key associated with the marketplace provider’s account to download ADPs.\n\nTo learn more about server-side processing of marketplace webhooks, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/appdistribution\/processing-alternative-marketplace-notifications].\n\n### Create and manage alternative distribution packages for web distribution apps\n\nAfter your web distribution app is approved by App Review, you need to create the alternative distribution package. Start by finding the app Apple ID for your app by using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps] and searching the resulting pages for the name of the app you want.

Use the sample payload below as a guide:\n\nTo learn more about next steps for your web distribution app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/appdistribution\/installing-your-app-from-your-website].\n\n### Select the most recent distribution package\n\nOnly one alternative distribution package can exist for an `appStoreVersion.` It’s possible that you might have multiple versions of an alternative distribution package. To ensure you’re selecting the most recent `alternativeDistributionPackageVersion` when there are multiple versions available, use `filter[state]=COMPLETED` when calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-alternativeDistributionPackages-_id_-versions] endpoint.",
