Accessibility declarations enable you to show the accessibility modalities and the specific features that your app supports. Once you create an accessibility declaration, your App Store page shows the accessibility details for your app. You make accessibility declarations for each app and these apply to a device family, such as `IPHONE`, `IPAD`, or `VISION`, to learn more, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/DeviceFamily].\n\nUse this term list and table to understand what details to include in your app’s accessibility declaration.\n\n### Read accessibility feature details\n\nHere’s what each accessibility feature provides:\n\n### Read accessibility feature device family compatibility\n\nThis table shows the compatibility for each accessibility feature and platform:\n\n### Create an accessibility declarations for your app\n\nAfter you determine the accessibility features your app supoorts, create an accessibility declaration, by using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-accessibilityDeclarations] with a payload.\n\nHere’s an example payload:\n\nThe response includes a unique identifier.\n\nEach device family your app supports can have their own accessibility declaration.
