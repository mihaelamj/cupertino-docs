This API provides access to reports in these categories:\n\n### Understand roles and reports\n\nTo download analytics reports, be sure your API key has one of the following roles, because each role has access to specific endpoints:\n\n### Request analytics reports\n\nStart by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-analyticsReportRequests] API to request generation of reports for one of your apps. There are two types of `accessTypes` for report requests:\n\nYour first report request generates in 1–2 days. Subsequent `ONGOING` reports are available daily.\n\nTo see a list of your report requests, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-analyticsReportRequests].\n\nTo read more information about a specific request, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-analyticsReportRequests-_id_] with the `ID` from [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-analyticsReportRequests] to see if the report is still active and generating new reports.\n\n### Read the analytics reports\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-analyticsReportRequests-_id_-reports] to check whether your reports are available. This endpoint lists all the reports that the API generated to fulfill your request. For more about the information in each report see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/analytics-reports].\n\nEach report has a name and category attributes, like this:\n\nSome reports have two content levels, Standard or Detailed, which the report’s name reflects with a suffix. Standard reports include fields not easily related to uniquely identifiable user data. Detailed reports include all fields and also include additional privacy measures for the data, to help protect uniquely identifiable information for individuals.\n\nTo learn more about what data is in each report and report type, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/analytics-reports].\n\n### Download specific analytic report data\n\nSelect a report of interest and use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-analyticsReports-_id_-instances] to see a list of report instances filtered by `granularity` and `processingDate`. *Instances* are discreet containers for a report data set. You can choose a `granularity` of daily, weekly, or monthly for the reports in an instance. The `processingDate` represents new data available that day. The data for a given report with a specific `processingDate` might contain data for that day, full data for past dates, or both.\n\nThen, you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-analyticsReportInstances-_id_-segments] endpoint to get a download URL for the report. *Segments* are the actual report files, and based on the amount of data for a specific instance, you might have multiple segments to download. You can also use `sizeInBytes` and `checksum` to verify a specific report segment downloaded successfully.\n\n### Analyze your app data\n\nAfter you download some reports, you can start analyzing the data and learning more about how people use your apps. To learn more about the fields and descriptions in these reports see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/analytics-reports].\n\nFor `ONGOING` report requests you need to regularly use these APIs to get updated data for these reports.",
