For more information about webhook notifications, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/webhook-notifications].\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/accessibility-declarations] resources are now available to automate creating, updating, and reading accessibility declarations for your app per device family. You can also now use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/PATCH-v1-apps-_id_] to update the `accessibilityURL` for your app. For more information about accessibility declarations, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/configuring-accessibility-declarations].\n- Get TestFlight feedback screenshots and crash logs from beta testers for your apps. For more information about beta-tester feedback, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/beta-feedback-crash-submissions] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/beta-feedback-screenshot-submissions].\n- You can now read the customer review summary for your apps by using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-customerReviewSummarizations].\n- You can now manage background assets for your app that you can upload and download separately from the Apple hosted app. For more information about these assets, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/managing-apple-hosted-background-assets].\n- Activities for Game Center resources are now available; for more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/game-center-activities].\n- You can now setup and configure Game Center challenges. For more information on these challenges, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/game-center-challenges].\n\n### Improvements\n\n- XcodeMetrics now includes `recommendedMetricGoal`. Use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-perfPowerMetrics] to view the available recommendations for your app metrics.\n- There are new enums available for `mapAction` when creating or modifying an App Clip advanced experience. To learn more, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/AppClipAdvancedExperience\/Attributes-data.dictionary\/Place-data.dictionary].\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/uploading-assets-to-app-store-connect] now shows all media types that support upload to App Store Connect API.\n- The attribute `streamlinedPurchasingEnabled` has a default value of `true` for the object [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/App\/Attributes-data.dictionary].\n- The attribute `APPLE_VISION_PRO` is now documented for [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/Device\/Attributes-data.dictionary].\n\n### Deprecations\n\n- The attribute `challengeEnabled` is now deprecated from [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterDetails] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/PATCH-v1-gameCenterDetails-_id_]. Use `challenges` instead.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterLeaderboardSetMemberLocalizations] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/PATCH-v1-gameCenterLeaderboardSetMemberLocalizations-_id_] are deprecated.\n\n### Removals\n\n- Create an App Store version submission is now removed. Use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-reviewSubmissions] instead.\n- The `gamblingAndContests` and `seventeenPlus` properties are now removed from [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-appInfos-_id_-ageRatingDeclaration] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/PATCH-v1-ageRatingDeclarations-_id_]. Use the `contests` or `gambling` properties instead.\n\n## Versions\n\n- **App Store Connect API 4.1 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.8 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.7 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.6 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.5 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.4 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.3 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.2 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.1 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 3.0 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.4 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.3 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.2 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.1 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n- **App Store Connect API 2.0 release notes**: Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.\n\n",
