For more information see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-metrics-betaTesterUsages].\n- Game Center matchmaking rules help create better matches between players in multiplayer games using game-specific rules. You can configure your rules and test them with sample match requests and player properties. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/rules] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/testing].\n- Game Center matchmaking metrics diagnose performance and other issues with matchmaking. You can get match requests, queue information, results, errors, and more.
