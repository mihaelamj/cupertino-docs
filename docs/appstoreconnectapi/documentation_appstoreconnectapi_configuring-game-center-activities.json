  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse the activities API to create and configure ways to link players directly to content in your game. Once you create an activity you can link it to a challenge. To learn more about challenges, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/configuring-game-center-challenges].\n\nActivities provide a way to link players directly to your content. By describing your gameplay with activities, you can link the player to that part of your game when they engage with the activity. For example, when a player wants to complete your daily puzzle, you can send the player directly to that part of your game. To learn more about deep links, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/gamekit\/creating-activities-for-your-game#Add-universal-link-support].\n\nBefore you begin creating your activities, you need these items:\n\n### Create the activity\n\nBegin creating the activity by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterActivities] endpoint. Provide these attributes in your payload:\n\nAdditionally provide a relationship to a `gameCenterDetail` or a `gameCenterGroup`. If your leaderboard is in a Game Center group, use `gameCenterGroup`. If you’re relating this activity to a Game Center group, you need to use the `grp.` prefix.\n\nWhen you create an activity you use a payload like this:\n\nIn the response you get an `id` in the top-level data object. This `id` represents the Game Center activity. You can find this `id` at anytime using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-gameCenterDetails-_id_-gameCenterActivities] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-gameCenterGroups-_id_-gameCenterActivities] for a grouped app.\n\n### Create the activity version\n\nYou next need to create a version for your Game center activity. The version is the parent object for localizations, the `fallbackUrl` and the activity image. Create the activity version using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterActivityVersions]. The `fallbackUrl` is what the system uses to support operating systems before iOS 26, macOS 26, and tvOS 26, to direct a player to an invitation page on the web. To learn more about deep links and `fallbackUrl`, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/gamekit\/creating-activities-for-your-game#Add-universal-link-support].\n\n### Add an activity version localization\n\nYou next add an activity version localization by using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterActivityLocalizations]. The `locale` and `name` attributes are required. The `name` represent the label shown for the activity inside the Games app. For a list of possible `locale` values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/managing-metadata-in-your-app-by-using-locale-shortcodes]. The `description` attribute is optional but can help a player better understand the activity. The localization requires a relationship to its parent activity version. At minimum, one activity version localization is required for submission to review.\n\nUse a payload like this:\n\n### Add the activity version image\n\nAdding a default activity image is very similar to adding an app store screenshot or app review image. You can associate the activity version default image with an activity version or an activity localization. When you create a new activity version, the default image is inherited. At minimum, a default image is required for submission to review.\n\nStart by using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterActivityImages] with a payload that looks like this:\n\nThe response includes one or more `PUT` requests; use these URL’s to upload your image.\n\nAfter uploading, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/PATCH-v1-gameCenterActivityImages-_id_] to commit your image to the related resource with a payload like this:\n\nTo learn more uploading images, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/uploading-assets-to-app-store-connect].\n\n### Relate your activity to a leaderboard\n\nIf your activity is not a multiplayer activity, it must be have a relationship to a leaderboard. If you don’t have an existing or appropriate leaderboard for your activity, you can create one using [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterLeaderboards]. A multiplayer activity, using the `supportsPartyCode` attribute, can be used as a lobby for a group game session.  When you’re ready to relate your activity to your leaderboard, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/PATCH-v1-gameCenterLeaderboards-_id_-relationships-activity] with the Game Center leaderboard `id` in the request URL and with a payload like this:\n\n### Submit your activity version for review\n\nNow, you’re ready to submit your activity version for review. Use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterActivityVersionReleases] to attach your activity version to a `gameCenterDetail`. To find the `gameCenterDetail` id, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-gameCenterDetail]. Then, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-reviewSubmissions] to send the `appStoreVersion`, and your associated activity version to app review.\n\nUse a payload like this:",
