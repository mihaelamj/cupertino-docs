This webhook endpoint receives `HTTP POST` requests from App Store Connect. The `POST` requests describe important events about your app. Use the webhooks notifications endpoint to configure the notifications for events happening to your apps.\n\nTo invoke your webhook, App Store Connect needs to know your server’s webhook endpoint URL.
