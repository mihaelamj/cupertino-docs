  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nCreating and managing default and advanced App Clip experiences using the [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/] website are key tasks when creating an App Clip. However, your App Clip may require many App Clip experiences. For example, your App Clip could allow users to order food at a chain restaurant with hundreds of locations. Each location would need its own advanced App Clip experience to display a photo of the location on the App Clip card. To reduce the effort of managing hundreds or even thousands of App Clip experiences, use the App Store Connect API to automatically access App Clip information and automate the creation and management of:\n\nIf you’re new to creating an App Clip, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppClip] and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/app-clips\/overview\/introduction\/]. For more information about creating App Clip experiences, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppClip\/configuring-the-launch-experience-of-your-app-clip].\n\n### Review App Store Connect API Usage\n\nTo read App Clip information and manage App Clip experiences with the App Store Connect API, you need to understand key concepts for using the API. If you’re new to using the App Store Connect API, make sure to read the documentation in the Essentials section of [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI] and learn how to create API keys, generate JWTs, identify rate limits, and more.\n\nTo read App Clip information and manage App Clip experiences, be sure you have one of the following user roles:\n\nFor the full list of App Store Connect user roles, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/UserRole].\n\n### Plan App Clip Experience Creation and Management\n\nCreating or managing App Clip experiences typically requires a sequence of calls to endpoints the App Store Connect API provides. Before you start working on the implementation, list the steps required to achieve your goal. While the exact API calls you need to make depend on your use case, creating an App Clip experience usually involves:\n\n### Gather Required Information\n\nBefore you can create or update an App Clip experience using the App Store Connect API, you likely need to gather additional information. To find out what information you need:\n\n### Upload the Image Asset that Appears on the App Clip Card\n\nApp Clip experience functionality provided by the App Store Connect API often involves uploading image assets to App Store Connect. For example, creating an App Clip experience using the App Store Connect API requires an image asset that appears on the App Clip card.\n\nUploading an image asset for an App Clip experience works similarly to uploading other assets to App Store Connect:\n\nFor additional information on uploading assets to App Store Connect, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/uploading-assets-to-app-store-connect].\n\n### Create an App Clip Experience\n\nCreating default and advanced App Clip experiences is a key functionality that App Store Connect provides. When you’ve gathered all required information and uploaded the image that appears on the App Clip card, you’re ready to create an App Clip experience.\n\nTo create a default App Clip experience:\n\nTo create an advanced App Clip experience:\n\nTo create an advanced App Clip experience that appears in Apple Maps, you create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/AppClipAdvancedExperienceCreateRequest\/Data-data.dictionary\/Attributes-data.dictionary\/Place-data.dictionary] association that connects the App Clip experience to a physical location. Apple Maps uses any location data that you provide solely for matching an App Clip experience to an existing location. If it can’t find a match, Apple Maps doesn’t use the provided location data.\n\n### Update and Delete App Clip Experiences\n\nSimilar to how App Store Connect provides functionality to create App Clip experiences, it also offers functionality to update App Clip experiences. For example, you may need to update the phone number of an advanced App Clip experience, or change the localized subtitle that appears on the App Clip card of a default App Clip experience. However, you can’t update existing App Clip experiences for an already released App Clip. To update an already released App Clip, create a new App Clip experience and attach it to a new version of your app. When the new version passes App Review and you publish it on the App Store, it uses the new App Clip experience.\n\nSimilarly, you can’t delete App Clip experiences for an already released app version unless you release a new version of your app without an App Clip. That said, you can use functionality provided by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/default-app-clip-experiences] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/advanced-app-clip-experiences] resources to update or delete App Clip experiences that aren’t attached to a released App Clip:\n\n### Manage Beta App Clip Experiences\n\nVerifying that the launch experience of the App Clip is free of errors is a key task when developing an App Clip. When you distribute your full app with TestFlight, you can configure beta App Clip experiences that testers use to launch your App Clip with the TestFlight app. To help automate creating and updating beta App Clip experiences, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/beta-app-clip-invocations] resource. It provides functionality to create, read, update, and delete a beta App Clip experience. For example, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-betaAppClipInvocations] endpoint to create a beta App Clip experience.",

Creating the App Clip experience\n\n### Gather Required Information\n\nBefore you can create or update an App Clip experience using the App Store Connect API, you likely need to gather additional information. To find out what information you need:\n\n1. Identify the endpoint you need to call. For example, you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-appClipDefaultExperiences] endpoint to create a default App Clip experience.\n2. Review attributes and relationships of the request you send to the endpoint and other involved objects. For example, successfully creating a default App Clip experience requires [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/app-clips], [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/app-store-versions], [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/app-clip-app-store-review-details], [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/app-clip-header-images], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/default-app-clip-experience-localizations] information.\n\n### Upload the Image Asset that Appears on the App Clip Card\n\nApp Clip experience functionality provided by the App Store Connect API often involves uploading image assets to App Store Connect. For example, creating an App Clip experience using the App Store Connect API requires an image asset that appears on the App Clip card.\n\nUploading an image asset for an App Clip experience works similarly to uploading other assets to App Store Connect:\n\n1. Reserve the image asset using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-appClipHeaderImages] endpoint for a default App Clip experience or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-appClipAdvancedExperienceImages] endpoint for an advanced App Clip experience.\n2. Upload the image asset using the upload operations provided in the response to your reservation request.\n3. Commit the image asset using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/PATCH-v1-appClipHeaderImages-_id_] endpoint for a default App Clip experience and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/PATCH-v1-appClipAdvancedExperienceImages-_id_] endpoint for an advanced App Clip experience.\n4. Fetch information about the image asset to verify that the upload succeeded using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-appClipHeaderImages-_id_] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-appClipAdvancedExperienceImages-_id_] endpoints.\n\nFor additional information on uploading assets to App Store Connect, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/uploading-assets-to-app-store-connect].\n\n### Create an App Clip Experience\n\nCreating default and advanced App Clip experiences is a key functionality that App Store Connect provides.

Be sure to attach the default App Clip experience to an App Store version by including the related [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/app-store-versions] resource in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/AppClipDefaultExperienceCreateRequest]. Alternatively, update an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/app-store-versions] resource to include the new default App Clip experience.\n- Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-appClipAppStoreReviewDetails] endpoint to provide the default App Clip experience’s invocation URL to App Review.\n- Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-appClipDefaultExperienceLocalizations] endpoint to provide a localized subtitle and an image that appears on the App Clip card.\n\n\n\nTo create an advanced App Clip experience:\n\n- Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-appClipAdvancedExperiences] endpoint.\n- Include the related [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/app-clips], [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/AppClipAdvancedExperienceLocalization], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/advanced-app-clip-experience-images] resources.\n\n\n\nTo create an advanced App Clip experience that appears in Apple Maps, you create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/AppClipAdvancedExperienceCreateRequest\/Data-data.dictionary\/Attributes-data.dictionary\/Place-data.dictionary] association that connects the App Clip experience to a physical location.
