Customers can opt-in to share this information with you on their devices.\n\nA *metric* is a measurement of the power and performance impact of an app running on a device. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/MetricCategory] type lists the categories of measurements the system makes; for example, the `LAUNCH` metric measures how long it takes an app to present its first frame.

Insights compare the performance of the most recent app version with previous versions. Look for insights in the response body object, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/xcodeMetrics].\n\nA *diagnostic signature* is a recurring pattern of function calls your app makes that are associated with a metric.
