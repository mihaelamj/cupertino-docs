  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nJSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard ([https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519]) that defines a way to securely transmit information. The App Store Connect API requires JWTs to authorize each API request. You create the token, and sign it with the private key you downloaded from App Store Connect.\n\nTo generate a signed JWT:\n\nInclude the signed JWT in the authorization header of each App Store Connect API request.\n\n### Create the JWT Header\n\nTo create a JWT to communicate with the App Store Connect API, use the following fields and values in the header:\n\nTo get your key ID for your team API key from App Store Connect, log in to [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/] and:\n\nThe key IDs appear in a column under the Active heading.\n\nTo get your key ID for your individual API key from App Store Connect, log in to [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/] and:\n\nHere’s an example of a JWT header:\n\n### Create the JWT Payload for Team Keys\n\nThe JWT payload contains information specific to the App Store Connect APIs, such as issuer ID and expiration time. Use the following fields and values in the JWT payload:\n\nTo get your issuer ID, log in to [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/] and:\n\nThe issuer ID appears near the top of the page. To copy the issuer ID, click Copy next to the ID.\n\nHere’s an example of a JWT payload:\n\n### Create the JWT Payload for Individual Keys\n\nThe JWT payload for Individual keys contains information specific to the App Store Connect APIs, and expiration time. Use the following fields and values in the JWT payload:\n\nHere’s an example of a JWT payload:\n\n### Determine the Scope of the Token\n\nTo reduce potential attack surface and improve security of your tokens, you can explicitly specify the scope of a token. The scope tells App Store Connect which requests it needs to accept for the token. If you unintentionally share a token with an unauthorized party, a limited scope reduces the requests that a potential attacker can make using the token.\n\nThe scope claim is an array of strings, each representing a request. Each scope entry includes:\n\nApp Store Connect rejects a token with a scope claim if none of the scope entries match the attempted request.\n\nThe following code listing shows an example of a JWT payload with a scope.\n\nWith this payload, App Store Connect only allows you to fetch a list of iOS apps using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps] endpoint if you use the `filter[platform]=IOS` query parameter.\n\nYou can use a JWT without a `scope` for any request as long as the role of the API key allows it.\n\n### Determine the Appropriate Token Lifetime\n\nFor every request, App Store Connect calculates the valid time for a token, referred as the token’s `lifetime`, by subtracting the `iat` claim from the `exp` claim. For increased security, carefully consider the lifetime of tokens you create and choose a lifetime that doesn’t allow usage of the token for longer than necessary. For example, an appropriate lifetime for a token you use for a one-off request is two minutes. In contrast, consider using a token with a lifetime of 20 minutes for a long-running process that makes many requests with the same token. Additionally, consider generating a new token periodically throughout the process, instead of issuing tokens with longer lifetimes.\n\nFor most requests, App Store Connect rejects a token with a lifetime greater than 20 minutes. However, it accepts long-lived tokens for some inherently safe requests if:\n\nIf a token meets all the above criteria, App Store Connect accepts a token with a lifetime of up to six months for the following resources:\n\n### Sign the JWT\n\nUse the private key associated with the key ID you specified in the header to sign the token.\n\nRegardless of the programming language you’re using with the App Store Connect API, there are a variety of open source libraries available online for creating and signing JWT tokens. See [https:\/\/jwt.io\/] for more information.\n\n### Include the JWT in the Request’s Authorization Header\n\nOnce you have a complete and signed token, provide the token in the request’s authorization header as a bearer token.\n\nThe following example shows a `curl` command using a bearer token. Replace the text `[signed token]` with the value of the signed token itself.",
