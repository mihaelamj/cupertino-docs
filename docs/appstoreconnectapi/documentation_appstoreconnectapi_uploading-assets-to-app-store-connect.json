  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhile managing your App Store apps, you may need to upload various assets or files to App Store Connect. These assets may include screenshots, app previews, attachments for App Review, and routing app coverage files. The uploading APIs are designed to ensure reliability for large files, even over an unreliable connection. The API instructs you to divide individual large asset files into multiple upload requests. When you tell the API you’ve finished uploading, App Store Connect begins processing your files.\n\nThere are four steps to upload an asset:\n\nThis workflow is the same for every asset type you manage and upload using the following API resources:\n\n### Make an Asset Reservation\n\nThe first step to upload an asset is making an asset reservation. You send a request that specifies the type of asset you’ll be uploading, its filename, and size in bytes. A successful response provides a set of operations you will use to upload the asset. If your asset is large, you may receive multiple operations in the response that ask you to divide the asset into parts for uploading.\n\nFor example, to make a reservation to upload an app screenshot called “my_screenshot.png” with a file size of 11097 bytes, the request is:\n\nA successful response includes these fields to note:\n\nThe full response is:\n\nNote the upload operations. In this example, the file can be uploaded in a single operation:\n\nAfter you make a successful reservation, your asset moves into the `AWAITING_UPLOAD` state, which you can see in the response.\n\nIf your reservation request fails, the API returns an error code ([doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/ErrorResponse]). For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/interpreting-and-handling-errors].\n\n### Upload the Asset\n\nThe next step in delivering an asset to App Store Connect is uploading the binary data that is the asset or file. Use the upload operations returned in the response to your reservation request to upload your asset to App Store Connect.\n\nIf your asset is large enough, you will receive multiple upload operations, each specifying the length in bytes and the byte offset into the file. Divide the large asset into binary data parts as specified by those instructions. One option, using the `length` 11097, is:\n\nThe resulting split files are have a sequential naming convention, you need to upload all splits of the original file. The system will combine the splits into one image.\n\nNext you:\n\nThe provided upload URLs are unauthenticated and time-limited. You don’t need to supply a JWT; don’t share the URLs.\n\nYou can upload parts of your asset concurrently and in any order to improve performance. If one part doesn’t upload correctly, you can resend it at any time before you commit the asset. See `Resolve upload failures caused by lost connections including power outages` for more information.\n\nThe asset state remains as `AWAITING_UPLOAD` while you upload the parts that make up your file.\n\n### Commit the Reservation\n\nAfter you’ve uploaded all parts of your asset to App Store Connect, you must commit the reservation. The commit tells App Store Connect that you’ve finished uploading and the asset is ready to be processed.\n\nTo commit the reservation, provide the following attributes in the PATCH request:\n\nApp Store Connect compares the bytes received with the total bytes you described for your asset in the asset reservation request (`fileSize`). If the total bytes received don’t match the file size value in the reservation, the commit request fails.\n\nA successful commit request changes the asset state to `UPLOAD_COMPLETE`.\n\n### Verify the Upload Succeeded\n\nAfter receiving your commit request, App Store Connect validates and processes the uploaded asset. Processing is asynchronous and can take from a few seconds up to a few minutes, depending on the size and complexity of the asset. Your asset remains in the `UPLOAD_COMPLETE` state until App Store Connect finishes processing it. Use the API to re-fetch the asset at any time to check on its status.\n\nIf your asset processes successfully, the system changes the asset’s state to `COMPLETE`. This is the final state for a successful asset upload.\n\nIf your asset’s processing fails, the system changes the asset’s state to `FAILED`. `FAILED` is a terminal state. To upload your asset you must delete the asset record and retry your upload, beginning with making an asset reservation.\n\n### Validate Your Upload\n\nApp Store Connect validates uploads by confirming that the checksum of the final asset received matches the `sourceFileChecksum` you specified in your commit request. App Store Connect also checks other criteria, like file formats and screenshot dimensions.\n\nYou can further validate your uploads by viewing your app’s metadata in App Store Connect or by using the API to download the final processed asset for review.\n\n### Resolve Upload Failures\n\nYou may encounter errors at any stage of the upload process: during the upload due to power outages or an expired reservations, or after you’ve uploaded the asset if the App Store Connect processing fails.\n\nIf you experience a lost connection while uploading an asset or a part of an asset, you can retry the upload for just the failed parts using the upload operations. You can continue uploading the asset parts, as needed, until you commit the reservation.\n\nIf an asset reservations expires, attempting an upload or commit returns an error. You have a limited window of time to finish your upload after you have created an asset reservation. In general, plan to finish an upload within a week of creating the asset reservation. If the time window expires before you finish uploading and committing the asset, delete the asset reservation and begin again, starting with requesting a new asset reservation. The exact expiration time for each upload operation is found in the `Expires` parameter in the upload URL. This value is a Unix timestamp, in UTC.\n\nIf your asset fails processing at App Store Connect, the asset state will change to `FAILED`. `FAILED` is a terminal state. Review the error messaging provided by the API so you can identify and resolve the issue. Then delete the asset record and retry your upload,  beginning by making an asset reservation.",
