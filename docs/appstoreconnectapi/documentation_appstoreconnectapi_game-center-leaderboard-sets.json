For example, in a game that includes many levels, you might define a leaderboard set to organize the leaderboards for each level. A single app can have 100 leaderboard sets, and a set can have a maximum of 100 leaderboards. You must have at least one leaderboard for your app before you can create a leaderboard set. Once you add leaderboard sets to your app, all future leaderboards that you configure for the app must be included in a leaderboard set.\n\nThe process to start using leaderboard sets to organize your app’s leaderboards includes these steps:\n\nFor more information about how to use Leaderboard sets in your app, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/configure-game-center\/configure-leaderboard-sets].",
