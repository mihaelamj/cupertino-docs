  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse alternative distribution keys to establish an alternative marketplace. To create an alternative distribution key, you must have an existing alternative marketplace app in App Store Connect. If a marketplace app doesn’t already exist, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/distributing-apps-in-the-european-union\/create-an-marketplace-app] before continuing.\n\nAfter you create these keys, generate JSON web tokens (JWTs) to connect your marketplace to the apps it distributes. Unlike the auth tokens referenced in [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/generating-tokens-for-api-requests], this JWT — the marketplace token — is specifically created by your marketplace and shared with the app developer to upload to App Store Connect.\n\n### Generate your private key\n\nApp Store Connect uses a private cryptographic key to generate a signature for each app that your alternative marketplace distributes. During registration, marketplace apps create a public-private key pair, and send the public key to App Store Connect. The private key you create uses an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm.\n\nTo create your private key, open Terminal and enter the following command:\n\nThis command creates the file `private_key.pem`, which contains your private key.\n\n### Generate your public key\n\nNext, you create a public key from the private key you created in the previous section. The public key is a PEM-encoded PKCS#8 EC key that uses the P-256 curve. In Terminal, enter the following command:\n\nThis command creates the file `public_key.pem`, which contains your public key. Run this command any time to generate a copy of your public key file. To request your existing public key from App Store Connect, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps-_id_-alternativeDistributionKey].\n\n### Create an alternative distribution key\n\nNext, upload your public key to App Store Connect using the endpoint described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-alternativeDistributionKeys].\n\nAn alternative distribution key applies to all apps in your account. You can optionally make an application-specific alternative distirbution key by adding the app Apple ID for your marketplace app in the `relationships` object in the JSON payload when calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-alternativeDistributionKeys]. You can find this app Apple ID by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/GET-v1-apps] and filtering for your app name or by going to App Store Connect. This relationship is optional. If you don’t include a relationship to an app Apple ID, the alternative distribution key is associated with all alternative distubution apps on your account.\n\nTo access your marketplace app’s app Apple ID, log in to [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/].\n\nThe following request uploads the public key to App Store Connect:\n\n### Obtain Developer ID\n\nWhen developers request to distribute their app on your marketplace, you give them a JWT that’s signed with the private key you created earlier. They upload the JWT to App Store Connect, which uses your public key to verify that the token signature is authentic and creates the relationship to your app marketplace.\n\nAsk the app developer for their Developer ID, to learn more, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/distributing-apps-in-the-european-union\/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace].\n\n### Create the JSON web token\n\nGenerate the marketplace token after creating the alternative distribution key and receiving the Developer ID from the app developer. To generate a signed JWT:\n\nTo create a JWT for the app developer to upload to App Store Connect, use the information in the following table to fill in the header details:\n\nThe JWT payload contains information specific to the App Store Connect APIs, such as the issuer, issued at, expiration time, audience, principal developer identifier, and nonce. Use the information in the following table to fill in the payload claims:\n\n### Sign the token and share it with the app developer\n\nAfter creating the JWT, sign it with the private key you created earlier using ECDSA with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm. A decoded token has the following format:\n\nThere are a variety of open-source libraries in various programming language for creating and signing JWTs. For more information, see [https:\/\/JWT.io].\n\nAfter you sign the JWT, provide the token to the app developer so they can upload it to App Store Connect, which uses your public key to verify that the token signature is authentic and creates the relationship to your app marketplace. While uploading the JWT, the app developer selects the apps they want to associate with your marketplace. To learn how an app developer can associate their apps with your marketplace and upload your JWT, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/distributing-apps-in-the-european-union\/manage-distribution-on-an-alternative-app-marketplace].",
