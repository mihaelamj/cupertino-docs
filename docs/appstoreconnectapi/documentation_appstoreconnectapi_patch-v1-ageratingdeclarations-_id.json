Use this endpoint to edit the declaration and provide app-characteristic information so App Store Connect can determine the appropriate age rating for the app.\n\nUse this endpoint to indicate whether an app is Made for Kids.\n\nWhen calling this endpoint, only include the attributes that you’re modifying.\n\nThe attributes for age-rating declarations, `INFREQUENT_OR_MILD` and `FREQUENT_OR_INTENSE` are deprecated. Instead, use `INFREQUENT` or `FREQUENT`.\n\nFor example, in an app that has a `FREQUENT` declaration for contests, the age rating for the `AppInfos` is 12+. If you declare a value of true for `gambling`, the age rating for the `AppInfos` is 17+.\n\n### Modify an Age Rating Declaration\n\n### Mark an App as Made for Kids",
