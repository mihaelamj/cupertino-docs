The limits apply to requests you send using the same API key.\n\n### Identify Limits Provided in the HTTP Header\n\nThe API presents rate limits to users in an HTTP header. Every response from the API includes an `X-Rate-Limit` HTTP header. Its value has the form:\n\n```other\nuser-hour-lim:3500;user-hour-rem:500;\n```\n\nThe header info includes:\n\n- `user-hour-lim`, which indicates the number of requests you can make per hour with the same API key.\n- `user-hour-rem`, which shows the number of requests remaining.\n\nIn this example, you are limited to 3500 requests per hour, with 500 remaining. Actual limits can vary.\n\nThe time frame is a “rolling hour.” At any moment, the `user-hour-rem` value is your per-hour limit, minus the total requests you’ve made in the previous 60 minutes.\n\n### Interpret the Error Response\n\nIf you exceed a per-hour limit, the API rejects requests with an HTTP 429 response, with the `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` error code. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreconnectapi\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/about-the-http-status-code] for more information.\n\n### Handle Exceeded Limits Gracefully\n\nConsider rate limits as you integrate the API:\n\n- If you periodically call the API to check a value, throttle your requests to avoid exceeding the per-hour limit for that endpoint.\n- Manage the HTTP 429 `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` error in your error-handling process. For example, log the failure and queue the job to be processed again at a later time.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Creating API Keys for App Store Connect API**: Create API keys to sign JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and authorize API requests.\n- **Generating Tokens for API Requests**: Create JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) signed with your private key to authorize API requests.\n- **Revoking API Keys**: Revoke unused, lost, or compromised private keys.\n- **Uploading Assets to App Store Connect**: Upload screenshots, app previews, attachments for App Review, and routing app coverage files to App Store Connect.\n- **App Store Connect API Release Notes**: Learn about new features and updates in the App Store Connect API.\n\n",
