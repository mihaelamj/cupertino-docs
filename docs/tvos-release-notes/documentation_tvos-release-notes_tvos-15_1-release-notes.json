Additionally, casting string class names into Class objects with `NSConstantValueExpression` is deprecated. (84017178)\n\n**Workaround:** Pass temporary objects to `NSExpression` in the context parameter of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSExpression\/expressionValue(with:context:)], or with `NSPredicate` as the `substitutionVariables` parameter of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSPredicate\/evaluate(with:substitutionVariables:)]. You can create a derived predicate with all the substitution variables replaced (bound), using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSPredicate\/withSubstitutionVariables(_:)] on an existing `NSPredicate` so that code using the object can continue to use a simple `evaluate(with object: Any?)` invocation.\n\n## tvOS 15\n\n- **tvOS 15.6 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **tvOS 15.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **tvOS 15.4 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **tvOS 15.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **tvOS 15.2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **tvOS 15 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
