The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.3, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.3, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-14_3-release-notes].\n\n### Home\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Both manual and automatic Software Update support is now available for Matter Accessories. (102727759)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `ScrollView` has improved support for right to left languages by default. If you have a `ScrollView` that shouldn’t change its behavior in right to left languages, use the `.environment(\\.layoutDirection, .leftToRight)` modifier to ensure the `ScrollView` always sees a left to right layout direction. (65108729)\n- Fixed: Search scopes are now supported on tvOS. (84039097)\n- Fixed: Presentations in SwiftUI using the ‘sheet’ or ‘fullScreenCover’ modifier can now be dynamically presented again while a dismiss animation is in progress. Previously, attempting to present again in this case would do nothing.\n\nNote: A data race in app code that was previously ignored might cause a sheet to be presented again with this change. If this happens, check that your state isn’t triggering a new presentation.
