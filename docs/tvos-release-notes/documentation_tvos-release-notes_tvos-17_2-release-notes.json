The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 15.1, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 15.1, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-15_1-release-notes].\n\n### Apple Music\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The Favorite Songs playlist might take a while to appear on some iOS\/iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS devices.  (117219873)\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- New pricing properties `price`, `currency`, and `currencyCode` are now available on [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/storekit\/transaction]. If an offer was applied to the transaction, a new property `offer` is available to see information about it (id, type, payment mode), as well as convenience properties `offerID`, `offerType`, and `offerPaymentMode`.  (106650768)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The StoreKit 2 Transaction properties `price`, `currency`, and `Offer.paymentMode` now have Optional types.  (116592563)\n- Fixed: The StoreKit 2 Transaction properties `price`, `currency`, and `Offer.paymentMode` now have Optional types.  (116809380)\n- Fixed an issue causing the refund request “Done” button to not dismiss the sheet when using StoreKit Testing in Xcode.  (117482750)\n- Fixed an issue where StoreKit 2 `deviceVerification` was incorrect, which caused transaction verification to fail.  (117689523) (FB13315344)\n\n### Swift Charts\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue where a scrollable chart did not respect the initial non-zero binding value passed to `chartScrollPosition`.  (114889276)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Use `_logChanges()` to log causes of SwiftUI view updates.\n\nCall the new debugging method `_logChanges()` in the body of a SwiftUI view to log information about why the system is updating the view. For example:\n\n```swift\n     struct MyView: View {\n         var body: some View {\n             #if DEBUG\n             let _ = Self._logChanges()\n             #endif\n             \/\/ … rest of view body …\n         }\n     }\n```\n\nAs well as the physical property names, “@self” marks that the view value itself has changed, and “@identity” marks that the identity of the view has changed (that is, that the persistent data associated with the view has been recycled for a new instance of the same type).\n\nThe new `_logChanges()` method is like the existing `_printChanges()` one, except that the new method uses the system console, which is useful in some debugging workflows.\n\nCalls to `_logChanges()` log at the info level to the “com.apple.SwiftUI” subsystem with the category “Changed Body Properties”.  (113352555)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Resolved a possible Swift access conflict crash that could occur with toolbar items.  (113992797)\n- Fixed: To prevent unintentional implicit dependency cycles, ImageRenderer no longer sends Observable updates when the image it produces changes. This change **does not** affect the behavior when a dependency is explicitly declared by observing the ImageRenderer’s publisher.
