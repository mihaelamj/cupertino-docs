MapKit never allows navigation on the Look Around preview itself.\n- **showsRoadLabels**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the Look Around scene shows road labels after the user taps the Look Around preview to enter the full screen Look Around viewer. MapKit never shows road labels on the Look Around preview itself.\n- **pointsOfInterest**: The categories of points of interest to display after the user taps the Look Around preview to enter the full screen Look Around viewer. MapKit never displays points of interest on the Look Around preview itself. By default, MapKit displays all points of interest categories.\n- **badgePosition**: A value that controls the position of a badge on the Look Around preview.\n\n## Discussion\n\nNavigation refers to the ability to tap-to-navigate to a different vantage point in the Look Around scene and what a person can control through the use of the `allowsNavigation` property.
