Maps capability allows an app to provide specific directions beyond what the Maps app supports, including subway routes, hiking trails, and bike paths. Use Xcode to enable Maps capability and select the supported modes.\n\n### Add Maps Capability to Your Project\n\nThe screenshot below shows the Maps capability:\n\n\n\nFor more information on enabling capabilities in your app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app].
