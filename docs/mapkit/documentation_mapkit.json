You can use the MapKit framework to:\n\n- Embed maps directly into your app’s windows and views.\n- Add annotations and overlays to a map to call out points of interest.\n- Add LookAround capabilities to enable users to explore locations at street level.\n- Respond to user interactions with well known points of interest, geographical features, and boundaries.\n- Provide text completion to make it easy for users to search for a destination or point of interest.\n\n## The MapKit APIs\n\n- **MapKit for AppKit and UIKit**\n- **MapKit for SwiftUI**: MapKit for SwiftUI allows you to build map-centric views and apps across Apple platforms. You can design expressive and highly interactive Maps with minimal code by composing views, using ViewBuilders and view modifiers.\n- **Adopting unified Maps URLs**: Access Maps URLs and options for displaying Maps information across Apple platforms.\n\n## Articles\n\n- **Deprecated Symbols**: MapKit classes, protocols, and entitlements that are no longer supported.\n- **Preparing your app to be the default navigation app**: Configure your navigation app so people can set it as the default on their devices.\n\n## Structures\n\n- **AnyMapContent**: A type-erased map content.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Location and Maps Programming Guide**\n- **MapKit JS**: Embed interactive Apple Maps on your website, annotate points of interest, and perform georelated searches.\n- **Apple Maps Server API**: Reduce API calls and conserve device power by streamlining your app’s georelated searches.\n\n",
