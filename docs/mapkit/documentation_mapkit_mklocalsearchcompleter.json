You must always assign a delegate object to the search completer so that you can receive the search results that it generates. Specify a search region to restrict results to a designated area. The following code shows a simple example of a view controller that stores the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mapkit\/documentation\/MapKit\/MKLocalSearchCompleter] object in a property. The view controller itself acts as the delegate for the completer and the view controller uses the region associated with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.mapkit\/documentation\/MapKit\/MKMapView] object that’s part of the view controller’s interface.
