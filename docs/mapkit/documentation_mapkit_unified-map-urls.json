  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIn iOS 18.4 and later, macOS 15.4 and later, and watchOS 11.4 and later, the Maps platform provides a new, unified collection of URLs that offers the same functionality on all devices. Use the Maps path components to control aspects of the Maps display, ranging from the presentation of a simple map centered on a location you provide, to finding specific points of interest (POIs) and providing complex multistop driving, walking, or transit directions.\n\n## Frame the map display\n\nUse the `\/frame` path component and `query` parameters to control aspects of the map’s framing and representation. This component allows you to set a map’s orientation, style, visible area (the map’s span), and other perspective controls, as described in the table below.\n\nThe following  `\/frame` path component examples demonstrate different kinds of map framing, along with details, where necessary, on how specific parameters affect what the map displays.\n\n## Perform general searches\n\nYou can use the `\/search` path component to search for specific kinds of locations using several `query` parameters.\n\nThe following  `\/search`  path component examples demonstrate how to use the `search` path component to find `pizza`, one of Maps’ POI identifiers, using different kinds of location and distance descriptions.\n\n## Show the place card of a POI\n\nUsing the `\/place` path component enables you to specify a place card that shows useful details about points of interest on the map. Use the parameters in the following table to specify a POI and optionally the place card name and map type.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate different place card details along with details, where necessary, on how specific parameters affect what the maps displays.\n\n## Explore the environment using Look Around\n\nUse the `\/look-around` path component and one of the following parameters to specify the initial location to start a session using Look Around.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate Look Around experiences in different cities:\n\n## Request directions\n\nUse the `\/directions` path component and following query parameters in several combinations to request directions.\n\nYou can use the query parameters to the `directions` path in a large number of combinations to control how Maps displays directions. Limitations on the combinators or side effect that they may have are listed in the table above.\n\n## Find guides and curated places\n\nUsing the `\/guides` path component, you can ask Maps to provide details about place guides and curated collections using the following URL: [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/guides].\n\n## Report a problem\n\nIf you find an issue with Apple Maps, you can report a problem using the `\/report-a-problem path` component, followed by any of the following parameters:\n\n### Example problem reports\n\nYou can report a problem using the same kinds of location descriptors the other queries use. The following examples show how to report a problem using a coordinate, an address, or a Place ID.\n\nWhen you open the `report-a-problem` URL, Maps opens a problem report sheet to ask a person for more detail on the nature of the problem, which Apple uses to investigate the report.\n\n## Retrieve a full Maps URL from a shortened URL\n\nWhen people share a map URL from Maps, this system creates a shortened version that’s more efficient to send in the app, for example, Messages or Mail. If you need to recover the full URL, follow these steps:",

Use the Maps path components to control aspects of the Maps display, ranging from the presentation of a simple map centered on a location you provide, to finding specific points of interest (POIs) and providing complex multistop driving, walking, or transit directions.\n\n## Frame the map display\n\nUse the `\/frame` path component and `query` parameters to control aspects of the map’s framing and representation. This component allows you to set a map’s orientation, style, visible area (the map’s span), and other perspective controls, as described in the table below.\n\n\n\nThe following  `\/frame` path component examples demonstrate different kinds of map framing, along with details, where necessary, on how specific parameters affect what the map displays.\n\n- Center the map at specific coordinate — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?center=40.753035,-73.981846].\n- Set map mode to transit and center map at specific coordinate — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?map=transit&center=40.753035,-73.981846].\n- Set the map mode to `explore` and set user tracking to `follow` —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?coordinate=40.753035,-73.981846&map=explore&mode=follow&span=0.024461,0.043938].\n- Set map mode to `explore`; this setting cause the map to focus on a specified coordinate, and sets the map camera attributes — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?map=explore&center=40.753035,-73.981846&heading=180&pitch=15&distance=10000].\n- Set the map mode to `explore`, and set location tracking mode to `follow` — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?map=explore&center=40.753035,-73.981846&heading=18a0&pitch=15&distance=10000&mode=follow]. If you’re setting tracking mode and camera properties, the tracking mode takes precedence. Setting camera properties requires a center coordinate.\n- Center the map at a specific coordinate and frame the map to the specified span —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?center=40.753035,-73.981846&span=0.05,0.05]. It’s also possible to frame the map using the `distance` parameter, for example, [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?center=40.753035,-73.981846&distance=17825].\n- Set the map mode to `explore`, which centers the map at a specified coordinate, and sets the map camera elevation, heading, and angle; in this example, facing East (90˚), a distance of 1 km, and a map pitch of 15˚ — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?map=explore&center=37.316115,-122.050910&heading=90&pitch=15&distance=10000].\n- Center the map at a specific coordinate and set the camera `distance` — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?map=explore&center=40.753035,-73.981846&distance=10000].\n- Center the map at a specific coordinate and set the camera to the specified properties —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/frame?center=37.797198,-122.407377&distance=5000&pitch=15&heading=180&span=1.0,1.0]. If you provide both the `span` and `camera` properties, the `camera` properties take precedence, since they’re more specific than a `span`.\n\n## Perform general searches\n\nYou can use the `\/search` path component to search for specific kinds of locations using several `query` parameters.\n\n\n\nThe following  `\/search`  path component examples demonstrate how to use the `search` path component to find `pizza`, one of Maps’ POI identifiers, using different kinds of location and distance descriptions.\n\n- Show results for `pizza` around a person’s location: [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/search?query=pizza]. The default center point is a person’s location.\n- Show results for `pizza` centered on Trafalgar Square in London, United Kingdom — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/search?query=pizza&center=51.507984,-0.128015].\n- Show results for `pizza` within approximately 1 km around Washington Square Park in New York City —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/search?query=pizza&center=40.730877,-73.997603&span=0.05,0.05].\n\n## Show the place card of a POI\n\nUsing the `\/place` path component enables you to specify a place card that shows useful details about points of interest on the map. Use the parameters in the following table to specify a POI and optionally the place card name and map type.\n\n\n\nThe following examples demonstrate different place card details along with details, where necessary, on how specific parameters affect what the maps displays.\n\n- Show the address 1000 Fifth Ave, NY, NY, which is located at the specified coordinate and associated POIs near this address —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/place?coordinate=40.779092,-73.962932].\n- Show 1000 Fifth Ave, NY, NY, 10028 using an address string and display associated POIs near this address: [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/place?address=1000%20Fifth%20Ave,%20NY,NY,10028%20United%20States].\n- Show the place at PlaceID `IF149E70A3B3C4CB2` — American Museum of Natural History, 200 Central Park W, New York, NY 10024, United States — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/place?place-id=IF149E70A3B3C4CB2]. To find a specific Place ID, you can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MapKit\/MKMapItem] in AppKit and UIKit, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MapKitJS\/Place] in MapKitJS, or see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/maps\/place-id-lookup\/].\n- Show a place card at the specified coordinate with custom name you provide —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/place?coordinate=40.864791,-73.931723&name=My%20Favorite%20Place]. You can use this parameter when dropping a pin if you need to display a custom name for the place card.\n- Show a person’s current location — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/place?place-id=my-location]. This parameter requires that a person has given permission for Maps to display their location.\n- Show the location of a person’s parked car — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/place?place-id=parked-car]. This parameter requires that a person has given Maps permission to record the place they parked.\n\n## Explore the environment using Look Around\n\nUse the `\/look-around` path component and one of the following parameters to specify the initial location to start a session using Look Around.\n\n\n\nThe following examples demonstrate Look Around experiences in different cities:\n\n- The San Francisco Ferry Building — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/look-around?place-id=IBE1F65094A7A13B1]\n- The New York Stock Exchange, New York City, United States —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/look-around?coordinate=40.706974,-74.011281]\n- The Tower of London, London, United Kingdom — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/look-around?address=The%20Tower%20of%20London,London,UK]\n- The Eiffel Tower, Paris, France — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/look-around?address=The%20Eiffel%20Tower,Paris,France]\n\n## Request directions\n\nUse the `\/directions` path component and following query parameters in several combinations to request directions.\n\n\n\nYou can use the query parameters to the `directions` path in a large number of combinations to control how Maps displays directions. Limitations on the combinators or side effect that they may have are listed in the table above.\n\n- Show driving directions from a person’s current location to San Francisco City Hall: [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?destination=1%Dr.%20Carlton%20B.%20Goodlatte%20Place,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%94102,%20United%20States&mode=driving]].\n- Show the step-by-step walking directions from the San Franciso Ferry Building to San Francisco City Hall: [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?source=37.795442,-122.393624&destination=1%Dr.%20Carlton%20B.%20Goodlatte%20Place,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%94102,%20United%20States&mode=walking].\n- Show multistop driving directions to The San Francisco Ferry Building and San Francisco City Hall — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?destination=1%Dr.%20Carlton%20B.%20Goodlatte%20Place,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%94102,%20United%20States&waypoint=37.795442,-122.393624&mode=driving]. You can specify multiple `waypoint` parameters for different waypoints.\n- Show multistop driving directions, in New York City, from Riverside Park to The American Museum of Natural History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and The New York Public Library — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?source=328%10Riverside%20Drive,%20New%20York,NY%2010025&destination=200%20Central%20Park%20W%20New%20York,%20NY%2010024%20United%20States&waypoint=40.779092,-73.962932&waypoint=476%20Fifth%20Ave%20New%20York,%20NY%2010018%20United%20States&mode=driving].\n- Show transit directions from the New York Public Library to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?source=476%20Fifth%20Ave%20New%20York,%20NY%2010018%20United%20States&destination=200%20Central%20Park%20W%20New%20York,%20NY%2010024%20United%20States&mode=transit]. Leaving off the `source` instructs Maps to display directions using public transit to the specified destination from a person’s current location, which might not be practical depending on a person’s location.\n- Show driving directions from The American Museum of Natural History in New York City to Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York, avoiding tolls, if possible — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?source=476%20Fifth%20Ave%20New%20York,%20NY%2010018%20United%20States&destination=40.596896,-73.514907&mode=driving&avoid=tolls].\n- Show driving directions to 941 Alamo Dr, in San Francisco, CA avoiding tolls and highways, if possible — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?destination=941%20Alamo%20Dr,%20Vacaville,%20CA%20%2095687,%20United%20States&mode=driving&avoid=tolls,highways]. You can use ‘,’ as a separator to specify multiple `avoid` options.\n- Show walking directions from, a person’s current location to 1 La Avanzada St, San Francisco, CA avoiding highways, hills, stairs, and busy roads, if possible — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?destination=1%20La%20Avanzada%20St,%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%20%2094131,%20United%20States&mode=walking&avoid=highways,hills,stairs,busy-roads]. The `avoid` options are only applicable to their respective transportation modes.\n- Show transit directions from a person’s current location to Sausalito, preferring bus and ferry —  [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/directions?destination=Sausalito,%20CA,%20United%20States&transit-preferences=bus,ferry&mode=transit]. Leaving off the `source` instructs Maps to display directions using public transit to the specified destination from a person’s current location, which might not be practical depending on their location.\n\n## Find guides and curated places\n\nUsing the `\/guides` path component, you can ask Maps to provide details about place guides and curated collections using the following URL: [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/guides].\n\n## Report a problem\n\nIf you find an issue with Apple Maps, you can report a problem using the `\/report-a-problem path` component, followed by any of the following parameters:\n\n\n\n### Example problem reports\n\nYou can report a problem using the same kinds of location descriptors the other queries use. The following examples show how to report a problem using a coordinate, an address, or a Place ID.\n\n- Report a problem at the coordinate `40.753035,-73.981846` (The New York Public Library at 42nd St & 5th Ave in New York City) - [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/report-a-problem?coordinate=37.316115,-122.050910]\n- Report a problem at the address 1000 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028 United States — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/report-a-problem?address=1000%20Fifth%20Ave%20New%20York%20NY%2100284%20United%20States]\n- Report a problem at Place ID `IBE1F65094A7A13B1`, the San Francisco Ferry Building — [https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/report-a-problem?place-id=IBE1F65094A7A13B1]\n\nWhen you open the `report-a-problem` URL, Maps opens a problem report sheet to ask a person for more detail on the nature of the problem, which Apple uses to investigate the report.\n\n## Retrieve a full Maps URL from a shortened URL\n\nWhen people share a map URL from Maps, this system creates a shortened version that’s more efficient to send in the app, for example, Messages or Mail. If you need to recover the full URL, follow these steps:\n\n1. Check to see if the URL is a shortened Apple Maps URL; the host portion of an Apple shortened Maps URLs always end in `maps.apple` (no `.com`).\n2. Attempt to access the URL programmatically, the full Apple Maps URL is accessible from the `HTTP 301` redirect response that the `maps.apple` server returns.\n\n## The MapKit APIs\n\n- **MapKit for AppKit and UIKit**\n- **MapKit for SwiftUI**: MapKit for SwiftUI allows you to build map-centric views and apps across Apple platforms. You can design expressive and highly interactive Maps with minimal code by composing views, using ViewBuilders and view modifiers.\n\n",
