If your app provides navigation services and you want it to optionally become the default navigation app, there are several steps you need to take.\n\n## Add the Default Navigation App entitlement\n\nIn Xcode, add the `com.apple.developer.navigation-app` entitlement to the `.entitlements` file for your app’s project. For instructions on how to add this entitlement, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.navigation-app].\n\n## Adopt the geonavigation URL scheme\n\nTo provide navigation capabilities in your app, you need to adopt the `geo-navigation:\/\/` URL scheme. This scheme accepts the following types of navigation queries:\n\n\n\nYou can use several of these parameters in combination to provide a number of action types, including:\n\n- Providing the source and destination for a route.\n- Providing the source, the destination, and one or more waypoints between the starting point and the final destination. You can provide these as strings that represent an address, a place-name, or a comma-separated pair of floating-point values for the latitude and longitude of the location as coordinates on the map.\n\n\n\n## Add the geonavigation URL type support and URL scheme\n\nUse the following steps to add the `geo-navigation` support to your app’s `Info.plist` file:\n\n1. In your app’s Xcode project, select the `Info.plist` file in the Project navigator.\n2. Expand the information property list by clicking its disclosure triangle to display the resources that the `Info.plist` file contains.\n3. Open the URL Types array (or add a URL Types array, if necessary, by creating an entry and selecting URL Types from the pop-up menu).\n4. Add a URL Schemes array to the URL Types array.\n5. Add a string for the URL Schemes array and set its value to `geo-navigation`.\n\n\n\nBefore your app can open incoming `geo-navigation:`  URLs, it needs to support this scheme as a custom URL scheme. To add this support, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app].\n\n## Prepare your app for submission to App Store Connect\n\nTo submit your app to App Store Connect, it needs to meet the following criteria:\n\n- The `com.apple.developer.navigation-app` entitlement is in your app’s `.entitlements` file, and has a value of `true`.\n- Your app is able to handle the `geo-navigation:\/\/` URL schema.\n- The `Info.plist` file has the `UIBackgroundModes` property array and contains an entry with the string `location`.\n\n",
