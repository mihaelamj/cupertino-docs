After making a request, MapKit delivers the results asynchronously to the completion handler that you provide. You can also get the estimated travel time for the route.\n\nEach `MKDirections` object handles a single request for directions, although you can cancel and restart that request as needed. You can create multiple instances of this class and process different route requests at the same time, but make requests only when you plan to present the corresponding route information to the user. Apps may receive an [doc:\/\/com.apple.mapkit\/documentation\/MapKit\/MKError\/Code\/loadingThrottled] error if the device makes too many requests in too short a time period.",
