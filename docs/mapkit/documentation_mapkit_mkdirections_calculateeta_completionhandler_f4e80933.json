Travel-time estimates take much less time to generate than directions, so use this method in situations where you want a time estimate only. The method executes your completion handler on your app’s main thread. The implementation of your handler needs to check for errors and then incorporate the response data as appropriate.\n\nIf you call this method while a previous request is in process, this method calls your completion handler with an error. You can determine whether a request is in process by checking the value of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.mapkit\/documentation\/MapKit\/MKDirections\/isCalculating] property. You can also cancel a request as necessary.",
