The snapshotter needs to render the final image while your app is in the foreground. If you start generating a snapshot while the app is in the background, or if your app moves to the background while a snapshot is in progress, this behavior delays the delivery of the snapshot until your app returns to the foreground.\n\nIn macOS, this method creates both standard and high-resolution representations of the map data and includes both in the returned image object.
