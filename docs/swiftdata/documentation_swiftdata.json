classes to SwiftData using the framework’s macros, and store instances of those models so they exist beyond the app’s runtime.\n- **Adding and editing persistent data in your app**: Create a data entry form for collecting and changing data managed by SwiftData.\n- **Adopting SwiftData for a Core Data app**: Persist data in your app intuitively with the Swift native persistence framework.\n- **SwiftData updates**: Learn about important changes to SwiftData.\n- **Adopting inheritance in SwiftData**: Add flexibility to your models using class inheritance.\n\n## Model definition\n\n- **Model()**: Converts a Swift class into a stored model that’s managed by SwiftData.\n- **Attribute(_:originalName:hashModifier:)**: Specifies the custom behavior that SwiftData applies to the annotated property when managing the owning class.\n- **Unique(_:)**: Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to enforce the uniqueness of model instances.\n- **Index(_:)**: Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to create one or more binary indices for the associated model.\n- **Index(_:)**: Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to create one or more indicies for the associated model, where each index is either binary or R-tree.\n- **Defining data relationships with enumerations and model classes**: Create relationships for static and dynamic data stored in your app.\n- **Relationship(_:deleteRule:minimumModelCount:maximumModelCount:originalName:inverse:hashModifier:)**: Specifies the options that SwiftData needs to manage the annotated property as a relationship between two models.\n- **Transient()**: Tells SwiftData not to persist the annotated property when managing the owning class.\n\n## Model life cycle\n\n- **ModelContainer**: An object that manages an app’s schema and model storage configuration.\n- **ModelContext**: An object that enables you to fetch, insert, and delete models, and save any changes to disk.\n- **Fetching and filtering time-based model changes**: Track all inserts, updates, and deletes that occur in a data store and process them as a series of chronological transactions.\n- **HistoryDescriptor**: A type that describes the criteria, and, optionally, sort order, to use when fetching history data\n- **Deleting persistent data from your app**: Explore different ways to use SwiftData to delete persistent data.\n- **Reverting data changes using the undo manager**: Automatically record data change operations that people perform in your SwiftUI app, and let them undo and redo those changes.\n- **Syncing model data across a person’s devices**: Add the required capabilities and define a compatible schema to enable SwiftData to automatically sync your app’s model data using iCloud.\n- **Concurrency support**: Types you use to access model attributes and perform storage-related tasks in a safe and isolated way.\n\n## Model fetch\n\n- **Filtering and sorting persistent data**: Manage data store presentation using predicates and dynamic queries.\n- **Query()**: Fetches all instances of the attached model type.\n- **Additional query macros**: Supplementary macros that enable you to narrow query results and tell SwiftData how to sort and order those results.\n- **Query**: A type that fetches models using the specified criteria, and manages those models so they remain in sync with the underlying data.\n- **FetchDescriptor**: A type that describes the criteria, sort order, and any additional configuration to use when performing a fetch.\n\n## Model storage\n\n- **Maintaining a local copy of server data**: Create and update a persistent store to cache read-only network data.\n- **DefaultStore**: A data store that uses Core Data as its undelying storage mechanism.\n- **DataStore**: An interface that enables SwiftData to read and write model data without knowledge of the underlying storage mechanism.\n- **DataStoreBatching**: An interface that enables a custom data store to support batch requests.\n- **HistoryProviding**: An interface that enables a custom data store to provide the history of changes for its persisted models.\n- **Building a document-based app using SwiftData**: Code along with the WWDC presenter to transform an app with SwiftData.\n- **ModelDocument**: A document type that uses SwiftData to manage its storage.\n\n## History life cycle\n\n- **HistoryChange**: Values that describe data history transactions.\n- **HistoryDelete**: An interface that enables a custom data store to delete items from the history of changes to its persisted models.\n- **HistoryInsert**\n- **HistoryToken**\n- **HistoryTransaction**\n- **HistoryUpdate**\n- **HistoryTombstone**\n- **DefaultHistoryInsert**\n- **DefaultHistoryUpdate**\n-
