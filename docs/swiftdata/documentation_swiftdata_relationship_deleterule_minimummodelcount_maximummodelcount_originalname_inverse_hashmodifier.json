For possible values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftData\/documentation\/SwiftData\/Schema\/Relationship\/Option].\n- **deleteRule**: The rule to apply when you delete the relationship’s owning persistent model. For possible values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftData\/documentation\/SwiftData\/Schema\/Relationship\/DeleteRule-swift.enum]. The default value is [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftData\/documentation\/SwiftData\/Schema\/Relationship\/DeleteRule-swift.enum\/nullify].\n- **minimumModelCount**: The minimum number of models the relationship can reference. The default value is `0`.\n- **maximumModelCount**: The maximum number of models the relationship can reference. The default value is `0`.\n- **originalName**: The previous name of the attribute, if it’s different to the one in the current schema version. The default value is `nil`.\n- **inverse**: The key path of the relationship that represents the inverse of this relationship. The default value is `nil`.\n- **hashModifier**: A unique hash value that represents the most recent version of the annotated property. The default value is `nil`.\n\n## Overview\n\nIf one or more of a model’s properties represent relationships between their containing model and another model, annotate those properties with the `@Relationship` macro. This enables SwiftData to enforce those relationships at runtime — including what happens if you delete related data – as well as write any associated metadata to the persistent storage so the relationships exist across app launches.\n\nIn the following example, a remote image may belong to a category, and a category can contain zero, one, or more images.\n\n```swift\n@Model\nclass RemoteImage {\n    @Attribute(.unique) var sourceURL: URL\n    @Relationship(inverse: \\Category.images) var category: Category?\n    var data: Data\n\n    init(sourceURL: URL, data: Data = Data()) {\n        self.sourceURL = sourceURL\n        self.data = data\n    }\n}\n\n@Model\nclass Category {\n    @Attribute(.unique) var name: String\n    @Relationship var images = [RemoteImage]()\n\n    init(name: String) {\n        self.name = name\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nFor more information about defining relationships between models, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.SwiftData\/documentation\/SwiftData\/Defining-data-relationships-with-enumerations-and-model-classes].\n\n## Model definition\n\n- **Model()**: Converts a Swift class into a stored model that’s managed by SwiftData.\n- **Attribute(_:originalName:hashModifier:)**: Specifies the custom behavior that SwiftData applies to the annotated property when managing the owning class.\n- **Unique(_:)**: Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to enforce the uniqueness of model instances.\n- **Index(_:)**: Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to create one or more binary indices for the associated model.\n- **Index(_:)**: Specifies the key-paths that SwiftData uses to create one or more indicies for the associated model, where each index is either binary or R-tree.\n- **Defining data relationships with enumerations and model classes**: Create relationships for static and dynamic data stored in your app.\n- **Transient()**: Tells SwiftData not to persist the annotated property when managing the owning class.\n\n",
