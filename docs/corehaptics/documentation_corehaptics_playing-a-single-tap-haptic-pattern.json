  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis article describes how to define the haptic pattern for a single haptic tap and how to play that haptic pattern through a haptic engine.\n\n### Create a haptic engine\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticEngine] is your app’s interface to the haptic device. An instance of a haptic engine allows you to create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticPatternPlayer] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer] to play individual haptics. Create the haptic engine as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/preparing-your-app-to-play-haptics].\n\n### Specify a dictionary literal\n\nThe next step is to create a dictionary literal representing the haptic. The following represents a single haptic tap:\n\nEach entry in the dictionary shown above is a haptic event, with an event type, a start time, and a duration. In this case, the event type is [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticEvent\/EventType\/hapticTransient] because a single tap is a transient pattern — a quick impulse. The time is `CHHapticTimeImmediate` to indicate that the event begins immediately, right after time `0`. The duration of `1.0` indicates that the event lasts one second.\n\n### Create a haptic pattern player from the dictionary\n\nInitialize a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticPattern] from the dictionary you just created.\n\nWhen you’re ready to play your haptic, create a player for that pattern. Each player is responsible for playing one pattern. You can reuse a player to play its pattern as many times as you like.\n\nUse one of the haptic engine’s factory methods, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticEngine\/makePlayer(with:)], to create the haptic pattern player.\n\nIf you call [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticPatternPlayer\/start(atTime:)] on a player that’s already playing, it restarts itself at the beginning of the pattern.\n\nHaptic players are inexpensive, lightweight objects, so create and discard them freely. Unless your app requires real-time, latency-free haptic feedback in response to user interaction — like precise ticks on a dial — you can create your player right before playing the haptic.\n\n### Start the engine and play the haptic pattern\n\nStart the haptic engine before you play a haptic player, and stop the engine once you’ve finished playing all haptic patterns. Play the haptic by calling the player’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticPatternPlayer\/start(atTime:)] method.\n\nIf the engine is in a running state when you call [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticEngine\/start()], the system plays the haptic at the scheduled time. Playback follows a “fire and forget” model, so your app doesn’t need to keep the player and pattern in memory once you’ve called [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticEngine\/start()]. You need to retain your engine so it doesn’t exit scope during your program.\n\nUnless you’re playing several haptic patterns in succession, bookend haptic playback with starting and stopping the engine. Starting the engine ensures that the haptic engine is in a running state when you schedule a haptic to play. Stopping the engine after you finish playing the haptic conserves power and allows it to prepare for the next time your app needs haptic playback. Be aware that your engine may stop on its own in auto-shutdown mode.",
