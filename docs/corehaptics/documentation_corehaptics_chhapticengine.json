The haptic engine establishes the connection between your app and the underlying device hardware. Even though you can define a haptic pattern without an engine, you need the engine to play that pattern.\n\n\n\nEven though your app makes a request through the haptic engine, the operating system could still override the request with system services, like haptics from system notifications.\n\n### Prepare Your App To Play Haptics\n\nTo prepare your app to play haptics, follow these steps, as demonstrated in the code below:\n\n1. Create a haptic engine instance. Maintain a strong reference to it so it doesn’t go out of scope while the haptic is playing.\n2. Call the haptic engine’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticEngine\/start(completionHandler:)] for an asynchronous start, or [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticEngine\/start()] to start the engine synchronously (immediately).\n3. Stop the engine by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticEngine\/stop(completionHandler:)] when your app finishes haptic playback.\n\n\n\nAlthough it’s possible to create content—[doc:\/\/com.apple.corehaptics\/documentation\/CoreHaptics\/CHHapticPattern] instances—independent of a CHHapticEngine, your app must use an engine to play that content.\n\n## Initializing a Haptic Engine\n\n- **init()**: Creates an instance of the haptic engine.\n- **init(audioSession:)**: Creates a haptic engine from an audio session.\n\n## Starting and Stopping the Haptic Engine\n\n- **start()**: Synchronously starts the haptic engine.\n- **start(completionHandler:)**: Asynchronously starts the haptic engine.\n- **stop(completionHandler:)**: Asynchronously stops the haptic engine and executes the completion handler once the engine has stopped.\n- **CHHapticEngine.CompletionHandler**: A typealias for a completion handler that the engine calls after starting or stopping.\n\n## Creating Haptic Pattern Players\n\n- **makePlayer(with:)**: Creates a standard haptic pattern player from a haptic pattern.\n- **makeAdvancedPlayer(with:)**: Creates an advanced haptic pattern player from a haptic pattern.\n\n## Modifying Playback Properties\n\n- **playsAudioOnly**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the engine ignores haptic events and plays audio events only.\n- **playsHapticsOnly**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the engine ignores audio events.\n- **isMutedForAudio**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the engine mutes audio.\n- **isMutedForHaptics**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the engine mutes haptics.\n\n## Playing a Pattern\n\n- **playPattern(from:)**: Plays a pattern that’s defined in a file at the specified URL.\n- **playPattern(from:)**: Plays a pattern from the specified data.\n\n## Registering Audio Resources\n\n- **registerAudioResource(_:options:)**: Registers an external audio to use as a custom waveform.\n- **unregisterAudioResource(_:)**: Unregisters an external audio file that you previously registered with the engine.\n- **CHHapticAudioResourceID**: A type that identifies a custom audio resource.\n\n## Monitoring Finished Playback\n\n- **notifyWhenPlayersFinished(finishedHandler:)**: Notifies you when all haptic pattern players have finished playing their haptic patterns.\n- **CHHapticEngine.FinishedHandler**: A type alias for a completion handler to execute after finishing haptic playback.\n- **CHHapticEngine.FinishedAction**: Possible actions to take after the haptic engine finishes execution.\n\n## Handling Haptic Engine Resets\n\n- **resetHandler**: A block that the haptic engine calls after recovering from a haptic server error.\n- **CHHapticEngine.ResetHandler**: A typealias for the block that the haptic engine calls after being reset.\n\n## Handling Haptic Engine Stoppages\n\n- **stoppedHandler**: A closure the haptic engine calls when it stops due to external causes.\n- **CHHapticEngine.StoppedHandler**: A typealias for the block that the haptic engine calls after it stops due to an external cause.\n- **CHHapticEngine.StoppedReason**: The enumeration of reasons the haptic engine stopped running.\n\n## Getting the Current Media Time\n\n- **currentTime**: The absolute time, in seconds, to use for scheduling haptic and audio events.\n- **CHHapticTimeImmediate**: A time constant used to schedule a command immediately.\n\n## Querying System Capabilities\n\n- **capabilitiesForHardware()**: Returns a device capability object that describes the device’s haptic support and limitations.\n- **CHHapticDeviceCapability**: A protocol that defines haptics and audio capabilities of a device.\n- **CHHapticParameterAttributes**: A protocol for providing default, mininum, and maximum values of a parameter.\n- **attributes(forDynamicParameter:)**: Requests the haptic device’s attributes for a dynamic parameter.\n\n## Managing Power\n\n- **isAutoShutdownEnabled**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the haptic engine starts and stops automatically on request from one of its pattern players, or when idle.\n\n## Instance Properties\n\n- **intendedSpatialExperience**: The CHHapticEngine’s intended [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/SpatialAudioExperience].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Preparing your app to play haptics**: Set up your app to play haptics.\n- **Playing a single-tap haptic pattern**: Create and play a transient haptic pattern from a dictionary literal inline.\n- **CHHapticPattern**: An object representing a haptic waveform.\n- **CHHapticPatternPlayer**: A protocol that defines a standard pattern player capable of playing haptic patterns with fixed parameters.\n- **CHHapticAdvancedPatternPlayer**: A protocol that defines an advanced pattern player capable of looping, seeking, pausing, and resuming haptic playback.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n-
