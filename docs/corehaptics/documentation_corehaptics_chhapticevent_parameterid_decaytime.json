  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis parameter can be an event parameter or a dynamic parameter. A fixed value indicates that the haptic begins decreasing in intensity at the set time, where time `0` indicates now, or the current time.\n\nA dynamic value indicates that the start time of the decrease can change. For example, a value of `0` indicates that the decay time is at its default value. Positive values up to `1.0` increase the decay time exponentially, while negative values down to `-1.0` decrease the decay time exponentially.\n\nHaptic intensity responds to this parameter. For example, the following graphic shows the intensity of a haptic pattern in gray. At the beginning, the haptic pattern’s intensity increases from zero to its final value over a certain amount of time; this duration is called the *attack*. As the haptic pattern reaches its end, the intensity gradually transitions to zero over a certain amount of time; this duration is called the *decay*.\n\n",
