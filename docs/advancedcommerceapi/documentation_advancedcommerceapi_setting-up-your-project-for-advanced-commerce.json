  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis framework enables you to offer a large catalog of one-time purchases, subscriptions, and bundled content while using the App Store commerce system. To request access to the API, see the Advanced Commerce API Access form on the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/in-app-purchase\/advanced-commerce-api\/] page. After your app receives access, complete the setup to start using the API in your app and on your server.\n\n### Create generic product identifiers\n\nThe Advanced Commerce API relies on up to four generic product identifiers that you create in App Store Connect. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/setting-up-generic-product-identifiers] to determine which generic product IDs you need, and how to create them. Send the generic product identifiers to Apple using the Advanced Commerce API Access form on the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/in-app-purchase\/advanced-commerce-api\/] page.\n\n### Set up your server\n\nSet up your server to do the following:\n\n### Create a deep link to manage subscriptions in your app\n\nCreate a deep link into your app that opens a page for customers to manage their subscriptions. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/setupmanagesubscriptions]. Send the deep link to Apple using the Advanced Commerce API Access form on the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/in-app-purchase\/advanced-commerce-api\/] page.\n\n### Review tax codes for your SKUs\n\nReview the tax codes you use for your SKUs from the list in [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/taxcodes]. If you need to request additional tax codes, send your request using the Advanced Commerce API Access form on the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/in-app-purchase\/advanced-commerce-api\/] page.\n\n### Define and manage your SKUs\n\nDefine your SKUs using the best practices for naming and design. For more information, and to learn where the system displays the SKU data you provide, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/creating-your-purchases]. For more design guidance, see Human Interface Guidelines > [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/in-app-purchase]. To define SKUs for the Mini Apps Partner Program, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/creating-skus-for-the-mini-app-partner-program].\n\n### Test your app\n\nWhen you implement the Advanced Commerce API in your app and on your server, you can test in the sandbox environment before sending it to App Review. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/testing-in-app-purchases-with-sandbox].\n\n### Set up an image for the payment sheet to display\n\nWhen customers make a purchase, the payment sheet displays your app icon by default. You can optionally provide an image to use instead, in App Store Connect. To set it up, see the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-in-app-purchases\/view-and-edit-in-app-purchase-information] topic. Set up one image for the generic product ID that represents your subscriptions, and one for the generic product ID that represents your one-time purchases. For more information on the payment sheet and SKU information that the system displays to customers, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/creating-your-purchases].",
