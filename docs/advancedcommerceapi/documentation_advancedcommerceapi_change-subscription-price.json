Based on the type of price change, you might need to communicate the change to customers or get their consent. For information about the communication requirements including their timing, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/handling-subscription-price-changes].\n\nOnly active subscriptions that aren’t in a billing retry state are eligible for price changes.

You can call this endpoint anytime you want to decrease prices.\n- Increasing subscription prices requires you to notify the customer in advance. Some price increases also require you to obtain the customer’s consent. To determine whether you need price consent and for information about customer communications and their timing, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/handling-subscription-price-changes].\n\n\n\n### Increase price of a SKU\n\nIf you’re increasing the price of any SKU associated with a subscription (such as the subscription itself, a bundle, or an individual item), follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine whether the price increase requires customer consent.\n2. If the increase doesn’t require customer consent, notify the customer of the price increase in advance, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/handling-subscription-price-changes]. Then, call this endpoint after you notify the customer.\n3. If the increase requires customer consent, call this endpoint only if you’ve obtained the customer’s consent.  If you don’t obtain the customer’s consent to increase the price, don’t call this endpoint, and preserve the existing price.\n\n### Example request and response\n\nIn the following request:\n\n- The subscription includes multiple items, and only one item has a price increase to USD 12.99.\n- The price increase takes effect at the next subscription renewal.\n- The decoded signed transaction shows price in the current period, before the increase.\n- The decoded signed renewal information shows the increased price, which takes effect at the next renewal period.\n\n\n\n## Subscription price change from the server\n\n- **SubscriptionPriceChangeRequest**: The request body you use to change the price of an auto-renewable subscription.\n- **SubscriptionPriceChangeResponse**: A response that contains signed JWS renewal and JWS transaction information after a subscription price change request.\n\n",
