Apps that use this API host and manage their own catalog of In-App Purchases, or SKUs. The App Store commerce system handles the end-to-end payment processing, global distribution, tax support, and customer service.\n\nYou can use the Advanced Commerce API and the StoreKit [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/in-app-purchase] API in the same app. Both APIs use the App Store commerce system, including the same signed JWS transactions and JWS renewal info. For products that you offer using the In-App Purchase API, you set up product identifiers in App Store Connect. For products that you offer using the Advanced Commerce API, you host and manage your own catalog of SKUs and add product details dynamically at runtime. For complete setup information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/setting-up-your-project-for-advanced-commerce].\n\nAdvanced Commerce API features are available through requests you make using StoreKit in your app and endpoint requests from your server. To authorize these requests, you generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The App Store Server Library provides a client that makes it easier to create JWTs to authorize calls.

For more information about authorizing calls, see  [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/authorizing-server-calls].\n\nYour server must support the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol 1.2 or later to call the Advanced Commerce API.",
