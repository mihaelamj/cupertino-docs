Consider the following as you integrate the API:\n\n- If you periodically call the API, throttle your requests to avoid exceeding the per-hour limit for an endpoint.\n- Manage the `HTTP 429 RateLimitExceededError` in your error-handling process. For example, log the failure and queue the job to process it again at a later time.\n- Check the `Retry-After` header if you receive the `HTTP 429` error. This header contains a UNIX time, in milliseconds, that informs you when you can next send a request.\n\n## API authorization and rate limits\n\n- **Authorizing API requests from your server**: Create JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authorize Advanced Commerce requests from your server.\n\n",
