To increase the price of a subscription:\n\n1. Determine whether your price increase requires consent, based on the criteria described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/handling-subscription-price-changes#Request-consent-for-price-increases].\n2. Design your in-app sheet to notify or receive subscriber consent.\n3. Communicate with affected subscribers via email, price increase sheet, and push notification, following the timelines specified in the Subscription interval table below.\n4. If consent is required, record subscriber consent in your system for reference.\n5. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.advancedcommerceapi\/documentation\/AdvancedCommerceAPI\/Change-Subscription-Price] endpoint in the Advanced Commerce API to initiate a price change for the individual subscription item.\n\nOnce you notify customers using all required communications and gather applicable consent, you can call the API to change the price. After a successful API call to increase the price, Apple sends a push notification to subscribers notifying them of the increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Request consent for price increases\n\nIf any of the following apply, you must request consent from the subscriber:\n\n- The subscriber is located in a region that requires consent for any price changes. For more information about these regions, see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/#\/devf3e625675].\n- The price increase is:\n\n- More than 50 percent of the current price; and\n- The difference in price exceeds 5 United States Dollars (USD) per period for non-annual subscriptions, or 50 USD per year for annual subscriptions. International equivalents for prices not in USD are based on current exchange rates with specific thresholds subject to change based on changes in taxes or foreign exchange rates.\n- The subscriber had a price increase for the same subscription within the past 12 months.\n- The subscriber is located in South Korea and is converting from a free trial to a paid subscription, or from a discounted offer to a standard subscription price.\n\nWhen consent is required, you must notify subscribers via email, price increase sheet, and push notification, according to the timelines below. If a subscriber doesn’t take any action, you can continue to request consent no more than once per week for each method. You may not raise the price until you receive the subscriber’s consent.\n\nThe following notification timeline applies to all cases, except for subscribers in South Korea who are converting from free trials and discount offers:\n\n\n\nFor subscribers in South Korea who are converting from a free trial to a paid subscription, or from a discounted offer to a standard subscription price, use the following notification timelines:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Notify about price increases when consent isn’t needed\n\nWhen consent isn’t needed, you only need to notify subscribers about the new price.

Include these elements in your email and in-app notifications:\n\n- A header that makes it clear the communication is about a subscription price increase\n- Old price of the subscription\n- New price of the subscription\n- Date of the price increase\n- An easy way for subscribers to review or cancel their subscription.
