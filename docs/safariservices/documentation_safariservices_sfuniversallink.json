Typically, clicking a link in a browser takes a person to a website. However, the person may have an app that provides the same content and a better experience.\n\nA web browser uses the `SFUniversalLink` class to discover such applications and provide the person with additional options for interaction beyond the default browser behavior.\n\nIn order to use universal links, you need to use the entitlement [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.associated-domains.applinks.read-write] with a value of `true`. Before you submit an app with the entitlement to the App Store, you need to get permission to use the entitlement.
