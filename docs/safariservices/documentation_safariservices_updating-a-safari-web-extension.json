  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUpdate your Safari web extension by editing the generated files in your Xcode project to fix bugs, or by adding new source files to create new features.\n\nIf you prefer to use another editor for your source files, or if you want to preserve your existing development workflow for your converted web extension, edit your source files in an external source editor and use Xcode to update your extension in Safari.\n\nAdd new features with web extension APIs that work across browsers. For more information, see Mozilla’s [https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Mozilla\/Add-ons\/WebExtensions] documentation. For more information about web extension API compatibility in Safari, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/assessing-your-safari-web-extension-s-browser-compatibility].\n\n### Share your extension in Safari in iOS\n\nSafari supports web extensions in iOS 15 and later. To update your existing Xcode project with a macOS Safari web extension to support iOS, use the packager tool with the `--rebuild-project` option. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/packaging-a-web-extension-for-safari#Add-iOS-to-your-existing-Xcode-project].\n\n### Edit existing files in Xcode\n\nWhile Xcode is primarily for native development, it has built-in support for editing web source-code documents, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. In the Xcode Project navigator, select and edit the files you want to customize.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/creating-organizing-and-editing-source-files].\n\n### Edit existing files in an external editor\n\nIf you have an existing development workflow for your web extension, you can use another source editor for your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript extension files in the Resources group. Your changes are visible in Xcode when you save changes to your files.\n\nTo see and test your web extension changes in Safari, you need Xcode to build and package your extension updates in the macOS containing app, or to build and deploy your iOS containing app to a simulator or device:\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/running-your-safari-web-extension].\n\nIf your alternative source editor supports custom build commands, configure it to use `xcodebuild` from the command line to build your extension’s macOS app container.\n\nRun the `xcodebuild` command from the top directory of your Xcode project, and replace the `-scheme` parameter with the name of your Xcode project.\n\n### Add new files to your Safari web extension\n\nAdd new sources files for new features or to refactor existing features. To add a new source file to your web extension:\n\nXcode presents a list of templates for new source files. To add a new HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or JSON file:\n\nTo add an existing source file or image file from another directory, see the section titled “Add Existing Source Files to Your Project” in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/creating-organizing-and-editing-source-files].",
