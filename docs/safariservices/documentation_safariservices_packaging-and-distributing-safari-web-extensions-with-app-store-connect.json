After packaging your extension, you can use TestFlight to test your extension or submit it to the App Store for distribution.\n\nSafari web extension packager is also available as a command line tool which you can use alongside Xcode on a Mac. To learn more about using the command line tool, see doc:safari-web-extensions\/packaging-a-web-extension-for-safari.md.\n\n### Create an Apple Developer account\n\nTo access and use the Safari Extension Packager, you need to enroll your Apple account in the Apple Developer Program. For details on how to create an Apple Account and enroll in the Apple Developer program, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/enroll\/]\n\n### Create an app record\n\nTo create an app record, the Account Holder, Admin, or an App Manager opens [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com\/]. Alternately, a team member with a Developer or Marketing role with access to create app records in App Store Connect can create this app record.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nFor more information about creating an app record, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/create-an-app-record\/add-a-new-app\/].\n\n\n\n### Package the extension files\n\nAfter creating an app record, navigate to the Xcode Cloud tab. Under Safari Web Extension Packager, click Upload.\n\nSelect and upload your extension files. The Safari Web Extension Package assembles the app for your extension. You need to upload the full contents of your extension, including the manifest and all related resources.\n\nYou can see the status of the packaging process on the Builds page. You can upload multiple builds at once. When packaging is complete, distribute your extension to beta testers using TestFlight. For more information on using TestFlight, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases]\n\nReview any reported exceptions, and see [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/assessing-your-safari-web-extension-s-browser-compatibility] for details on how to resolve them.\n\n\n\n### Distribute to beta testers with TestFlight\n\nUse TestFlight to distribute beta builds of your app and extension, manage beta testers, and collect feedback. Make improvements to your extension and continue distributing builds until all issues are resolved before submitting your extension for App Store review and distribution.\n\nFor more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/test-a-beta-version\/testflight-overview].\n\n\n\n### Distribute on the App Store\n\nBefore submitting your app to the App Store for review, confirm that it’s ready for public release and that you’re making the most of your product page.\n\nBefore submission, [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/reference\/required-localizable-and-editable-properties] and decide whether to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-your-apps-availability\/select-an-app-store-version-release-option], or [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/update-your-app\/release-a-version-update-in-phases].\n\nWhen you’re ready to submit your app for review:\n\nOnce your app is approved and ready for distribution on the App Store, its status changes to “Ready for Distribution.” For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-your-apps-availability\/overview-of-publishing-your-app-on-the-app-store].",

Alternately, a team member with a Developer or Marketing role with access to create app records in App Store Connect can create this app record.\n\n\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. In Apps, click the Add button (+) on the top left.\n2. In the pop-up menu, select New App.\n3. In the New App dialog, select the platforms (macOS, iOS, or both), and enter the app information.\n\n- If you’re registered as a company, you have the option to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/create-an-app-record\/set-your-developer-name].\n- Choose a bundle identifier (ID) for your app. This uniquely identifies an app in the Apple ecosystem — every app needs a unique ID. It’s recommended that you use reverse domain-name notation, such as `com.example.MyApp`.\n- Choose a SKU for your app. This is a number you choose that helps you keep track of your app; the SKU isn’t viewable by people using your app.\n- Under User Access, choose Limited Access or Full Access. If you select Limited Access, choose who is able to access this app.\n4. Click Create. Then, check for messages that indicate missing information.\n\nFor more information about creating an app record, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/create-an-app-record\/add-a-new-app\/].\n\n\n\n### Package the extension files\n\nAfter creating an app record, navigate to the Xcode Cloud tab.
