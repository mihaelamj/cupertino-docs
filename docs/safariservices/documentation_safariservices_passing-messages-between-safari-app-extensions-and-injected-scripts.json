  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe injected script and your Safari app extension live in different sandboxed worlds, each with specific limits on what it can access. You can’t call directly from the native code in your app extension to the injected script running in the browser. However, some sort of communication between the two is almost always desirable. For example, you may have a toolbar or contextual menu item that you want to use to affect web content.\n\nThe solution is to pass messages between the injected script and the app extension. The two runtime environments share a common format for message passing, and each provides an interface for sending and receiving messages.\n\nThe complete workflow appears below:\n\n\n\nWithin the scripting environment, you have access to the `window` and `document` objects for the browser content, as well as a `safari` object. The `safari` object is an instance of the `SafariAppExtensionNamespace` class. It provides details about your app extension and support for passing messages between your injected script and the app extension.\n\nThis table describes your app extension’s key properties:\n\n### Send messages to the app extension\n\nCall `safari.extension.dispatchMessage.`\n\nThe parameter for [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/safariextensions\/safariappextension\/2048642-dispatchmessage] is a string that identifies the message you want to send.
