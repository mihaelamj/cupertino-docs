  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo add or override styles and behaviors in a webpage, you write style sheets and scripts that you then inject into your webpage to read and modify its content.\n\n### Add injected style sheets\n\nInjected style sheets function like user style sheets, as defined by the [https:\/\/www.w3.org]. The system adds styles in the following order:\n\nAt each stage, a new definition overrides any previous definition. The system adds style properties in your injected style sheets to existing page style properties, but your styles don’t override existing page styles unless you declare the new ones as `!important`.\n\nFor example, adding the following styles overrides a website using color text on a color background, and sets it to black text on a white background for a particular element:\n\n### Add injected scripts\n\nYou can inject `.js` files (text files that contain JavaScript functions and commands) into a webpage. The scripts in these files have access to the DOM of the webpages you inject them into. They have the same access privileges as scripts that execute from a webpage’s host. Injected scripts load each time a webpage loads, so keep them lightweight.\n\nThe system injects scripts into the top-level page and any subpages with HTML sources, such as iframes. Don’t assume that there’s only one instance of your script per browser tab. If you don’t want your injected script to execute inside iframes, preface your high-level functions with a test, as the following example shows:\n\nInjected scripts have an implied namespace — you don’t have to worry about your variable or function names conflicting with those of the website author, nor can a website author call functions in your extension. In other words, injected scripts and scripts that you include in the webpage run in isolated worlds, with no access to each other’s functions or data.",
