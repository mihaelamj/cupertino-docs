The project includes the Safari web extension as a macOS or iOS app extension that users can download from the App Store and install in Safari. The Xcode project includes default web extension files, such as the manifest, script files for a content page and background page, files for the toolbar pop-up menu, and folders for images and internationalization.\n\n### Create and configure the Xcode project\n\nTo create a new project in Xcode:\n\n1. In Xcode, choose File > New > Project.\n2. Select Multiplatform for your extension to work in both iOS and macOS, or select either the iOS or macOS platform for your extension to work for just that platform.\n3. In the Application section, click the Safari Extension App template.\n4. Click Next.\n\nXcode then displays the “Choose options for your new project” dialog, as in the following figure:\n\n\n\nProvide information in the dialog for Xcode to configure your project:\n\n1. In the Product Name field, enter a name for your extension. Xcode adds the name you enter here to the end of the extension’s bundle identifier.\n2. From the Team pop-up menu, select your Apple Developer team profile. If you don’t have an account, you can update this information later in the project settings.\n3. In the Organization Identifier field, enter a reverse DNS identifier for yourself or your organization (for example, com.example-organization). Xcode combines the organization identifier with the product name to construct the bundle identifier, which uniquely identifies your app in the App Store.\n4. If you’re working in macOS, click the Type pop-up menu and select Safari Web Extension, if necessary.\n5. Specify the Language as either Swift or Objective-C for code in the macOS app container for the web extension, or for messaging between the macOS app and the web extension.\n6. If your Safari web extension relies solely on JavaScript, deselect the Include Tests checkbox. Select Include Tests if you include Swift or Objective-C code for messaging between the iOS or macOS app and the web extension, and you want to build unit tests or UI tests with XCTest.\n7. Click Next and save the Xcode project to your Mac.\n\n\n\n### Review the generated web extension files and folders\n\nXcode generates the project, provides default versions of the files you need to create your Safari web extension, and organizes them into the groups and folders illustrated in the following figure:\n\n\n\nThe project contains default versions of web extension files in the Resources group:\n\n\n\n\n\nSee [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/running-your-safari-web-extension] to try out your web extension in Safari.\n\n### Replace the default icons and toolbar icons\n\nXcode provides default icons and toolbar icons for your Safari web extension in the Resources > images folder. Safari uses the icon images in Preferences > Extensions to display in the list of icons that the user can select to see more detail about your extension. Safari uses the toolbar icon images when your extension has a pop-up webpage that the user can access from Safari’s toolbar.\n\nReplace the default icons with icon images customized for your web extension.

Your app icons should relate visually to your extension icon and toolbar icon.
