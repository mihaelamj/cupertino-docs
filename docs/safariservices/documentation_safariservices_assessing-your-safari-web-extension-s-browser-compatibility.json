Review your extension implementation or planned approach, `manifest.json` key usage, and selected JavaScript APIs for incompatibilities, and get suggestions and workarounds for potential issues.\n\n### Review your implementation plan\n\nConsider these factors when reviewing your implementation plan for your Safari web extension, and make adjustments as needed:\n\n- Safari web extensions support both the `chrome.*` and `browser.*` namespaces. Use them as appropriate for your extension and your plan for browser compatibility.\n- Safari web extensions support both the callback and `Promise` approaches for asynchronous APIs. Use the most suitable approach for your code quality and browser compatibility.\n- Safari ignores file URL schemes in manifest permissions. If you use them, adjust your implementation.\n\n### Review your manifest\n\nGenerally, Safari web extensions ignore any unsupported manifest keys, but you may need to develop workarounds or alternative approaches for any incompatibilities. Check for these keys in your manifest and take action where needed:\n\n\n\nSafari 15.4 and later supports manifest versions 2 and 3.
