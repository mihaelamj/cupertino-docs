To inject your style sheet, you specify either `Some` or `All` website access for your app extension. In Safari 17 or later, users also need to grant your extension access to a website. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/adjusting-website-access-permissions]. For more information about injected style sheets, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/using-injected-style-sheets-and-scripts].\n\n### Add a style sheet\n\nAfter specifying website access, add the style sheet to your Safari app extension.\n\nYou can have more than one injected style sheet. Style sheets process in the order in which you specify them.\n\nYour style sheet can reference resources in your app extension’s bundle. All relative URLs are relative to the Resources folder in the app extension’s bundle.",

Add the CSS files to your extension’s Xcode target.\n2. Add an `SFSafariStyleSheet` key to the `NSExtension` element in your extension’s `Info.plist` file. The value for this key is an array of dictionaries.\n3. For each CSS file, add a dictionary to this array. Each dictionary must have a `Style Sheet` key with a value that specifies the path (relative to the Resources directory of the bundle) to the style sheet to include.\n\n\n\nYou can have more than one injected style sheet. Style sheets process in the order in which you specify them.\n\nYour style sheet can reference resources in your app extension’s bundle. All relative URLs are relative to the Resources folder in the app extension’s bundle.\n\n## Injected style sheets and scripts\n\n- **Using injected style sheets and scripts**: Learn how you can affect the appearance or behavior of a webpage by using injected style sheets and scripts.\n- **Injecting a script into a webpage**: Inject a script that you write for a Safari app extension into a webpage.\n- **Passing messages between Safari app extensions and injected scripts**: Communicate between your Safari app extension and injected scripts.\n- **SFSafariExtensionHandler**: A base class that you subclass to handle events in your Safari app extension.\n- **SFSafariExtensionManager**: A class that your app uses to find out the current state of a Safari app extension.\n- **SFSafariExtensionState**: The state of a Safari app extension.\n- **SFSafariPageProperties**: An object that captures information about a webpage.\n- **SFSafariExtensionHandling**: A protocol for implementing event handling in a Safari app extension.\n- **SFExtensionProfileKey**: A string the system uses as a key in a user info dictionary to identify a profile identifier.\n\n",
