Xcode includes a command-line tool to simplify this process.\n- Build a new Safari web extension in Xcode using the built-in template. You can then repackage the extension files for deployment in other browsers.\n- Temporarily install your web extension in Safari for testing without packaging it or setting up an Xcode project.
