Use a nonpersistent background page or service worker so that Safari can determine when to keep it in memory or unload it based on system memory usage.\n\nAs you update your Safari web extension to take advantage of new features that Safari supports, specify the Safari versions that your web extension is compatible with to avoid confusing your users.\n\n### Improve your extension experience in iOS\n\nThere are important differences in Safari between macOS and iOS that your extension needs to address to give users the best possible experience in iOS:\n\n### Edit the CSS files to support Dark Mode\n\nTo enable basic support for Dark Mode in your extension’s visual elements, add the following code to your CSS files:\n\nThis allows Safari to automatically adjust the visual element’s background color, text colors, and form element colors. For more information about how to customize your Dark Mode experience, see [https:\/\/webkit.org\/blog\/8840\/dark-mode-support-in-webkit\/].\n\n### Reduce memory and power usage with a nonpersistent background page\n\nConsider making your background page nonpersistent in macOS when it’s primarily event-driven and responds to user interactions. In iOS, you must make your background page nonpersistent. Safari unloads your nonpersistent background page when the user isn’t directly interacting with the extension, which reduces memory usage and improves battery life. Your background page must be nonpersistent or you must declare your background script as a service worker if you’re using manifest version 3. Use a service worker for better compatibility with other browsers.\n\nMake your background page nonpersistent by setting the `persistent` attribute to `false` in your extension’s `manifest.json` file.\n\nOr, declare your background script as a service worker.\n\nWhen you make your background page nonpersistent:\n\n### Ensure feature compatibility by specifying versions\n\nWhen you build features in your web extension that need a specific version of Safari, specify the required versions in your `manifest.json` file.\n\nProvide a specific version number in `strict_min_version` if you have a minimum Safari version requirement. Provide a specific version number in `strict_max_version` to limit the latest version of Safari that can use your Safari web extension.

Use a nonpersistent background page or service worker so that Safari can determine when to keep it in memory or unload it based on system memory usage.\n\nAs you update your Safari web extension to take advantage of new features that Safari supports, specify the Safari versions that your web extension is compatible with to avoid confusing your users.\n\n### Improve your extension experience in iOS\n\nThere are important differences in Safari between macOS and iOS that your extension needs to address to give users the best possible experience in iOS:\n\n- Users interact with the screen using their fingers instead of a mouse. Use pointer events instead of mouse events to handle touch interactions.\n- There are a number of different screen sizes for different devices and orientations. Make full page extensions and pop-up pages responsive to different sizes.\n- Some users prefer larger type on small screens. Support Dynamic Type in your web pages to let the user specify type size.\n- iOS doesn’t support some APIs. To prevent throwing exceptions, check for the existence of APIs in iOS before using them.\n\n### Edit the CSS files to support Dark Mode\n\nTo enable basic support for Dark Mode in your extension’s visual elements, add the following code to your CSS files:\n\n```other\n:root {\n    color-scheme: light dark;\n}\n```\n\nThis allows Safari to automatically adjust the visual element’s background color, text colors, and form element colors.
