If you have an extension for other browsers and a Safari app extension that offer the same features, you can replace your Safari app extension with a Safari web extension and share code.\n\n\n\nTo convert your Safari app extension to a Safari web extension:\n\n- Add new Safari web extension target(s) for macOS, iOS, or both to your project. Update the target(s) to include the icons, assets, and files you need from your Safari app extension. Link code and assets that you want to use from your extension for other browsers in your new Safari web extension target. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/updating-a-safari-web-extension] for more information.\n- Update the JavaScript APIs from your Safari app extension that are specific to Safari to use the Safari web extensions JavaScript APIs. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.safariservices\/documentation\/SafariServices\/assessing-your-safari-web-extension-s-browser-compatibility].\n- Update your `Info.plist` file to migrate your users (see details below).\n\n### Migrate your users to your Safari web extension\n\nTo replace your Safari app extension with a Safari web extension, you just need to update your `Info.plist` file to migrate your users from one to the other.\n\nAdd the `SFSafariAppExtensionBundleIdentifiersToReplace` key to the `NSExtension` element inside your Safari web extension’s `Info.plist` file.

Safari only migrates website permissions if the Safari web extension does not require more website access than the Safari app extension.\n\n## Extension conversions and packaging\n\n- **Packaging a web extension for Safari**: Package your existing extension as a Safari web extension using Xcode’s command-line tool.\n- **Packaging and distributing Safari Web Extensions with App Store Connect**: Upload and distribute Safari Web Extensions without using a Mac or Xcode.\n\n",
