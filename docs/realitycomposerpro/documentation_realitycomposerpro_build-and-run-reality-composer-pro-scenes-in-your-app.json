You can preview your scene directly in Reality Composer Pro on a visionOS device without having to build and run in Xcode. If you’re ready to test how your content runs in your app, you can build and run your app with either Xcode’s visionOS simulator or on a physical device.\n\n### Preview scenes on a device\n\nIf you have an Apple Vision Pro connected to your Mac, you can preview your scene on the device by selecting Preview > Play on the menu bar or by clicking on the Preview button in the Reality Composer Pro toolbar, represented by an Apple Vision Pro icon. If you have multiple Apple Vision Pro devices connected, choose which device to use by clicking the menu next to the Preview button.\n\n### Load scenes in your app’s view\n\nYou can load a Reality Composer Pro scene similar to how you load a `.usdz` asset from your app bundle. The difference is you have to specify the Reality Composer Pro package bundle instead. You can do this in the `make` closure of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/RealityKit\/RealityView] initializer.\n\nEach Reality Composer Pro package defines a global constant that points to its bundle. The system creates the bundle name by appending “Bundle” to the end of the project’s name.\n\nIn the default visionOS template in Xcode, the Reality Composer Pro project is called `RealityKitContent`, with the global bundle variable called `realityKitContentBundle`. The following code shows how to load the default bundle into a `RealityView`:\n\nWhen RealityKit finishes loading the scene, the `scene` variable contains the root entity of the specified scene and includes this content in `content`, which is then displayed by `RealityView` to the user.\n\n### Run the App with the Reality Composer Pro project\n\nTo build and run your Xcode project, choose Product > Run, or click the Run button in your project’s toolbar. You can test your app’s performance with either the visionOS simulator or a connected physical device.",
