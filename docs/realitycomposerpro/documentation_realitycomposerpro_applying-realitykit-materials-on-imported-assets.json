Reality Composer Pro displays any materials in the active scene in the hierarchy view, represented by a paintbrush icon.\n\n\n\nIf you select a material in the hierarchy view, you can edit it and adjust its values — such as Roughness, Opacity, and Emissive Color — using the inspector, as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\nA material’s inspector view contains three sections: References, Material, and Advanced. The References section lists any entities using the selected material, and allows you to add or remove references. The Material section contains a list of arguments that define the overal appearance of the material.\n\nThe Advanced section includes additional arguments you can use to fine-tune certain aspects of the selected material.\n\nIf you select a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material in the hierarchy view, you can edit it using the inspector. You can replace images, colors, or values for any of the PBR attributes with another image, color, or value of your choosing. Any changes you make to a material affect any entity that’s bound to that material. You can also create new materials from scratch by clicking the Add button (+) at the bottom of the scene hierarchy and choosing Material.",
