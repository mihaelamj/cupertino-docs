  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf you’re building an app for visionOS or using assets in RealityKit, Xcode provides a tool called Reality Composer Pro to help you create and design 3D content. With Reality Composer Pro, you can store your assets in a dedicated Swift package for a more efficient format.\n\nReality Composer Pro packages can include assets like images, 3D models, audio, and video files. Assets that you add to your Reality Composer Project are stored in the `realitykitcontent.rkassets` bundle, whereas the project’s source code resides in the Sources directory. The package also includes a file called `Package.realitycomposerpro` that contains the Reality Composer Pro project.\n\n### Create a visionOS project in Xcode\n\nWhen you create a visionOS project in Xcode, the editor automatically creates a default Reality Composer Pro project named `RealityKitContent`.\n\nTo create a visionOS project in Xcode, choose either App or Immersive Environmental App under the visionOS template tab.\n\nThen fill in the appropriate options for your new project, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\nThe new Xcode project contains two folders in the nagivator area: one with the same name as your app and another called Packages containing the Reality Composer Pro package. The `RealityKitContent` package contains a file called `Package.realitycomposerpro` that you can select to view a 3D visualization of the project in Xcode’s editor area.\n\n\n\nYou can launch Reality Composer Pro by double-clicking the `Package.realitycomposerpro` file in the navigator. Alternatively, if you have the file selected in the navigator, you can click the Open in Reality Composer Pro button located in the top right corner of the editor area. Double-clicking on any existing `.realitycomposerpro` files launches Reality Composer Pro and opens the selected project.\n\n### Create a new Reality Composer Pro package in an existing Xcode project\n\nTo add a Reality Composer Pro package to an existing Xcode project, you can create a new package with the editor by selecting Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Reality Composer Pro in the menu bar.\n\n\n\nIn the welcome window for Reality Composer Pro, choose Create New Project.\n\n\n\nThen choose a folder location and name for your Reality Composer Pro project. The project window opens to a new empty scene.\n\nYou need to add the package to your Xcode project to use it in your app. In Xcode’s navigation area, Control-click either the Xcode project at the top or a folder underneath it. Choose “Add Files to” in the contextual menu.\n\n\n\nLocate the Reality Composer Pro project folder in the pop-up window. Choose the project folder containing the Sources folder, Swift file, and Reality Composer Pro file, and click Add.\n\n\n\nYou can then either choose to Copy, Move, or Reference the files in place.\n\nThe Xcode project’s navigation area now contains the Reality Composer Pro project package and you can use it in your app.\n\n\n\nBy default, the code in the `ContentView` loads the 3D Scene from the Reality Composer Pro project into a `RealityView` within the SwiftUI view.\n\nTo learn how to load and view a scene from the Reality Composer Pro bundle in your app, see [doc:\/\/RealityComposerPro\/documentation\/RealityComposerPro\/Build-and-run-Reality-Composer-Pro-scenes-in-your-app].",
