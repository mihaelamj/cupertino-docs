  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nEmphasizing the edges of a model with an outline is an effective way to highlight and call attention to it, especially when it’s the target of a person’s gaze or interaction.\n\nOne way to add an outline to a model is to approximate the Fresnel effect, wherein the angle between the view direction and the surface normal of a model affects the shading around its edges. Specifically, you can highlight the edges of a model by taking the dot product between the view direction and the surface normal direction and applying an emissive color to the areas where the dot product is close to zero (that is, the vectors are perpendicular).

Create a custom Shader Graph material (Insert > Material > Shader Graph).\n2. Open the Shader Graph Editor by clicking the Shader Graph button.\n3. Add a `NodeGraph` node by clicking the New Node button or pressing the tab key and searching for “Node Graph”.\n4. Name the `NodeGraph` node “Fresnel”.\n5. Add a new input to the Fresnel node graph by selecting it and clicking the New Input button in the Inspector.\n6. Name the new input “Falloff” and give it a type of `Float`.\n7. Add a new output to the Fresnel node graph by selecting it and clicking the New Output button in the Inspector.\n8. Name the new output “Out” and give it a type of `Float`.\n\nThe following image shows the main body of the Shader Graph material:\n\n\n\n## Compose the Fresnel logic\n\nApproximate the Fresnel effect by taking the dot product between the view direction and the normal direction in the Fresnel node graph:\n\n1. Add a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/shadergraph\/realitykit\/view-direction-(realitykit)#Parameter-description] node and set its Space to `world`.\n2. Add a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/shadergraph\/geometric\/normal] node and set its Space to `world`.\n3. Take the dot product between the `View Direction` and `Normal` with a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/shadergraph\/math\/dot-product] node.\n4. Connect the output of the `Dot Product` node to the input of a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/shadergraph\/math\/clamp] node and set its `high` value to `1.0`.\n5. Connect the output of the `Clamp` node to the input of a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/shadergraph\/math\/one-minus-(realitykit)] node.\n6. Connect the output of the `One Minus` node to the top input of a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/shadergraph\/math\/power] node.\n7. Connect the `Falloff` input to the bottom input of the `Power` node.\n8. Connect the output of the `Power` node to the `Out` output.\n\nThe interior of the Fresnel node graph is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe following images show the result of each stage of the Fresnel node graph if it were fully connected:\n\n\n\nIn this case, the view direction and the normal direction are parallel at the center of the sphere, and become more perpendicular to each other toward the edges of the sphere, meaning the dot product ranges from a value of 1 at the center to a value of 0 near the edges. You can flip this by subtracting 1 from the dot product, and increase the rate of falloff by taking that value to a power.\n\n## Create an outline effect with the Fresnel node\n\nOne way to create an outline effect with the `Fresnel` node is by employing its output to apply an emissive color around the edges of a model. In the main graph of your shader:\n\n1. Add a new uniform input of type `Float` and name it “OutlineFalloff”.\n2. Connect the OutlineFalloff node to the `Falloff` input of the Fresnel node graph.\n3. Add a new uniform input of type `Color3 (Float)` and name it “OutlineColor”.\n4. Connect the OutlineColor node to the top input of a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/shadergraph\/math\/multiply] node.\n5. Connect the `Out` output of the Fresnel node graph to the bottom input of the `Multiply` node.\n6. Connect the output of the `Multiply` node to the `Emissive Color` input of the `Preview Surface` node.\n\nThe resulting graph is as follows:\n\n\n\nYou can adjust the `OutlineColor` input to change the color of the outline, and you can adjust the `OutlineFalloff` to control the rate of falloff for the Fresnel effect, as shown in the three examples below:\n\n\n\n## Shader Graph\n\n- **Designing materials with Shader Graph**: Create realistic materials with Shader Graph’s node editor in Reality Composer Pro.\n- **Loading entities with ShaderGraph materials**: Bring entities that contain materials created with Reality Composer Pro for use in your visionOS app.\n- **Creating a vertex displacement material with Shader Graph**: Animate the vertices of a mesh over time with 3D Perlin noise by creating a Shader Graph material.\n- **Correcting normals after vertex displacement with Shader Graph**: Approximate new vertex normals for materials that displace a mesh’s vertices.\n\n",
