  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nReality Composer Pro’s project window is the main interface for viewing, editing, creating and arranging 3D content for your Xcode project using RealityKit. With Xcode open, select XCode > Open Developer Tools > Reality Composer Pro to launch the welcome window.\n\nThe welcome window provides three options:\n\n\n\nReality Composer Pro stores each project file as a `.realitycomposerpro` file. To open the project window, you can choose to either create a new project or select an existing `.realitycomposerpro` file.\n\nThe project window is composed of multiple views:\n\n\n\n## Navigate in the viewport\n\nReality Composer Pro’s viewport provides an interactive way for you to view your project’s assets and scenes in 3D space. You can change how you interact with content and navigate around the scene by selecting a viewport mode. To select a mode, click on the corresponding button located at the bottom-left of the viewport. Additonally, you can change the mode in the menu bar by choosing Viewport and selecting one of the five modes. The viewport toolbar contains a button for Selection Mode, four navigation modes, a Camera Reset, and an Environmental Picker.\n\n\n\nThe four modes that move the viewport camera around in the scene are:\n\nYou can click on one of the viewport mode buttons and drag the cursor around to use the selected viewport mode quickly without having to change your current mode.\n\n### Interact with entites using Selection Mode\n\nThe first item in the viewport toolbar is Selection Mode, which allows you to select an entity in the viewport. With an entity selected, you can click on the manipulator and adjust its position, rotation, and scale. The viewpoint camera stays stationary when manipulating an entity.\n\nWith Selection Mode, you can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly choose one of the four types of viewport camera movements without having to switch.\n\nYou can perform a Marquee select by holding Shift and then clicking and dragging to create a selection box around multiple entities in the scene.\n\nIf you select an entity that is part of a reference, the root object that hosts the reference is also selected. To select a subentity object that is part of a reference, hold the Control key when clicking on the object.\n\n### Change the viewport environment\n\nYou can change the Reality Composer Pro viewport environment to test how your scene looks and sounds in different settings. To access the environment preview picker, select the environment picker icon on the viewport toolbar.\n\n\n\nThe environment preview picker provides some common backgrounds with lighting to use, and offers multiple acoustic environments.",

With Xcode open, select XCode > Open Developer Tools > Reality Composer Pro to launch the welcome window.\n\nThe welcome window provides three options:\n\n- Create New Project\n- Create New Object Capture Model\n- Open Existing Project\n\n\n\nReality Composer Pro stores each project file as a `.realitycomposerpro` file. To open the project window, you can choose to either create a new project or select an existing `.realitycomposerpro` file.\n\n\n\nThe project window is composed of multiple views:\n\n- The *toolbar* provides you quick access to actions and settings for your project. In the default toolbar, you can toggle the leading panel, send to device, switch between local space and world space, adjust the viewport camera settings, open the Content Library, and toggle the inspector. You can configure it to fit your project needs by adding and removing tools. To edit the toolbar, control-click the toolbar and select Customize Toolbar.\n- The *viewport* displays a 3D visual representation of the active scene. This view provides an interactive way to view, select, and manipulate your content from different positions and angles.\n- The *navigator* shows the hierarchy of all the assets in the current scene. You can add and remove assets, and adjust the relationship of multiple assets in the scene.\n- With the *inspector*, you can view and edit information about the scene or about the selected asset in the navigator or viewport. You can change the values of the components attached to the selected asset and add new components.\n- With the *editor*, you can manage your current project’s content, build materials for assets with Shader Graph, add timelines for animations, adjust the audio mix of the active scene, and see how the scene performs when running in a RealityKit app.\n\n\n\n## Navigate in the viewport\n\nReality Composer Pro’s viewport provides an interactive way for you to view your project’s assets and scenes in 3D space.
