To display a texture on a device’s screen, you need to create or acquire a drawable texture from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore].\n\nIn Metal, a *drawable* is a texture that bridges the display subsystem within [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore] to Metal. You can use a drawable as the output of a render pass and then present it to a display with its [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLDrawable] protocol.\n\nTo display content on a device’s screen, add one of these to your Metal app:\n\nWith a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/CAMetalLayer] instance, your app can get drawable instances by calling its [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/CAMetalLayer\/nextDrawable()] method. Each drawable conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/CAMetalDrawable] protocol, which has a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/CAMetalDrawable\/texture] property that a render pass can use as its output.
