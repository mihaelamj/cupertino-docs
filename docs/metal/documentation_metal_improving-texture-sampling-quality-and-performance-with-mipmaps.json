A texture’s *mipmap chain* is its complete set of mipmaps. Textures with mipmaps can help your app eliminate common visual problems, such as aliasing and moire patterns, while reducing the GPU’s memory bandwidth.\n\n__The largest version of a texture is mipmap `0` and it’s at the top of the mipmap chain. The next largest version is mipmap `1`, which is one level lower in the chain.\n\n\n\nEach nonzero mipmap level is 25% of the area of the previous mipmap level in the chain. A texture’s smallest mipmap is at least 1 pixel in each dimension.\n\nA mipmapped texture gives the GPU the option to sample from a mipmap size that’s closest to the size of the primitive it’s rendering to. A GPU’s texture-sampling hardware works best when a texture’s dimensions are similar to the output primitive’s dimensions.
