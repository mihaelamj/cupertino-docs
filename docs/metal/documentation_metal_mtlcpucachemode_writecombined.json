On some implementations, writes may bypass caches to avoid cache pollution. Read actions may perform very poorly.\n\nApplications should use write combining only if writing to normally cached buffers is known to cause performance issues due to cache pollution, as write-combined memory can have surprising performance pitfalls.  Another approach is to use non-temporal writes to normally cached memory (STNP on ARMv8, _mm_stream_* on x86_64).",
