  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA render pass draws a scene, or a component within a scene, to its render *attachments*, the outputs of a render pass. You can render to those outputs with various approaches, including techniques that apply the following:\n\nTo create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderCommandEncoder] instance, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCommandBuffer\/makeRenderCommandEncoder(descriptor:)] method of an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCommandBuffer] instance, or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLParallelRenderCommandEncoder\/makeRenderCommandEncoder()] method of an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLParallelRenderCommandEncoder] instance.\n\nTo configure the render pass for your first drawing commands, start with a pipeline state by passing an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderPipelineState] instance to the encoder’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderCommandEncoder\/setRenderPipelineState(_:)] method. You create the pipeline states your render pass needs, typically ahead of time, by calling one or more [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLDevice] methods (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/pipeline-state-creation]).\n\nConfigure other encoder settings by calling the methods on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/render-pass-configuration] page. For example, you may need to configure the pass’s viewport, its scissor rectangle, and the settings for depth and stencil tests.\n\nAssign resources, such as buffers and textures, for the shaders that depend on them. For more information, see the shader-specific pages in the resource preparation section, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/vertex-shader-resource-preparation-commands] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/fragment-shader-resource-preparation-commands]. If your shaders access resources through an argument buffer, make those resources *resident* in GPU memory by calling the methods on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/argument-buffer-resource-preparation-commands] page.\n\nEncode drawing commands after you configure the state and resources the commands depend on. The encoder maintains its current state and applies it to all subsequent draw commands. For drawing commands that need different states or resources, reconfigure the render pass appropriately and then encode those draw commands. Repeat the process for each batch of drawing commands that depend on the same render pass configuration and resources.\n\nWhen you finish encoding the render pass’s commands, finalize it into the command buffer by calling the encoder’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCommandEncoder\/endEncoding()] method.\n\n### Command stages\n\nMost render commands apply to one or more stages within a pass. The following table shows which stages apply to each command:\n\nDraw commands don’t apply to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLStages\/fragment] when the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderPipelineState] for the draw disables rasterization. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor\/isRasterizationEnabled].\n\nMesh draw commands don’t apply to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLStages\/object] when the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderPipelineState] for the draw doesn’t have an object shader.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderCommandEncoder\/executeCommandsInBuffer(_:range:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderCommandEncoder\/executeCommandsInBuffer(_:indirectBuffer:offset:)] commands don’t apply to any stage, which means you can’t use a barrier to wait for all commands in an indirect command buffer to complete. However, each command within the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLIndirectCommandBuffer] applies to the same stages as when you encode the equivalent command directly.\n\nFor more information about stages and synchronization, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLStages] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/resource-synchronization].",
