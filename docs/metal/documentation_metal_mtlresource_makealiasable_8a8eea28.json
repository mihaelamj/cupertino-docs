Allocate an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLHeap] instance to hold your task’s resources, using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLDevice\/makeHeap(descriptor:)] method. Your heap should be big enough to store the maximum amount of concurrently loaded data you expect.\n2. Allocate your resource(s) using a heap method that returns an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLResource] instance.\n3. Perform your stage on the GPU, and when it completes, mark the resource allocation(s) as aliasable by calling this method.\n4. For each successive stage of your overall pass, repeat steps 2 and 3. Ensure that the prior stage fully completes before making any new resources on an aliasable heap through an event or fence.\n\n## Managing heap resources\n\n- **heapOffset**: The distance, in bytes, from the beginning of the heap to the first byte of the resource, if you allocated the resource on a heap.\n- **heap**: The heap on which the resource is allocated, if any.\n- **isAliasable()**: A Boolean value that indicates whether future heap resource allocations may alias against the resource’s memory.\n\n",
