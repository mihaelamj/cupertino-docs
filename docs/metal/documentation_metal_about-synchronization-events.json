An event starts with a value of `0`. You can either update the event’s value by *signaling* it, or block further execution by *waiting* on the event. Typically, you keep an integer value in your app for each event and increase its value each time you need to synchronize on the event.

Metal signals the event after all scheduled commands prior to the event have finished, updating the event’s value if the new value is larger than its current value.\n\nTo wait for an event to be signaled, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCommandBuffer\/encodeWaitForEvent(_:value:)] on a command buffer, passing in the value to wait for. Commands that are after this event on the queue don’t run until the event’s value is at least as large as the value you provide.",
