You do this by creating an encoder that indirectly adds commands for a pass (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/command-encoder-factory-methods]) to the command buffer. Command buffers also have some methods that directly encode commands between passes, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCommandBuffer\/encodeSignalEvent(_:value:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCommandBuffer\/present(_:)].\n\nEach command buffer’s state can only change to a state below it in the table, and ends its life cycle at either [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCommandBufferStatus\/completed] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCommandBufferStatus\/error].",
