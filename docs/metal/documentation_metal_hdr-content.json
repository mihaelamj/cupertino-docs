Certain displays, which macOS refers to as extended dynamic range (EDR) displays, can physically replicate those extra brightness values on a screen. You can use Metal to detect EDR displays and work with HDR content, such as from a video asset or directly from your app.\n\n## High dynamic range content\n\n- **Processing HDR images with Metal**: Implement a post-processing pipeline using the latest features on Apple GPUs.\n- **Displaying HDR content in a Metal layer**: Bring your high dynamic range (HDR) content to compatible Mac displays.\n- **Determining support for EDR values**: Check whether a display supports EDR.\n- **Using color spaces to display HDR content**: Use a color space when you don’t need to edit or process the pixel data.\n- **Using system tone mapping on video content**: Use EDR metadata to apply the default system tone mapping to a layer.\n- **Performing your own tone mapping**: Apply your own tone mapping to get the exact behavior you want.\n- **Implementing tone mapping on reference displays**: Detect reference displays and keep your content within the capabilities of the display hardware.\n\n## Presentation\n\n- **Managing your game window for Metal in macOS**: Set up a window and view for optimally displaying your Metal content.\n- **Managing your Metal app window in iPadOS**: Set up a window that handles dynamically resizing your Metal content.\n- **Adapting your game interface for smaller screens**: Make text legible on all devices the player chooses to run your game on.\n- **Onscreen presentation**: Show the output from a GPU’s rendering pass to the user in your app.\n\n",
