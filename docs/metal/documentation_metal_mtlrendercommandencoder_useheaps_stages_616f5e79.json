Call the method before encoding draw calls that may access resources within `heaps` through an argument buffer. The method ensures each resource is in a format that’s compatible with the shaders that depend on it.\n\nThe method’s applies the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLResourceUsage\/read] resource usage option to all of the resources within `heaps`, except for textures. The method ignores any texture that has [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLTextureUsage\/renderTarget], [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLTextureUsage\/shaderWrite], or both in its [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLTexture\/usage] property. For all other textures in `heaps`, the method optimizes each texture’s memory layout for rendering with a sampler. However, your shaders can’t read from those textures by calling this method because the texture needs a different memory layout that’s suitable for reading.\n\nMethods that apply a usage option for resources (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/argument-buffer-resource-preparation-commands]) override any previous calls that apply to a resource. For example, you can change the usage option for a buffer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLResourceUsage\/write] by passing it to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderCommandEncoder\/useResource(_:usage:stages:)] after calling this method. However, you can’t reverse the call order because this method resets the usage for all resources within `heaps` to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLResourceUsage\/read], overriding previous calls to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderCommandEncoder\/useResource(_:usage:stages:)].\n\nThe method instructs Metal to apply hazard tracking for resources you allocate from a heap that you create with [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLHazardTrackingMode\/tracked].
