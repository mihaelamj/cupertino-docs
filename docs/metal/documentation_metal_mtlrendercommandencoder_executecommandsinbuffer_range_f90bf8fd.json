When running on Metal devices that belong to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLGPUFamily\/mac2] GPU family, the number of commands needs to be less than or equal to 0x4000 (16,384). Metal devices that belong to an Apple silicon family, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLGPUFamily\/apple10], don’t have this limitation.\n\n## Running commands from indirect command buffers\n\n- **executeCommandsInBuffer(_:indirectBuffer:offset:)**: Encodes a command that runs an indirect range of commands from an indirect command buffer (ICB).\n\n",
