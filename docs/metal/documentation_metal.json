See the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/metal\/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf] for shader implementation details.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Understanding the Metal 4 core API**: Discover the features and functionality in the Metal 4 foundational APIs.\n- **Drawing a triangle with Metal 4**: Render a colorful, rotating 2D triangle by running draw commands with a render pipeline on a GPU.\n- **Performing calculations on a GPU**: Use Metal to find GPUs and perform calculations on them.\n- **Using Metal to draw a view’s contents**: Create a MetalKit view and a render pass to draw the view’s contents.\n\n## Samples\n\n- **Metal sample code library**: Explore the complete set of Metal samples.\n\n## GPU devices\n\n- **GPU devices and work submission**: Find any available GPU, submit work to it with command buffers, suspend work, and coordinate between multiple GPUs.\n\n## Command encoders\n\n- **Render passes**: Encode a render pass to draw graphics into an image.\n- **Compute passes**: Encode a compute pass that runs computations in parallel on a thread grid, processing and manipulating Metal resource data on multiple cores of a GPU.\n- **Machine-learning passes**: Add machine-learning model inference to your Metal app’s GPU workflow.\n- **Blit passes**: Encode a block information transfer pass to adjust and copy data to and from GPU resources, such as buffers and textures.\n- **Indirect command encoding**: Store draw commands in Metal buffers and run them at a later time on the GPU, either once or repeatedly.\n- **Ray tracing with acceleration structures**: Build a representation of your scene’s geometry using triangles and bounding volumes to quickly trace rays through the scene.\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Resource fundamentals**: Control the common attributes of all Metal memory resources, including buffers and textures, and how to configure their underlying memory.\n- **Buffers**: Create and manage untyped data your app uses to exchange information with its shader functions.\n- **Textures**: Create and manage typed data your app uses to exchange information with its shader functions.\n- **Memory heaps**: Take control of your app’s GPU memory management by creating a large memory allocation for various buffers, textures, and other resources.\n- **Resource loading**: Load assets in your games and apps quickly by running a dedicated input\/output queue alongside your GPU tasks.\n- **Resource synchronization**: Prevent multiple commands that can access the same resources simultaneously by coordinating those reads and writes with barriers, fences, or events.\n\n## Shader compilation and libraries\n\n- **Using the Metal 4 compilation API**: Control when and how you compile an app’s shaders.\n- **Shader libraries**: Manage and load your app’s Metal shaders.\n- **Using function specialization to build pipeline variants**: Create pipelines for different levels of detail from a common shader source.\n\n## Presentation\n\n- **Managing your game window for Metal in macOS**: Set up a window and view for optimally displaying your Metal content.\n- **Managing your Metal app window in iPadOS**: Set up a window that handles dynamically resizing your Metal content.\n- **Adapting your game interface for smaller screens**: Make text legible on all devices the player chooses to run your game on.\n- **Onscreen presentation**: Show the output from a GPU’s rendering pass to the user in your app.\n- **HDR content**: Take advantage of high dynamic range to present more vibrant colors in your apps and games.\n\n## Developer tools\n\n- **Supporting Simulator in a Metal app**: Configure alternative render paths in your Metal app to enable running your app in Simulator.\n- **Capturing Metal commands programmatically**: Invoke a Metal frame capture from your app, then save the resulting GPU trace to a file or view it in Xcode.\n- **Logging shader debug messages**: Print debugging messages that a shader generates using shader logging.\n- **Developing Metal apps that run in Simulator**: Prototype and test your Metal apps in Simulator.\n- **Improving your game’s graphics performance and settings**: Fix performance glitches and develop default settings for smooth experiences on Apple platforms using the powerful suite of Metal development tools.\n- **Metal debugger**: Debug and profile your Metal workload with a GPU trace.\n- **Metal developer workflows**: Locate and fix issues related to your app’s use of the Metal API and GPU functions.\n- **GPU counters and counter sample buffers**: Retrieve runtime data from a GPU device by sampling one or more of its counters.\n- **Metal debugging types**: Create capture managers and capture scopes, and review a GPU device’s log after it runs a command buffer.\n\n## Apple silicon\n\n- **Porting your Metal code to Apple silicon**: Create a version of your Metal app that runs on both Apple silicon and Intel-based Mac computers.\n- **Tailor your apps for Apple GPUs and tile-based deferred rendering**: Learn about characteristic Apple GPU features, including imageblocks, tile shaders, and raster order groups.\n\n## Reference\n\n- **Metal structures**\n- **Metal enumerations**\n- **Metal constants**\n- **Metal data types**\n- **Metal variables**\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Metal Programming Guide**\n-
