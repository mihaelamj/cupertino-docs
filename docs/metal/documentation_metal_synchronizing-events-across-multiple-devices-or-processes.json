  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe following figure and code show a shareable event that synchronizes graphics rendering on one device with compute processing on another.\n\n\n\nDuring setup, the code creates a shareable event ([doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLSharedEvent]) and command queues on two different devices. Like the example shown in [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/synchronizing-events-within-a-single-device], it encodes render commands onto the first queue and compute commands on the second queue.\n\nYou call the same methods when signaling and waiting on shared events as you do when working with events on a single device. The only difference is that the queues are associated with different devices and the event being used to synchronize access is a shared event.\n\nThe code shown above assumes you’ve created each resource on both device objects, and each pair of resources share a single allocation of memory. This strategy means that change made by one device object are visible to the other device object. For an example of how to do this, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/selecting-device-objects-for-compute-processing].",
