Call the method before encoding draw calls that may access `resource` through an argument buffer. The method ensures the resource is in a format that’s compatible with the shaders that depend on it.\n\nFor example, you can explicitly bind resources for the vertex stage with the methods in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/vertex-shader-resource-preparation-commands] collection.\n\nThe method also informs Metal when to apply hazard tracking for a resource you create with [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLHazardTrackingMode\/tracked]. For a resource you create with [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLHazardTrackingMode\/untracked], you need to apply an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLFence] or an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLEvent] to account for potential reading and writing hazards.\n\nYou can reconfigure an individual resource’s `usage` options for subsequent draw calls in the same render pass by calling this method again.\n\nApps typically call the method for a resource in an argument buffer as a part of their *bindless* implementation.
