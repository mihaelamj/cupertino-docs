By contrast, the default capture scope records all the data for a single frame when you click the Capture GPU workload button in the debug bar in Xcode. You can choose which data Metal records during a frame capture by creating your own capture scope.\n\nYou can program exactly which Metal commands to record in a frame capture by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCaptureScope\/begin()] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCaptureScope\/end()] methods around the Metal calls you want the capture to include. In the case of a rendering loop, your calls to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCaptureScope\/begin()] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLCaptureScope\/end()] can capture a small part of a frame, or capture data from multiple frames.\n\nFor more information about frame captures and capture scopes, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/Metal-debugger] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/Metal-developer-workflows], respectively.",
