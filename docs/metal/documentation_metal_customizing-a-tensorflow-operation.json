Follow the instructions in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/metal\/tensorflow-plugin\/].\n2. Install ffmpeg using `brew`.\n\n```\nbrew install ffmpeg\n```\n3. Install the required Python packages.\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n4. Use `make` to build the custom operation with Xcode.\n\n```\ncd hash_encoder\nmake\ncd ..\n```\n5. Run the sample.\n\n```\npython tiny_nerf_hash.py\n```\n6. View the resutls in the `result_nerf_hash` folder.\n\n- To compare the performance benefits provided by this sample, you can run the original NeRF sample code included with the project.  View the resutls in the `result_nerf_mlp` folder.\n\n```\npython tiny_nerf_mlp.py\n```\n\n\n\n## Compute workflows\n\n- **Performing calculations on a GPU**: Use Metal to find GPUs and perform calculations on them.\n- **Selecting device objects for compute processing**: Switch dynamically between multiple GPUs to efficiently execute a compute-intensive simulation.\n- **Customizing a PyTorch operation**: Implement a custom operation in PyTorch that uses Metal kernels to improve performance.\n\n",
