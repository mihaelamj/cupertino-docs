Your shader can use that value to identify which instance the vertex belongs to.\n\nFor more information about the `instance_id` argument attribute for vertex shaders, see the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/metal\/Metal-Shading-Language-Specification.pdf].\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe method records the encoder’s current rendering state and resources the command needs as it runs.
