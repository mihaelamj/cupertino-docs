Call the method before encoding draw calls that may access resources within the `heaps` through an argument buffer. The method ensures each resource is in a format that’s compatible with the kernels that depend on it.\n\nThis method applies the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLResourceUsage\/read] resource usage option to all of the resources within `heap`, except for textures. The method ignores any texture that has [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLTextureUsage\/renderTarget], [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLTextureUsage\/shaderWrite], or both in its [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLTexture\/usage] property. For all other textures in `heap`, the method optimizes each texture’s memory layout for rendering with a sampler. However, your kernels can’t read from those textures by calling this method because the texture needs a different memory layout that’s suitable for reading.\n\nMethods that apply a usage option for resources (see Encoding Resident Resources) override any previous calls that apply to a resource. For example, you can change the usage option for a buffer allocated in `heap` to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLResourceUsage\/write] by passing it to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLComputeCommandEncoder\/useResources(_:usage:)] after calling this method. However, you can’t reverse the call order because this method resets the usage for all resources within `heap` to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLResourceUsage\/read], overriding previous calls to [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLComputeCommandEncoder\/useResource(_:usage:)].\n\nThis method instructs Metal to apply hazard tracking for resources you allocate from a heap that you create with [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLHazardTrackingMode\/tracked]. However, for untracked resources — which come from heaps you create with [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLHazardTrackingMode\/untracked] — you need to account for hazards by applying [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLFence] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLEvent] instances.\n\nApps typically call the method for heaps that have resources in argument buffers for a *bindless* implementation.
