For the resources you create with [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLStorageMode\/managed], the CPU and GPU each have a copy of that resource. As the GPU modifies its copy, the CPU’s copy remains unchanged until you synchronize with a command, such as this one.\n\nThe CPU can access the updated content from its copy of the texture after the synchronization command completes.",
