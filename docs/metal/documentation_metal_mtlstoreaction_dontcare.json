You need to assume that GPU discarded the texture’s contents.\n\n## Store actions\n\n- **MTLStoreAction.store**: The GPU stores the rendered contents to the texture.\n- **MTLStoreAction.multisampleResolve**: The GPU resolves the multisampled data to one sample per pixel and stores the data to the resolve texture, discarding the multisample data afterwards.\n- **MTLStoreAction.storeAndMultisampleResolve**: The GPU stores the multisample data to the multisample texture, resolves the data to a sample per pixel, and stores the data to the resolve texture.\n- **MTLStoreAction.unknown**: The system selects a store action when it encodes the render pass.\n- **MTLStoreAction.customSampleDepthStore**: The GPU stores depth data in a sample-position–agnostic representation.\n\n",
