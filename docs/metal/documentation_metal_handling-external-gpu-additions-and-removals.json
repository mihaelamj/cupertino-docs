The following sequence of events occurs when a person properly adds and removes an external GPU from the system:\n\n1. A person physically connects an external GPU, macOS adds it to the system, and Metal makes the GPU available to your app.\n2. While the system has one or more external GPUs, macOS presents a menu bar icon that allows a person to safely disconnect any external GPU.\n3. A person safely disconnects an external GPU.\n4. Metal notifies your app of the request, and your app migrates all current and future work off of the external GPU.\n5. After all apps (including yours) have stopped using the external GPU, macOS notifies the user that it’s safe to disconnect the GPU.\n6. The system removes the external GPU so a person can physically disconnect the GPU from the Mac.\n\nYour app can support external GPUs effectively by responding to these events appropriately.\n\n\n\n### Set a GPU eject policy\n\nYou can control how your app responds to a safe disconnect request for an external GPU by configuring the `GPUEjectPolicy` key in your app’s `Info.plist`. You can assign the key to one of the following string values:\n\n\n\n\n\n### Set a GPU selection policy\n\nYou can control whether Metal prefers to use or avoid external GPUs by configuring the `GPUSelectionPolicy` key in your app’s `Info.plist`.
