  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen you copy data between resources, and the source or destination is a texture, specify which mipmaps that the data transfer affects.\n\n### Copy data from system memory to a mipmap\n\nWhen you copy data from system memory into a texture, using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLTexture\/replace(region:mipmapLevel:withBytes:bytesPerRow:)] or similar method, state which mipmap is the destination of that copy.\n\nCall this routine once for each mipmap you want to fill, changing the region to match the size of the mipmap level you’re writing to.\n\n### Copy mipmap data between Metal resources\n\nIf you already have data in Metal resources, use an [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLBlitCommandEncoder] to copy data to and from different mipmaps in a texture.\n\nTo copy all matching data between two textures, encode a command using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLBlitCommandEncoder\/copy(from:to:)]: method. The two textures need to have the same pixel format and type. Metal copies all matching mipmap sizes to the destination texture.\n\nTo copy a selection of mipmaps from one texture to another, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLBlitCommandEncoder\/copy(from:sourceSlice:sourceLevel:to:destinationSlice:destinationLevel:sliceCount:levelCount:)] method. Specify the first source mipmap level and first destination mipmap level, both of which need to have the same dimensions. Also specify the number of mipmap levels you want to copy.\n\nFor example, the following code assumes that the destination texture is twice as large in both dimensions as the source texture. Mipmap `1` in the destination matches the size of the source mipmap `0`, so the code passes `0` as the source level and `1` as the destination level. It also passes `5` as the level count to copy `5` mipmaps.\n\nIf you need to copy data between buffers and textures, encode a separate blit command for each mipmap level to copy. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLBlitCommandEncoder] for other methods that copy data to and from textures.",
