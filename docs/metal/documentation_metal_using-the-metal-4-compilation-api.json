  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nMetal 4 introduces a modular shader compilation API workflow that gives you more control over when, where, and how you compile your shaders. A major part of that workflow comes from a compiler protocol, which represents the compiler instances your app creates at runtime. The compiler protocol gives you the ability to monitor and control the shader compilation process.\n\nFor example, an app can use a compiler instance to reduce or eliminate runtime delays from compilation tasks, which can have an unpredictable duration at runtime, by deciding the best time to run those tasks. This reduction is useful for large-scale apps that have compilation tasks needing a non-trivial amount of time. You can build strategies that balance your app’s size and performance with the time it takes to compile shaders during development, your app’s runtime, or both.\n\n### Improve your app’s performance\n\nMetal 4 also introduces other shader compilation features that can improve your app’s performance by helping you only build the pipeline configurations it needs, including:\n\nYou can incrementally adopt the Metal 4 compilation workflow over time. For you example, you might start by integrating your app’s most critical pipelines with one or more dedicated compiler instances, and then iteratively migrate the remaining pipelines at convenient times.\n\nAs you convert more pipelines to Metal 4, you can increasingly leverage *harvesting* workflows, which are the techniques and APIs that capture, store, and reuse the pipeline states your app compiles. You can serialize a harvesting set into a binary archive, or to a pipeline script which you can precompile to a binary archive during development. Harvesting pipelines states can:\n\n### Create a dedicated compiler\n\nControl of the compilation process with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTL4Compiler] protocol, which provides direct, fine-grained control over shader compilation tasks. With Metal 4, your app can explicitly oversee more aspects of the compilation processes with a dedicated compiler instance, including the ability to:\n\nCompilation requests you run on that dispatch queue, such as with `dispatch_sync` or `dispatch_async`, run at the queue’s QoS. If the app runs a compilation directly, without using a dispatch queue, such as on the main thread, the framework runs the compilation on the same QoS as the app’s calling thread.\n\n### Choose synchronous or asynchronous compilation\n\nYou can compile your shaders synchronous or asynchronously. *Synchronous* calls block the caller’s thread until the compiler finishes, but *asynchronous* calls return immediately and finish running on a background thread or queue.\n\nSmaller projects or early prototypes typically compile their shaders with synchronous calls for simplicity because it’s easier to understand, implement, and avoid concurrency issues. But, compiling synchronously can affect the app’s runtime performance and responsiveness, especially when shader compilation tasks take more time.\n\nLarger projects, such as AAA games and professional graphics tools, typically compile their shaders with asynchronous calls because of their size and sensitivity to runtime performance. This approach avoids introducing long stalls that can impede high-priority tasks on the CPU, such as UI responsiveness, because you can choose a Quality-of-Service (QoS) level. Compiling asynchronously does add additional complexity because your app needs to manage the background work and synchronize it with foreground tasks.\n\n### Schedule compilation tasks\n\nThe schedule model in Metal 4 divides compilation work into different quality-of-service (QoS) levels, including [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQoS\/userInteractive] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQoS\/background] (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQoS]). You create one or more queues, each with their own QoS level, and then submit each compilation task to a queue with an appropriate QoS for that task.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTL4Compiler] protocol applies multithreading in macOS and iOS by default, which automatically scales to the hardware device it’s running on. However, iOS conserves energy and memory by applying limitations to background compilation threads. You can check how your app’s concurrency and memory consumption behaves by profiling your app on physical devices and tune how it applies multithreading and its QoS settings accordingly.\n\nThe system can help your app avoid compiler tasks blocking more critical tasks by raising or lowering a task’s priority based on your app’s needs. This approach solves scenarios that exhibit *priority inversion*, which is when a low-priority task indirectly blocks another task with a higher priority, by promoting the relevant, individual tasks on a lower-priority queue to a higher priority.\n\nFor example, if an app submits a task on a queue with a high QoS setting, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQoS\/userInitiated], but it’s waiting on another task already in flight on another queue with a lower QoS, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQoS\/background], the system automatically promotes the in-flight task to the higher QoS, including [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DispatchQoS\/userInitiated].\n\n### Save compile time and memory with flexible pipeline state properties\n\nStaring in Metal 4, you can reduce your app’s shader compilation time by defining and creating a generic, or *unspecialized*, pipeline state one time, such as at launch. After launch, your app can create multiple, task-specific *specialized* pipeline states from the the unspecialized state for each pair of a fragment shader with a vertex or mesh shader. For example, if your app creates multiple pipeline states that are mostly identical except for a few specific configuration details, you can create an unspecialized pipeline with these steps:\n\nWhen your app needs to create a pipeline state that replaces unspecialized values with specific ones, it can create one from the unspecialized pipeline state by:\n\nCreating specialized pipeline states from unspecialized pipeline ones can improve your app’s runtime performance because it doesn’t need to recompile the common code each time. The technique can also save memory at runtime, especially with shaders that have more code in their main body, because it doesn’t need to recreate common state or recompile the shader’s main body for each pipeline state specialization.\n\n### Improve GPU runtime performance with color-attachment mapping\n\nMetal 4 introduces the ability to modify the way a render pass maps its pipeline’s logical outputs to the specific, physical outputs on the GPU. This flexibility means you can create a render pipeline state that works with various render encoders, even if they each define their outputs differently. Instead of creating a series of nearly identical pipeline states that only differ by their output configurations, you can create a single pipeline state that *inherits* the logical-to-physical output mapping from each encoder you apply it to.

Configure the properties that vary across the various pipeline states to their unspecialized value, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLPixelFormat\/unspecialized] for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metal\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderPipelineColorAttachmentDescriptor\/pixelFormat] property.\n4.
