Use this framework to segment natural language text into paragraphs, sentences, or words, and tag information about those segments, such as part of speech, lexical class, lemma, script, and language.\n\n\n\nUse this framework to perform tasks like:\n\n- *Language identification*, automatically detecting the language of a piece of text.\n- *Tokenization*, breaking up a piece of text into linguistic units or tokens.\n- *Parts-of-speech tagging*, marking up individual words with their part of speech.\n- *Lemmatization*, deducing a word’s stem based on its morphological analysis.\n- *Named entity recognition*, identifying tokens as names of people, places, or organizations.\n\nYou can also use this framework with Create ML to train and deploy custom natural language models.
