The builder takes one input which provides information regarding the item being annotated such as its size.\n\n## Annotating marks\n\n- **annotation(position:alignment:spacing:content:)**: Annotates this mark or collection of marks with a view positioned relative to its bounds.\n- **annotation(position:alignment:spacing:content:)**: Annotates this mark or collection of marks with a view positioned relative to its bounds.\n- **annotation(position:alignment:spacing:overflowResolution:content:)**: Annotates this mark or collection of marks with a view positioned relative to its bounds.\n\n",
