  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nHelp people understand complex data by focusing on what you want to communicate and who you’re communicating to. For example, suppose that you have a collection of colorful toy shapes:\n\n\n\nYou can formulate questions about this data that you’d like to answer, like which toy shape appears the most, or how many toys are green? One way to represent your data is to collect it into a table. A table organizes the data into columns and rows so it can be easily inspected. For example, you can record how many shapes of each color you have:\n\nHowever, in many cases, a more effective data representation is a chart. A chart allows you to communicate large amounts of information all at once. The kind of chart that you create and the way you configure the chart depend on what you want to show. To create a chart with Swift Charts, define your data and initialize a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/Chart] view with marks and data properties. Then use modifiers to customize different components of the chart, like the legend, axes, and scale.\n\n### Define the data source\n\nThink about a chart as an answer to your questions. Suppose you want to know which toy shape appears the most. Start by visualizing how many of each shape you have. To display this information with a chart, create a `ToyShape` structure that represents the information that you want to visualize:\n\nThen, initialize an array of `ToyShape` structures to hold the data from the table:\n\nIn a real app, you might download this data from a network connection, or load it from a file.\n\n### Initialize a chart view and create marks\n\nCreate a [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/Chart] view that serves as a container for the data series that you want to draw:\n\nInside the chart, specify the graphical marks that represent the data. You can populate it with a variety of kinds of marks, like [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/BarMark], [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/PointMark] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/LineMark], that plot your data. The kind of mark that you choose depends on how you want to visualize the data. For example, you can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/LineMark] to create a line chart or [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/PointMark] to produce a scatter plot. In this case, creating a bar chart is a good way to convey the number of each type of toy shape, so you use [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/BarMark]:\n\nThe resulting chart clearly communicates that the cube toy shape appears the most:\n\n\n\nScale determines the position, height, and color of each `BarMark`. As you plot data on the y-dimension, the framework automatically generates axis labels for the y-axis to map the data values. The scale for the y-dimension is adjusted to match the range of totals for the shape’s group.\n\nThe above code lists each [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/BarMark] individually. However, for regular, repetitive data, you can use a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ForEach] structure to represent the same chart more concisely:\n\n### Explore additional data properties\n\nThe above bar chart shows how much of each type of toy shape there are, but the earlier table separates each toy shape by color as well. A stacked bar chart can visualize not only the amount of each toy shape type, but also the distribution of colors among the shapes. Before you can plot this new information, you need to represent color in your data structure:\n\nThen update the initialized data to include the color information:\n\nTo represent this additional dimension of information, add the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/ChartContent\/foregroundStyle(by:)] method to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Charts\/documentation\/Charts\/BarMark], and indicate the data’s color property as the plottable value:\n\nThe chart now splits the bars into different parts that represent the number of colors for each shape:\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart chooses colors to represent the new data, and adds a legend to indicate which color represents which kind of data.\n\n### Customize your chart\n\nFor many charts, the default configuration works well. However, in this case, the colors that the framework assigns to each mark don’t match the shape colors that they represent. You can customize the chart to override the default color scale by adding the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/chartForegroundStyleScale(_:)] chart modifier:\n\nNow the names of the colors match the colors used in the chart, making the chart easier to understand:\n\n\n\nThis chart makes the relationship between shape counts and colors clear. You can customize charts in many other ways. For example, you can set the bar width, choose different legend symbols, and control the axes.",
