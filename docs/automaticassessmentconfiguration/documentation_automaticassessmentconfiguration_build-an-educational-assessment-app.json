However, depending on the assessment, you might want to allow students to use one or more of these resources. Use the Automatic Assessment Configuration framework to enable assessment administrators to chose which of these system resources, if any, students can use during an assessment.\n\nThis app is a web browser, with a Lock and Unlock button to enter and exit from Assessment mode, and additional buttons that can configure and launch the participating Calculator and Dictionary apps with varying participant app configurations. These configurations are:\n\n- No access, where the participant app is prevented from launching\n- Allowed, with no network access, where the participant app can launch, but it can’t access the network\n- Allowed, with full network access, where the participant app can launch, and it has full network access\n\nYou can choose either Objective-C or Swift to build and run the same sample app.\n\n### Configure the Sample Code Project\n\nTo build and run this sample on your device, you must first select your development team for the project’s target using these steps:\n\n1. Change the sample project’s bundle ID to something unique.\n2. Make sure your team has been granted the  [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/bundleresources\/entitlements\/com_apple_developer_automatic-assessment-configuration] entitlement for macOS.\n3. Create an App ID with this capability on the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/resources\/certificates\/list]. Make sure the ID matches the bundle ID.\n4. Create a Provisioning Profile for Mac Development with the App ID you created.\n5. For the project’s target, choose your team from the Team menu in the Signing & Capabilities pane, and deselect the checkbox so Xcode won’t automatically manage code signing.\n6. In the Provisioning Profiles drop-down, chose to download profiles.\n\n### Start the Assessment Session\n\nBefore the app can start an assessment session, it needs to initialize the session.\n\n```objective-c\n\/\/ Start with an assessment configuration.\nAEAssessmentConfiguration *config = [[AEAssessmentConfiguration alloc] init];\n```\n\nThen the app configures one or more apps that the student is allowed to use during the assessment.
