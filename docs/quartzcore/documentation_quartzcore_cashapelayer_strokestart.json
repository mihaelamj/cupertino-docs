Animatable.\n- **fillRule**: The fill rule used when filling the shape’s path.\n- **lineCap**: Specifies the line cap style for the shape’s path.\n- **lineDashPattern**: The dash pattern applied to the shape’s path when stroked.\n- **lineDashPhase**: The dash phase applied to the shape’s path when stroked. Animatable.\n- **lineJoin**: Specifies the line join style for the shape’s path.\n- **lineWidth**: Specifies the line width of the shape’s path. Animatable.\n- **miterLimit**: The miter limit used when stroking the shape’s path. Animatable.\n- **strokeColor**: The color used to stroke the shape’s path.
