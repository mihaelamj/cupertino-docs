  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe dash pattern is specified as an array of `NSNumber` objects that specify the lengths of the painted segments and unpainted segments, respectively, of the dash pattern.\n\nFor example, passing an array with the values `[2,3]` sets a dash pattern that alternates between a 2-user-space-unit-long painted segment and a 3-user-space-unit-long unpainted segment. Passing the values `[10,5,5,5]` sets the pattern to a 10-unit painted segment, a 5-unit unpainted segment, a 5-unit painted segment, and a 5-unit unpainted segment.\n\nDefault is `nil`, a solid line.\n\nThe following code shows how how you can create three shape layers using the dash patterns described above. Each shape layer contains a simple path that describes a horizontal line.\n\nThe following figure shows three shape layers created with the code above. The top solid line has a `nil` [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartzcore\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/CAShapeLayer\/lineDashPattern], the middle has `[2,3]` and the bottom has `[10,5,5,5]`.\n\n",

Animatable.\n- **fillRule**: The fill rule used when filling the shape’s path.\n- **lineCap**: Specifies the line cap style for the shape’s path.\n- **lineDashPhase**: The dash phase applied to the shape’s path when stroked. Animatable.\n- **lineJoin**: Specifies the line join style for the shape’s path.\n- **lineWidth**: Specifies the line width of the shape’s path. Animatable.\n- **miterLimit**: The miter limit used when stroking the shape’s path. Animatable.\n- **strokeColor**: The color used to stroke the shape’s path. Animatable.\n- **strokeStart**: The relative location at which to begin stroking the path. Animatable.\n- **strokeEnd**: The relative location at which to stop stroking the path. Animatable.\n\n",
