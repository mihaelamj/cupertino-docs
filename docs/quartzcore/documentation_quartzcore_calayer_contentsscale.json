Higher scale factors indicate that each point in the layer is represented by more than one pixel at render time. For example, if the scale factor is `2.0` and the layer’s bounds are 50 x 50 points, the size of the bitmap used to present the layer’s content is 100 x 100 pixels.\n\nThe default value of this property is 1.0. For layers attached to a view, the view changes the scale factor automatically to a value that is appropriate for the current screen. For layers you create and manage yourself, you must set the value of this property yourself based on the resolution of the screen and the content you are providing. Core Animation uses the value you specify as a cue to determine how to render your content.",
