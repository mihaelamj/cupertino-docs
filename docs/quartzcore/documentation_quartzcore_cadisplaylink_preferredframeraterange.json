However, the system also takes into account the device’s hardware capabilities and the other tasks your game or app is running.\n\nThe system can change the available range of frame rates because it factors in system policies and a person’s preferences. For example, Low Power Mode, critical thermal state, and accessibility settings can affect the system’s frame rate.\n\nThe system typically provides a consistent frame rate by choosing one that’s a factor of the display’s maximum refresh rate. For example, a display link could invoke your callback 60 times per second for a display with a refresh rate of 60 hertz. However, the display link could invoke your callback less frequently, such as 30, 20, or 15 hertz, by setting a range with smaller values.\n\nSee [doc:\/\/com.apple.quartzcore\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/optimizing-promotion-refresh-rates-for-iphone-13-pro-and-ipad-pro] for more information.",
