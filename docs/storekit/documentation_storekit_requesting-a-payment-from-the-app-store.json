  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAfter you present your app’s store UI, users can make purchases from within your app. When the user chooses a product, your app creates and submits a payment request to the App Store.\n\nImplementing an in-app purchase flow consists of three stages. In the first stage, your app retrieves product information. Then your app requests payment when the user selects a product in your app’s store. Finally, your app delivers the products.\n\n\n\n### Create a payment request\n\nWhen the user selects a product to buy, create a payment request using the corresponding [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/SKProduct] object and set the quantity if needed, as the code below shows. The product object comes from the array of products that your app’s products request returns, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/fetching-product-information-from-the-app-store].\n\n### Submit a payment request\n\nSubmit your payment request to the App Store by adding it to the payment queue. If you add a payment object to the queue more than once, the system submits it to the App Store multiple times, charging the user and requiring your app to deliver the product each time.\n\nFor each payment request your app submits, it receives a corresponding transaction to process. For more information about transactions and the payment queue, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/processing-a-transaction].\n\nFor auto-renewable subscriptions, you may submit a payment request with a subscription offer for users you determine eligible to receive an offer. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/implementing-promotional-offers-in-your-app].",
