By entitling subscription access from your server, you can provide users the ability to access your subscription across multiple apps.\n\n### Create the Subscription for Each App\n\nTo get started, use App Store Connect to create a separate and equivalent [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/#\/dev06f89ce98] for each app that offers the multi-app subscription so that users can subscribe from any app. For design guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/in-app-purchase\/overview\/introduction\/].\n\nThe following image illustrates the steps for implementing a multi-app subscription:\n\n\n\n### Authenticate the User\n\nWhen providing auto-renewable subscription access across multiple apps, you must authenticate the user in a way that correlates across apps. Authenticating users using a login allows you to determine if the user has access to the content. To provide a consistent user experience, ensure that the login process is similar across your apps.\n\nTo provide an easy and secure login, take advantage of [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/sign-in-with-apple\/]. Sign in with Apple allows you to identify a user across your apps, while maintaining user privacy and protecting your app against fraud. You can store and retrieve user account data across your apps and the user’s devices, and use that data to unlock access appropriately.\n\n### Check Billing Status\n\nAfter authenticating the user, determine whether to grant access to the content based on their transaction history in the receipt.\n\nCheck if the user has purchased any subscription products before showing a subscription offer in the app. If there’s a subscription purchase from any app, verify if the subscription is active by looking at the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/releasenotes\/General\/ValidateAppStoreReceipt\/Chapters\/ReceiptFields.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40010573-CH106-SW28] in the receipt.\n\nPresent users who don’t have an active subscription with the subscription for purchase. Consider all potential billing scenarios within your account database when determining eligibility and granting access to a user.\n\n### Validate Subscription Status\n\nA user’s subscription status can change any time. Validate the receipt and check the latest [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/releasenotes\/General\/ValidateAppStoreReceipt\/Chapters\/ReceiptFields.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40010573-CH106-SW28] to maintain the billing status for each user and reflect any changes.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/enabling-app-store-server-notifications] keeps your server aware of changes made to a customer’s subscription status. Update your records to keep users’ subscription status and content current. The billing status must be accurate in your account database to provide the expected user experience across all apps.\n\n### Enable Access to Purchased Content\n\nAfter determining that the user should have access, you can enable access in each app based on the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/releasenotes\/General\/ValidateAppStoreReceipt\/Chapters\/ReceiptFields.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40010573-CH106-SW28].
