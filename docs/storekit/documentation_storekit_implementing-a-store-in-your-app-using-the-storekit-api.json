It defines In-App Purchases in a `Products.storekit` file.\n\nTo test the sample in Xcode:\n\n1. Select the sample target, then configure it to use your Developer team for signing. For more information, see Assign the project to a team in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/preparing-your-app-for-distribution].\n2. Edit the SKDemo “Run” scheme, and select `Products.storekit` for StoreKit configuration. For more information, see Enable StoreKit Testing in Xcode in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode].\n3. Build and run the sample app on a device or in the Simulator.\n4. The sample app displays a list of products available for sale in `Products.storekit` upon launching. If the sample app fails to display an In-App Purchase, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Technotes\/tn3185-troubleshooting-in-app-purchases-availability-in-xcode].\n\n### Test the sample code project in the sandbox environment\n\nTo test your app in the sandbox environment, sign in to a Sandbox Apple Account. In the sandbox environment, you can test In-App Purchases using real product information from App Store Connect without incurring charges. This sample code project defines In-App Purchases in a `Products.plist` file. Before you can start testing the sample app in the sandbox environment, you need to complete configuration steps in App Store Connect and Xcode. For more information, see Prepare for sandbox testing in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/testing-in-app-purchases-with-sandbox].\n\nTo prepare this sample code project to run in the sandbox, perform the following steps in App Store Connect:\n\n1. Find or create an app that supports In-App Purchases and you can use for testing purposes.\n2. Select the app and make a note of its bundle ID.\n3. Create an In-App Purchase that uses a product identifier from `Products.plist`. Use information from `Products.storekit` to set up the In-App Purchase. Repeat this step for all identifiers in `Products.plist`.\n4. After you create the SKDemo+ subscription group, make note of its Group ID.\n5. Create a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/test-in-app-purchases\/create-a-sandbox-apple-account\/].\n\nTo prepare this sample code project to use information from App Store Connect, perform the following steps in Xcode:\n\n1. Select the sample target, then change the bundle ID to your testing app’s bundle ID. For more information, see Set the bundle ID in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/preparing-your-app-for-distribution].\n2. Configure the target to use your Developer team for signing. For more information, see Assign the project to a team in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/preparing-your-app-for-distribution].\n3. Edit the SKDemo “Run” scheme, and remove `Products.storekit` from StoreKit configuration. For more information, see Disable StoreKit Testing in Xcode in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode].\n4. In the `Server.swift` file, replace 3F19ED53 with your new SKDemo+ subscription Group ID from App Store Connect.\n\nYou’re now ready to test this sample in the sandbox environment. Sign in to the device with a Sandbox Apple Account, then build and run this sample in Xcode. The sample app displays a list of products available for sale in the App Store upon launching.
