You can install this profile on devices running iOS or iPadOS 14 or later.\n\nWith this profile, the installed app has five minutes to update the conversion value after initially registering. The device sends the postback within another five minutes after the rolling five-minute timer for conversion updates expires. Using this profile reduces the conversion value update and postback window from 24–48 hours to 5–10 minutes.\n\nThis testing profile expires two weeks after you install it on the device. To continue testing, download the latest profile and reinstall it.\n\n### Log in with an Apple Account to test ad attributions\n\nTo test ad attributions, you must log in to the device with a production Apple Account. SKAdNetwork doesn’t support Sandbox Apple Accounts.\n\n### Inspect postbacks using an HTTP proxy\n\nOn devices running iOS 14.7 and later with this profile installed, the system can send SKAdNetwork postbacks through an HTTP proxy that you configure. By using an HTTP proxy, you can monitor the HTTP traffic between your device and the network, including SKAdNetwork postbacks.\n\nTo configure the HTTP proxy, do the following on a testing device:\n\nWith the profile installed, the SKAdNetwork postbacks that the device sends now go through the proxy you configured.",

Select Manual to configure the Server, Port, and Authentication settings for your proxy, or select Automatic to provide a URL for your proxy.\n4. Tap Save.\n\nWith the profile installed, the SKAdNetwork postbacks that the device sends now go through the proxy you configured.\n\n## Testing ad attributions and postbacks\n\n- **Testing and validating ad impression signatures and postbacks for SKAdNetwork**: Validate your ad impressions and test your postbacks by creating unit tests using the StoreKit Test framework.\n\n",
