  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAuto-renewable subscriptions behave differently in the sandbox environment and the production environment.\n\nIn the sandbox environment, subscription renewals happen at an accelerated rate, and auto-renewable subscriptions renew up to 12 times after the initial purchase. This enables you to test how your app handles a subscription renewal, a subscription lapse, and a subscription history that includes gaps.\n\nYou can choose a subscription renewal speed for each Sandbox Apple Account in App Store Connect. For a complete list of subscription durations within the sandbox environment and more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/test-in-app-purchases\/manage-sandbox-apple-account-settings\/].\n\nThe accelerated expiration and renewal rates in the sandbox environment make it possible for subscriptions to expire before the system tries to renew them. When a subscription expires before the system tries to renew it, it results in a short lapse in the subscription period. These lapses are possible in production; verify that your app handles them appropriately.",
