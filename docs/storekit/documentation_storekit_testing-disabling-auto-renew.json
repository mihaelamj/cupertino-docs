In this test scenario, the customer cancels a subscription, which disables auto-renew.\n\nTo set up for this test, purchase an auto-renewable subscription for the Sandbox Apple Account.\n\n### Begin testing\n\nTo test disabling auto-renew:\n\n1. On the test iOS device, open Settings > Developer.\n2. In the Sandbox Account section, tap your highlighted Sandbox Apple Account, and tap Manage.\n3. In the sandbox Subscriptions page, select the subscription product that you want to cancel.\n4. Tap the Cancel Subscription button.\n\nVerify the change in the subscription status using either of these two methods:\n\n- If you’ve configured App Store Connect settings to receive App Store server notifications, your server receives the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/notification_type] `DID_CHANGE_RENEWAL_STATUS` each time the subscription’s auto-renew status changes. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/enabling-app-store-server-notifications].\n- Verify the receipt by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/Verify-Receipt] with the latest receipt. Check that the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/auto_renew_status] property of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/responseBody\/Pending_renewal_info-data.dictionary] object changes to `0`. The `auto_renew_status_change_date_ms` property of `responseBody` contains the timestamp of the change.\n\n### Test reenabling the subscription renewal\n\nAfter disabling auto-renew, reenable the subscription on the same Manage Subscriptions page by tapping the subscription and confirming payment.\n\nVerify the change in the subscription status using either of these two methods:\n\n- If you’ve configured App Store Connect settings to receive App Store server notifications, your server receives the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/notification_type] `DID_CHANGE_RENEWAL_STATUS` each time the subscription’s auto-renew status changes.
