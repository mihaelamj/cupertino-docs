Limited-time, discounted promotional offers can be effective in winning back lapsed subscribers or retaining current subscribers.\n\nBefore you can provide promotional offers in your app, you must first generate a subscription key and set up the offers in your App Store Connect account.\n\n### Generate a Private Key\n\nYou generate a private key in App Store Connect that you use on your server to sign promotional offers. This key allows Apple to authenticate and validate subscription requests.\n\nKeys don’t expire, and you can use them with any apps in your account. To get started, [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/#\/dev689c93225] in App Store Connect.\n\n#### Download and Store the Private Key\n\nOnce you’ve generated your subscription key, you’re given the opportunity to download the private half of the key. You can only download this key one time.\n\nThe keys are provided in base64-encoded PEM format. Apple doesn’t keep a copy of the private key.\n\nIf the key becomes lost or compromised, revoke it immediately and update your promotional offers. See [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/#\/dev689c93225?sub=dev4587a2b9c] for more information.\n\n### Configure Promotional Offers\n\nYou configure promotional offers in App Store Connect, providing details such as a reference name, payment mode, duration, and price.
