For example, you can promote an in-app purchase product that unlocks a specific level in your game when a user reaches the level immediately before the specified level.\n\nTo override the default product order, put the product information for the subset of products you want to reorder into an array, in the order you want them to appear in. Pass the array to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/SKProductStorePromotionController\/update(storePromotionOrder:completionHandler:)] method. The products in the array are shown at the beginning of the list, followed by the remaining in-app purchase products, which are listed in the same relative order that you set in App Store Connect.\n\nTo cancel order overrides, send an empty product array to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/SKProductStorePromotionController\/update(storePromotionOrder:completionHandler:)] method.
