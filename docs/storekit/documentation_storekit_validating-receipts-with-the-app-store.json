  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn App Store receipt is a binary encrypted file signed with an Apple certificate. To read the contents of the encrypted file, you need to pass it through the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/Verify-Receipt] endpoint. The endpoint’s response includes a readable JSON body. Communication with the App Store is structured as JSON dictionaries, as defined in RFC 4627. Binary data is Base64-encoded, as defined in RFC 4648. Validate receipts with the App Store through a secure server. For information on establishing a secure network connection with the App Store, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/preventing-insecure-network-connections].\n\n### Fetch the receipt data\n\nThe app receipt is always present in the production environment on devices running macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. The app receipt is also always present in TestFlight on devices running macOS. In the sandbox environment and in StoreKit Testing in Xcode, the app receipt is present only after the tester makes the first in-app purchase. If the app calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/SKReceiptRefreshRequest] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/SKPaymentQueue\/restoreCompletedTransactions()], the app receipt is present only if the app has at least one in-app purchase.\n\nTo retrieve the receipt data from the app on the device, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle\/appStoreReceiptURL] method of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle] to locate the app’s receipt, and encode the data in Base64. Send this Base64-encoded data to your server.\n\n### Send the receipt data to the App Store\n\nOn your server, create a JSON object with the `receipt-data`, `password`, and `exclude-old-transactions` keys detailed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/requestBody].\n\nSubmit this JSON object as the payload of an HTTP POST request. Use the test environment URL `https:\/\/sandbox.itunes.apple.com\/verifyReceipt` when testing your app in the sandbox and while your app is in review. Use the production URL `https:\/\/buy.itunes.apple.com\/verifyReceipt` when your app is live in the App Store. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/Verify-Receipt].\n\n### Parse the response\n\nThe App Store’s response payload is a JSON object that contains the keys and values detailed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/responseBody].\n\nThe `in_app` array contains the non-consumable, non-renewing subscription, and auto-renewable subscription items that the user previously purchased. Check the values in the response for these in-app purchase types to verify transactions as needed.\n\nFor auto-renewable subscription items, parse the response to get information about the currently active subscription period. When you validate the receipt for a subscription, `latest_receipt` contains the latest encoded receipt, which is the same as the value for `receipt-data` in the request, and `latest_receipt_info` contains all the transactions for the subscription, including the initial purchase and subsequent renewals, but not including any restores.\n\nYou can use these values to check whether an auto-renewable subscription has expired. Use these values along with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/expiration_intent] subscription field to get the reason for expiration.",
