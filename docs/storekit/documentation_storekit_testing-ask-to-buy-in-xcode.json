Then follow these steps in the StoreKit configuration editor:\n\n1. In the left pane, select Configuration Settings.\n2. Under the Purchase Options heading in the editor, enable Ask to Buy.\n\n### Test approving a purchase\n\nTo test approving a purchase, run your app in the Xcode environment and follow these steps:\n\n1. In your app, attempt to purchase the in-app purchase.\n2. When the Ask Permission dialog appears, select Ask.\n3. In the Xcode StoreKit transaction manager, notice that the Pending Approval purchase appears with a state of Pending Ask to Buy. In your code, verify the purchase state is [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/PurchaseResult\/pending].\n4. Control-click the transaction and select Approve.\n5. In the Xcode StoreKit transaction manager, verify that the state is now Ask to Buy Approved. In your code, verify the purchase state is [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/PurchaseResult\/success(_:)].\n6. Check that the app unlocks the content and finishes the transaction.\n\n### Test declining a purchase\n\nTo test declining a purchase, run your app in the Xcode environment and follow these steps:\n\n1. In your app, attempt to purchase the in-app purchase.\n2. When the Ask Permission dialog appears, select Ask.\n3. In the Xcode StoreKit transaction manager, notice that the Pending Approval purchase appears with a state of Pending Ask to Buy. In your code, verify the purchase state is [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/PurchaseResult\/pending].\n4. Control-click the transaction and select Decline.\n5. In the Xcode StoreKit transaction manager, verify that the state is now Ask to Buy Declined. Your app doesn’t receive a transaction because you declined Ask to Buy.\n\nFor more information about using the transaction manager, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/testing-in-app-purchases-with-storeKit-transaction-manager-in-code].\n\n### Reset or rerun the test\n\nYou can run the same test again without resetting state values. When you’re done, turn off Ask to Buy to prevent it from affecting future tests.\n\n## In-App Purchase Testing\n\n- **Testing at all stages of development with Xcode and the sandbox**: Verify your implementation of In-App Purchases by testing your code throughout its development.\n- **Testing In-App Purchases with sandbox**: Test your implementation of In-App Purchases using real product information and server-to-server transactions in the sandbox environment.\n- **Testing refund requests**: Test your app’s implementation of refund requests, and your app’s and server’s handling of approved and declined refunds.\n- **Testing win-back offers in Xcode**: Validate your app’s handling of win-back offers that you configure for the testing environment.\n\n",
