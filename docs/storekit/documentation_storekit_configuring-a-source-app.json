To participate in install validation, the source app needs to include ad network IDs in its `Info.plist` file. Ad networks are responsible for publishing or providing their ad network IDs to developers.\n\nOnly ads from ad networks that have an entry in the app’s `Info.plist` file are eligible for install validation. To work with multiple ad networks, include each of the ad network IDs in the source app’s `Info.plist` file, as follows:\n\n1. Select `Info.plist` in the Project navigator in Xcode.\n2. Click the Add button (+) beside a key in the property list editor and press Return.\n3. Type the key name [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/SKAdNetworkItems].\n4. Choose Array from the pop-up menu in the Type column.\n\nCreate an array that contains one dictionary for each allowed ad network, using the single key [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/SKAdNetworkItems\/SKAdNetworkIdentifier]. The string value for the key is the ad network ID.\n\n\n\nThe following example shows an array with two dictionaries that represent the example ad network IDs `example100.skadnetwork` and `example200.skadnetwork`:\n\n```xml\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier<\/key>\n        <string>example100.skadnetwork<\/string>\n    <\/dict>\n    <dict>   \n         <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier<\/key>\n         <string>example200.skadnetwork<\/string>\n    <\/dict>\n<\/array>\n```\n\nFor more information about property lists, see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev3f399a2a6].\n\n## Registering ad networks and configuring apps\n\n- **Registering an ad network**: Use the install-validation APIs for your ad campaigns after registering your ad network with Apple.\n- **Configuring an advertised app**: Prepare an advertised app to participate in ad campaigns.\n- **SKAdNetworkItems**: An array of dictionaries containing a list of ad network IDs.\n- **NSAdvertisingAttributionReportEndpoint**: The URL where Private Click Measurement and SKAdNetwork send attribution information.\n\n",
