As part of your test, make sure your app presents introductory offers only to users that are eligible for them.\n\nTo test introductory offers:\n\n1. Configure test accounts, as described in [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/#\/dev8b997bee1]. Create a variety of accounts that are eligible or ineligible for offers.\n2. Initiate in-app purchases from within the app for each test user.\n3. Verify that the user experience and pricing information dynamically represent the accurate price of your subscription.\n\nIntroductory offers are only offered once, but when testing your app, you can reset the status of the test account to allow you to redeem an introductory offer more than once. To reset offer eligibility for the sandbox account:\n\n1. On the test iOS device, open Settings > Apple Account > Media & Purchases (or iTunes & App Store for iOS 13 and earlier). Under the Sandbox Account section, tap your highlighted Sandbox Apple Account then tap Manage to open the sandbox Subscription Management page.\n2. Tap the expired subscription you want to reactivate. The subscription products that appear are those you configured in App Store Connect under the same subscription group.\n3. If the test account used an introductory offer, then the system diplays a Reset Eligibility button that lets you reset and redeem another introductory offer.\n\n\n\n## Introductory offers\n\n- **Implementing introductory offers in your app**: Offer introductory pricing for auto-renewable subscriptions to eligible users.\n- **SKProductDiscount**: The details of an introductory offer or a promotional offer for an auto-renewable subscription.\n\n",
