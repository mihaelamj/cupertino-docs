  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nImplementing an in-app purchase flow consists of three stages. In the first stage, your app retrieves product information. Then your app requests payment when the user selects a product in your app’s store. Finally, your app delivers the product.\n\n\n\nTo begin the purchase process, your app needs the product identifiers so it can retrieve information about the products from the App Store and present its store UI to the user. Every product you sell in your app has a unique product identifier. You provide this value in App Store Connect when you create a new in-app purchase product (see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/#\/devae49fb316] for more information). Your app uses these product identifiers to fetch information about products available for sale in the App Store, such as pricing, and to submit payment requests when users purchase those products.\n\nThere are several strategies for storing a list of product identifiers in your app, such as embedding them in the app bundle or storing them on your server. You can then retrieve the product identifiers by reading them locally in the app bundle or fetching them from your server. Choose the method that best serves your app’s needs.\n\n### Retrieve product IDs from the app bundle\n\nEmbed the product identifiers in your app bundle if:\n\nInclude a property list file in your app bundle containing an array of product identifiers, such as the following:\n\nTo get product identifiers from the property list, locate the file in the app bundle and read it.\n\n### Retrieve product IDs from your server\n\nStore the product identifiers on your server if:\n\nHost a JSON file on your server with the product identifiers. For example, the following JSON file contains three product IDs:\n\nTo get product identifiers from your server, fetch and read the JSON file.\n\nConsider versioning the JSON file so future versions of your app can change its structure without breaking older versions of your app. For example, you might name the file that uses the old structure `products_v1.json` and the file that uses a new structure `products_v2.json`. This is especially useful if your JSON file is more complex than the simple array in the example.\n\nTo ensure that your app remains responsive, use a background thread to download the JSON file and extract the list of product identifiers. To minimize the data that transfers, use standard HTTP caching mechanisms, such as the `Last-Modified` and `If-Modified-Since` headers.\n\nAfter loading all in-app product identifiers, pass them into the product information request to the App Store.

You can then retrieve the product identifiers by reading them locally in the app bundle or fetching them from your server. Choose the method that best serves your app’s needs.\n\n\n\n### Retrieve product IDs from the app bundle\n\nEmbed the product identifiers in your app bundle if:\n\n- Your app has a fixed list of in-app purchase products. For example, apps with an in-app purchase to remove ads or unlock functionality can embed the product identifier list in the app bundle.\n- You expect users to update the app to see new in-app purchase products.\n- The app or product doesn’t require a server.\n\nInclude a property list file in your app bundle containing an array of product identifiers, such as the following:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-\/\/Apple\/\/DTD PLIST 1.0\/\/EN\"\n \"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/DTDs\/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<array>\n    <string>com.example.level1<\/string>\n    <string>com.example.level2<\/string>\n    <string>com.example.rocket_car<\/string>\n<\/array>\n<\/plist>\n```\n\nTo get product identifiers from the property list, locate the file in the app bundle and read it.\n\n\n\n### Retrieve product IDs from your server\n\nStore the product identifiers on your server if:\n\n- You update the list of in-app products frequently, without updating your app. For example, games that support additional levels or characters can fetch the product identifiers list from your server.\n- The products consist of delivered content.\n- Your app or product requires a server.\n\nHost a JSON file on your server with the product identifiers. For example, the following JSON file contains three product IDs:\n\n```xml\n[\n    \"com.example.level1\",\n    \"com.example.level2\",\n    \"com.example.rocket_car\"\n]\n```\n\nTo get product identifiers from your server, fetch and read the JSON file.\n\n\n\nConsider versioning the JSON file so future versions of your app can change its structure without breaking older versions of your app. For example, you might name the file that uses the old structure `products_v1.json` and the file that uses a new structure `products_v2.json`. This is especially useful if your JSON file is more complex than the simple array in the example.\n\nTo ensure that your app remains responsive, use a background thread to download the JSON file and extract the list of product identifiers.
