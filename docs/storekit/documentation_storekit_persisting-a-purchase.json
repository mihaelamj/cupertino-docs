Your app uses that persistent record to continue making the product available on launch and to restore purchases. Your app’s persistence strategy depends on the type of products you sell:\n\n- For non-consumable products and auto-renewable subscriptions, use the app receipt as your persistent record. If the app receipt isn’t available, use the user defaults system or iCloud to keep a persistent record.\n- For non-renewing subscriptions, use iCloud or your own server to keep a persistent record.\n- For consumable products, your app updates its internal state to reflect the purchase. Ensure that the updated state is part of an object that supports state preservation (in iOS) or that you manually preserve the state across app launches (in iOS or macOS).\n\nWhen using the user defaults system or iCloud, your app can store a value, such as a number or Boolean value, or a copy of the transaction receipt. In macOS, users can edit the user defaults system using the `defaults` command. Storing a receipt requires more application logic, but protects the persistent record from tampering.\n\n\n\n### Persist purchases using the app receipt\n\nThe app receipt contains a record of the user’s purchases, cryptographically signed by Apple.
