You can determine when and where your app displays the prompt to request a review. Consider the best places and conditions in your app to show the request, and when it might be appropriate to delay it. Here are some best practices:\n\n- Make the request at a time that doesn’t interrupt what someone is trying to achieve in your app, for example, at the end of a sequence of events that they successfully complete.\n- Avoid showing a request for a review immediately when a user launches your app, even if it isn’t the first time it launches.\n- Avoid requesting a review as the result of a user action.\n\nAlso, remember that people can disable requests for reviews from *ever* appearing on their device.\n\n### Present the review request\n\nThis sample project demonstrates a simulated three-step process. A person taps the Start Process button, and then taps Continue Process twice, after which the app presents a Process Completed scene. The request for review appears from this scene only.\n\nIn addition, the app and its use meets the following conditions before displaying the prompt:\n\n- The app hasn’t shown a review prompt for a version of the app bundle that matches the current bundle version. This ensures that a person doesn’t receive a prompt to review the same version of an app multiple times.\n- The person successfully completes the three-step process at least four times. This number is arbitrary and developers can choose something that fits well with how many times someone is likely to complete a process in their apps.\n- A person must pause on the Process Completed scene for a few seconds. This requirement limits the possibility of the prompt interrupting them before they move to a different task in the app.\n\nTo present a review request, the app reads the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/requestReview] environment value to get an instance of `RequestReviewAction` and calls it as a function:\n\n```swift\n@Environment(\\.requestReview) private var requestReview\n```\n\nThe conditions above exist purely to delay the call to `requestReview`, so days, weeks, or even months can elapse without the app prompting a user for a review.\n\n```swift\n\/\/\/ Presents the rating and review request view after a two-second delay.\nprivate func presentReview() {\n    Task {\n        \/\/ Delay for two seconds to avoid interrupting the person using the app.\n        try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(2))\n        await requestReview()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTechniques to delay the call are valuable because they cause an app to show a review request when people are more experienced at using the app and can provide better feedback.\n\n```swift\n\/*\n    The lastVersionPromptedForReview property stores the version of the app that last prompts for a review.\n    The app presents the rating and review request view if the person completed the three-step process at least four times and\n    its current version is different from the version that last prompted them for review.\n*\/\nif processCompletedCount >= 4, currentAppVersion != lastVersionPromptedForReview {\n    presentReview()\n        \n    \/\/ The app already displayed the rating and review request view.
