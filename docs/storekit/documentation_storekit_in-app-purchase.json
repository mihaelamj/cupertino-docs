  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWith the In-App Purchase API, you can offer customers the opportunity to purchase digital content and services in your app. Customers can make the purchases within your app, and find your promoted products on the App Store.\n\nThe StoreKit framework connects to the App Store on your app’s behalf to prompt for, and securely process, payments. The framework then notifies your app, making the transactions for In-App Purchases available to your app on all of the customer’s devices. For each transaction that represents a current purchase, your app delivers the purchased products. To validate purchases, you can verify transactions on your server, or rely on StoreKit’s verification.\n\n\n\nThe App Store can also communicate with your server. It notifies your server of transactions and auto-renewable subscription events through [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications], and provides the same transaction information, and more, through the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI].\n\nTo learn how adding In-App Purchases fits in an overall app development workflow for the App Store, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/pathway\/]. For an overview of In-App Purchases and its features, including its configuration, testing capabilities, marketing for your products, and more, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/in-app-purchase\/]. For an overview on subscriptions, including creating subscription groups, Family Sharing, and more, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/subscriptions\/].\n\n### Configure In-App Purchases\n\nTo use the In-App Purchase API, you first need to configure the products that your app merchandises.\n\nYou can also offer apps and In-App Purchases that run on multiple platforms as a single purchase. For more information on universal purchase, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/create-an-app-record\/add-platforms\/].\n\n### Support a store in your app\n\nThe In-App Purchase API takes advantage of Swift features like concurrency to simplify your In-App Purchase workflows, and SwiftUI to build stores with [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/storekit-views]. Use the API to manage access to content and subscriptions, receive App Store-signed transaction information, get the history of all In-App Purchase transactions, and more.\n\nThe In-App Purchase API offers:\n\nTo support a store in your app, implement the following functionality:",

For an overview on subscriptions, including creating subscription groups, Family Sharing, and more, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/subscriptions\/].\n\n### Configure In-App Purchases\n\nTo use the In-App Purchase API, you first need to configure the products that your app merchandises.\n\n- In the early stages of development, you can configure the products in the StoreKit configuration file in Xcode, and test your code without any dependency on App Store Connect. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode].\n- When you’re ready for sandbox testing and production, configure the products in App Store Connect. You can add or remove products and refine or reconfigure existing products as you develop your app. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/configure-in-app-purchase-settings\/overview-for-configuring-in-app-purchases].\n\nYou can also offer apps and In-App Purchases that run on multiple platforms as a single purchase. For more information on universal purchase, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/create-an-app-record\/add-platforms\/].\n\n### Support a store in your app\n\nThe In-App Purchase API takes advantage of Swift features like concurrency to simplify your In-App Purchase workflows, and SwiftUI to build stores with [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/storekit-views]. Use the API to manage access to content and subscriptions, receive App Store-signed transaction information, get the history of all In-App Purchase transactions, and more.\n\n\n\nThe In-App Purchase API offers:\n\n- Transaction information that’s App Store-signed in JSON Web Signature (JWS) format.\n- Transaction and subscription status information that’s simple to parse in your app.\n- An entitlements API, [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Transaction\/currentEntitlements], that simplifies determining entitlements to unlock content and services for your customers.\n\n\n\nTo support a store in your app, implement the following functionality:\n\n- Listen for transaction state changes using the transaction listener, [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Transaction\/updates], to provide up-to-date service and content while your app is running.\n- Use [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/storekit-views] to merchandise your products; or request products to display from the App Store with [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/products(for:)] and enable purchases using [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/purchase(options:)]. Unlock purchased content and services based on the purchase result, [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/PurchaseResult].\n- Iterate through a customer’s purchases anytime using the transaction sequence [doc:\/\/com.apple.storekit\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Transaction\/all], and unlock the purchased content and services.\n- Optionally, validate the signed transactions and signed subscription status information that you receive from the API.\n\n## In-App Purchase merchandising\n\n- **StoreKit views**: Display a customizable In-App Purchase store using StoreKit views
