After the change request completes, you can use the object placeholder to fetch the newly created object. You can also use an object placeholder to make additional change requests involving the object to create.\n\nFor example, the following code uses a placeholder to add a newly created asset to an album.\n\nA placeholder always has the same local identifier as the asset, collection, or collection list that it represents. To find the object that corresponds to a placeholder, read the placeholder’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHObject\/localIdentifier] property and use it to fetch the actual object. Alternatively, because the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHObjectPlaceholder] class implements the `==` and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObjectProtocol\/hash] methods in terms of its [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHObject\/localIdentifier] property, you can also find the object for a placeholder using techniques that depend on these methods.",
