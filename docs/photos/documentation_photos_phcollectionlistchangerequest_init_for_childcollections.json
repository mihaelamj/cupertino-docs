For details on change blocks, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary].\n\nUse this method when you need to insert, remove, or rearrange collections at specified indexes in the collection list. By passing in a fetch result reflecting what your app sees as the current state of the collection’s membership, the Photos framework can ensure that the indexes you specify are valid even if the collection has changed since you last fetched it. If you don’t need to work with indexes in the list of child collections, you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHCollectionListChangeRequest\/init(for:)] method instead.",
