In this case, Photos cannot automatically determine when the same objects are present in both fetch results but those objects’ content has changed, so the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHFetchResultChangeDetails\/changedIndexes] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHFetchResultChangeDetails\/changedObjects] properties are empty.\n\nHowever, you can use the `changedObjects` parameter to manually note objects as changed. For example, consider a view controller that maintains a base fetch result representing a list of albums, and a transient collection that filters the list according to the user’s search terms. For this workflow, you might use a method like the following:\n\nBecause transient collections are not stored in the photo library, Photos cannot provide change details for fetch results against a transient collection. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver\/photoLibraryDidChange(_:)] method provides change details for the base fetch result, which you can use to request change details for the filtered fetch result:\n\nBecause you provide the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHFetchResultChangeDetails\/changedObjects] array from the original change details when calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHFetchResultChangeDetails\/init(from:to:changedObjects:)] method, Photos can provide a summary of differences between the filtered fetch results that includes [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHFetchResultChangeDetails\/changedIndexes] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHFetchResultChangeDetails\/changedObjects] information.
