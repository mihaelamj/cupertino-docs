Photos also automatically marks members of the sequence as potential user favorites. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHAssetBurstSelectionType] for possible values.\n\nBecause an asset may have more than one selection type, you use bit masks to identify an asset. For example, the code below tests an asset’s selection type.",
