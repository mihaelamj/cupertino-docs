The source samples of the image mask determine which points of the clipping area are changed, acting as an “inverse alpha” value. If the value of a source sample in the image mask is `S`, then the corresponding point in the current clipping area is multiplied by an alpha value of (`1–S`). For example, if `S` is `1` then the point in the clipping area becomes transparent. If `S` is `0`, the point in the clipping area is unchanged.\n\nIf the `mask` parameter is an image, then `mask` acts like an alpha mask and is blended with the current clipping area. The source samples of mask determine which points of the clipping area are changed. If the value of the source sample in mask is `S`, then the corresponding point in the current clipping area is multiplied by an alpha of `S`.
