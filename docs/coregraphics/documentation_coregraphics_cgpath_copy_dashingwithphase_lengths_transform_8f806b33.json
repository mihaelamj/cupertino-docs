For example, a value of `0` draws a line starting with the beginning of a dash pattern, and a value of `3` means the line is drawn with the dash pattern starting at three units from its beginning.\n- **lengths**: An array of values that specify the lengths, in user space coordinates, of the painted and unpainted segments  of the dash pattern.\n\nFor example, the array `[2,3]` sets a dash pattern that alternates between a 2-unit-long painted segment and a 3-unit-long unpainted segment. The array `[1,3,4,2]` sets the pattern to a 1-unit painted segment, a 3-unit unpainted segment, a 4-unit painted segment, and a 2-unit unpainted segment.Pass an empty array to clear the dash pattern so that all stroke drawing in the context uses solid lines.\n- **transform**: An affine transform to apply to the path before dashing. Defaults to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coregraphics\/documentation\/CoreGraphics\/CGAffineTransformIdentity] transform if not specified.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new path.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe new path is created so that filling the new path draws the same pixels as stroking the original path with the specified dash parameters.\n\n## Copying a Graphics Path\n\n- **copy()**: Creates an immutable copy of a graphics path.\n- **copy(using:)**: Creates an immutable copy of a graphics path transformed by a transformation matrix.\n- **copy(strokingWithWidth:lineCap:lineJoin:miterLimit:transform:)**: Returns a new path equivalent to the results of drawing the path with a solid stroke.\n- **mutableCopy()**: Creates a mutable copy of an existing graphics path.\n- **mutableCopy(using:)**: Creates a mutable copy of a graphics path transformed by a transformation matrix.\n\n",
