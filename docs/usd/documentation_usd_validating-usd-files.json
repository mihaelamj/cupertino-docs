  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nDepending on the device, its operating system, and the app, there are three renderers that might display your 3D assets: RealityKit, SceneKit, or Storm. Each renderer supports a subset of the USD features. Use the tables below to determine which features are available. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.usd\/documentation\/USD\/creating-usd-files-for-apple-devices] for more information on how to determine which engine renders your USD asset. This article identifies feature support for assets imported from USD files. In some cases, the renderers might support features listed below, but do not support importing those features from USD files. In the case of Storm, feature support may differ from the open source version.\n\n## Review general and media features\n\nEach rendering engine supports a set of general and media attributes that cover fundamental features, such as which file types the renderer supports, and whether it supports *instancing*, which is a performance optimization where a renderer can inexpensively display a single asset multiple times in a scene.\n\nVariant support is handled differently between the three renderers:\n\n## Review geometry feature support\n\nUSD supports multiple ways to represent the shape of a 3D object, and has several features that affect the way these objects render.\n\nIf a renderer doesn’t support a feature that:\n\nAll three renderers support using attributes specified in the USD file, but RealityKit only supports Alembic and vertex colors on Reality Composer Pro, visionOS, visionOS Simulator, macOS 15, iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and later.\n\n## Review lighting support\n\nThe USD specification supports many kinds of lights, some that are well-suited to real-time use and others that are primarily intended for use in offline production tasks, such as rendering animations or special effects for movies, because they are computationally expensive. SceneKit and Storm don’t support USD light types that are too computationally expensive for real-time use. Because RealityKit is an AR-first renderer, it doesn’t use any lights included in a USD file, and instead bases its lighting on the scene’s real-world lighting.\n\n## Review physics support\n\nUSD supports many physics simulation features. Only the RealityKit renderer supports simulation features.\n\n## Review shader features\n\nThe USD specification includes a number of features for use by shaders and even includes a number of pre-defined shaders to ensure consistent rendering across platforms.\n\nMaterialX support is available on Reality Composer Pro, visionOS, visionOS Simulator, macOS 15, iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and later.\n\nTextures in the AVIF format are supported in visionOS 2.4, visionOS Simulator 2.4, macOS 15.4, iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4 and later.\n\nRealityKit has partial support for some shader features:\n\nIf no colorSpace or sourceColorSpace value is provided then the embedded image color profile is used when loading color textures.\n\n## Review skeletons\n\nSkeletal animation deforms a model based on a hierarchy of joints, which allows you to animate character assets and complex mechanical objects.",

Each renderer supports a subset of the USD features. Use the tables below to determine which features are available.

In the case of Storm, feature support may differ from the open source version.\n\n## Review general and media features\n\nEach rendering engine supports a set of general and media attributes that cover fundamental features, such as which file types the renderer supports, and whether it supports *instancing*, which is a performance optimization where a renderer can inexpensively display a single asset multiple times in a scene.\n\n\n\nVariant support is handled differently between the three renderers:\n\n- All three renderers support loading the active variant.\n- Storm supports changing the variant after loading the asset.\n- In Reality Composer Pro, RealityKit also supports changing the variant after loading the asset.\n- QuickLook allows you to change variants on the default prim after loading a USDZ asset.\n- RealityKit supports instancing of mesh and texture data from imported USD files.\n- RealityKit supports instancing, .usd, .usdc, .usda, visibility attribute, and variants starting with visionOS 2.0, Reality Composer Pro, macOS 15, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18.\n\n## Review geometry feature support\n\nUSD supports multiple ways to represent the shape of a 3D object, and has several features that affect the way these objects render.\n\nIf a renderer doesn’t support a feature that:\n\n- defines the shape of a 3D object, such as a NURBS patch (a mathematical description of a 3D surface), then the object doesn’t render at all. For example, assets defined using a NURBS patch render on Storm, but not on SceneKit or RealityKit.\n- modifies how an asset renders, the feature is just not used, but the object still displays. For example, an asset that uses subdivision surfaces (a feature that generates additional geometry on the fly) displays on all three renderers, but only generates the additional geometry when supported.\n\n\n\nAll three renderers support using attributes specified in the USD file, but RealityKit only supports Alembic and vertex colors on Reality Composer Pro, visionOS, visionOS Simulator, macOS 15, iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and later.\n\n- Primitive Shapes are basic geometry types such as cubes, cones, and spheres. The plane type is not supported.\n- Alembic supports requires files written using the Ogawa format. The Legacy HDF5 format is not supported.\n- The Preview purpose is used by all three renderers.\n- RealityKit supports subdivision on objects using a USD preview surface shader, starting with visionOS 2, macOS 15, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18. Objects with custom MaterialX materials use standard polygonal meshes.\n\n## Review lighting support\n\nThe USD specification supports many kinds of lights, some that are well-suited to real-time use and others that are primarily intended for use in offline production tasks, such as rendering animations or special effects for movies, because they are computationally expensive. SceneKit and Storm don’t support USD light types that are too computationally expensive for real-time use. Because RealityKit is an AR-first renderer, it doesn’t use any lights included in a USD file, and instead bases its lighting on the scene’s real-world lighting.\n\n\n\n## Review physics support\n\nUSD supports many physics simulation features. Only the RealityKit renderer supports simulation features.\n\n\n\n## Review shader features\n\nThe USD specification includes a number of features for use by shaders and even includes a number of pre-defined shaders to ensure consistent rendering across platforms.\n\n\n\nMaterialX support is available on Reality Composer Pro, visionOS, visionOS Simulator, macOS 15, iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and later.\n\nTextures in the AVIF format are supported in visionOS 2.4, visionOS Simulator 2.4, macOS 15.4, iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4 and later.\n\nRealityKit has partial support for some shader features:\n\n\n\nIf no colorSpace or sourceColorSpace value is provided then the embedded image color profile is used when loading color textures.\n\n## Review skeletons\n\nSkeletal animation deforms a model based on a hierarchy of joints, which allows you to animate character assets and complex mechanical objects.\n\n\n\n- RealityKit supports Blend Shapes starting with visionOS 2, macOS 15, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **OpenUSD schemas for AR**: Add augmented reality functionality to your 3D content using USD schemas.\n- **Schema definitions for third-party DCCs**: Update your local USD library to add interactive and augmented reality features.\n- **Creating USD files for Apple devices**: Generate 3D assets that render as expected.\n- **Placing a prim in the real world**: Anchor a prim to a real-world object that the runtime recognizes in the physical environment.\n- **Previewing a Model with AR Quick Look**: Display a model or scene that the user can move, scale, and share with others.\n\n",
