If the runtime finds a match, it places a prim at the image’s real-world location. When a runtime places a prim in the physical environment, the prim’s children also attach to that location.\n\nThe runtime employs the information contained in this property only when [doc:\/\/com.apple.usd\/documentation\/USD\/preliminary-anchoring-type] is `image`.\n\n### Declaration\n\n### Anchor a cube to an image\n\nThe following example demonstrates how an asset defines a reference image (`ImageReference`) that the runtime should look for in the physical environment. The asset includes a cube that assigns an [doc:\/\/com.apple.usd\/documentation\/USD\/preliminary-referenceimage] to its [doc:\/\/com.apple.usd\/documentation\/USD\/preliminary-imageanchoring-referenceimage] property, instructing the runtime to anchor it to a real-world object that matches the image criteria.",
