As a result, the anchorable child is effectively out of the parent’s hierarchy. Similarly, if an asset defines one or more anchorable prims layered beneath another anchorable prim, the runtime positions each prim independently. However, any unanchorable children of an anchorable prim remain positioned relative to their parent.\n\nSince the runtime doesn’t observe anchorable prim hierarchies, you need to define all anchorable prims at the root of the document, thus, without a parent.",
