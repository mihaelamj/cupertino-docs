When a USDZ file loads, the runtime displays the first active scene. The runtime ignores nested scenes. If an asset doesn’t define a scene, the runtime loads the full file contents as a single scene.\n\nDefine a scene using the `def` keyword to specify the asset’s active scene –– that is, the one that the runtime makes visible on load. Use the `over` keyword to specify inactive scenes –– those that are invisible on load. The runtime doesn’t display inactive scenes. The advantage of inactive scenes is that you can activate one in an editor during development, and an app can transition to an inactive scene during the AR experience.\n\nThis specification is backward compatible because of the way traditional USD runtimes skip `over` definitions. A runtime that doesn’t support the `sceneLibrary` metadata displays only the first active scene.\n\n### Declaration\n\n### Partition content into scenes\n\nThe following example demonstrates a scene template on which you can base your asset.\n\nUse the `sceneName` property to refer to a scene to load it or transition to it from another scene.",
