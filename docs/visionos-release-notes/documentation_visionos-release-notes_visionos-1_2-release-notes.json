For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 15.4, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-15_4-release-notes].\n\n### FaceTime\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Recent calls from an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch will not sync to Vision Pro and vice versa.  (125375528)\n\n### Keyboards\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Trying to access the emoji keyplane from the mini keyboard redirects the user to a letter keyplane with extra platter space.  (125951731)\n\n### Notifications\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Developers might see session interruption notifications that are not relevant to their app.  (125360716)\n\n**Workaround:** Developers should filter notifications against their audio session of choice like so: `NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: AVAudioSession.interruptionNotification, object: AVAudioSession.sharedInstance(), queue: nil) { ... }`\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: When testing a compatible iOS or iPadOS app on visionOS, the UI presented from the App Store review request APIs will now render correctly.
