The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 26.2, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 26.2, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-26_2-release-notes].\n\n### AirDrop\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Devices set to “Everyone” on 26.2 beta 1 are not discoverable by devices on 26.2 beta 2.  (163636875)\n\n**Workaround:** Update both devices to 26.2 beta 2 or ensure the devices have each other’s Apple account email or phone number in their Contacts.\n\n### Game Controller\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Include the new `GCUIEventTypeStylus` option in the bit-mask passed to `GCEventInteraction.handledEventTypes` (UIKit) or `.handlesGameControllerEvents(matching:)` (SwiftUI) if your application needs to handle input from Logitech Muse using the Game Controller framework.  By default, input from Logitech Muse is delivered to your application as UIKit or SwiftUI events.  (160811739)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The force values reported for the Logitech Muse tip and secondary buttons are not normalized.\n\nUse the `GCPhysicalInputExtents` object obtained from the `physicalExtents` property to inspect the range of measurable force values and to scale the normalized value into that range.  (159136834)\n\n### Instruments\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The Allocations instrument sometimes fails to report reference counting operations for native Swift types.  (163080666)\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/storekit\/appstore\/ageratingcode] API provides the current age rating code for your app. Use this property to fetch the age rating and compare it with the last known rating to check for changes.  (160960740)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: An issue prevents the purchase of a subscription using a win-back offer when testing with StoreKit Testing in Xcode.  (162357552) (FB20604848)\n- Fixed: `SubscriptionStatus.all` returning old `SubscriptionStatus` after a subscription change.  (163505178)\n\n### TV SharePlay\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Users are unable to SharePlay DRM content from the TV app.  (163515064)\n\n## visionOS 26\n\n- **visionOS 26.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **visionOS 26 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
