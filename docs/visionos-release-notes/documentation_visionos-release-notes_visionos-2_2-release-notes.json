The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 16.2, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 16.2, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-16_2-release-notes].\n\n### Compatible Apps\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- In the visionOS Simulator, iOS apps running against the “Apple Vision Pro (Designed for iPad)” target will crash upon launch if they link `ImagePlayground.framework`.  (141228566) (FB16079366)\n\n**Workaround:** Apps behave correctly when running on-device. Test directly against Apple Vision Pro hardware.\n\n### Mac Virtual Display\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Playing videos in Firefox does not work while using Mac Virtual Display with Vision Pro speakers.  (138642255)\n- Fixed: If you are not using the default Mac display resolution, the Mac Virtual Display window might get stuck when changing its aspect ratio.  (139087505)\n\n### Siri\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Siri does not work on the simulator.  (139096339)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Compiling in the Swift 6 language mode might cause an `@Entry` error due to “static property `defaultValue` is not concurrency-safe because non-‘Sendable’ type”.  (133885814)\n- Fixed: Views won’t accept dropped directories if [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/uniformtypeidentifiers\/uttype-swift.struct\/directory] or [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/uniformtypeidentifiers\/uttype-swift.struct\/fileurl] are not in the list of accepted content types for drop.  (138158126)\n\n### TabletopKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Direct manipulation allows a user to pick up equipment up close and move it in a way that naturally follows their hands.  (138592898)\n- Local handoff allows a user to hand off equipment from one hand to the other without releasing the equipment.  (138854913)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The existing API `tabletopGame(_ game, parent, automaticUpdate, interaction)` is erroneously annotated as `@available(visionOS, introduced: 2.2)`, which causes an existing app that uses it to stop compiling, unless the deployment target is bumped to visionOS 2.2.  (139018795)\n\n### Unity Applications\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Some Unity applications might render incorrectly. The content might swim more than expected and appear stretched.  (139384386)\n\n**Workaround:** Rebuild with Unity release 1.2.3 or later.\n\n## visionOS 2\n\n- **visionOS 2.6 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **visionOS 2.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **visionOS 2.4 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **visionOS 2.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **visionOS 2.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **visionOS 2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
