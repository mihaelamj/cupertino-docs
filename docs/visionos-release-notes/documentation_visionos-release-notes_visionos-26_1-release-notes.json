The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 26.1, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 26.1, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-26_1-release-notes].\n\n### Background Assets\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `AssetPackManager.url(for:)` unexpectedly throws an error when looking up the URL for a locally available asset file.  (157959878) (FB19512759)\n\n### Game Controller\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The time returned by `GCPressedStateInput.lastPressedStateTimestamp` is not in the correct time domain.  (159124910)\n\n### HealthKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- HealthKit authorization UI now displays a single Blood Pressure switch to control changes to Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure type authorizations. The API is unchanged and apps should request for both types in code.  (153579893)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `HKCorrelation` objects of type `.bloodPressure` fail to save with `errorInvalidArgument` HKError code if they don’t have exactly one systolic and one diastolic blood pressure quantity sample its set of objects.  (151889745)\n\n### Logitech Muse\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Logitech Muse might stop spatial tracking during usage, despite showing as connected in Settings.  (154905373)\n\n**Workaround:** Turn Bluetooth off and on, power cycle the Logitech Muse, and reboot Vision Pro.\n- Setting down Logitech Muse outside of Vision Pro’s field of view might cause Vision Pro to no longer receive pinch inputs from the hand that had been holding Muse.  (160816595)\n\n**Workaround:** Pick Muse back up and set it down within Vision Pro’s field of view.\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The `navigationLinkIndicatorVisibility` modifier crashes when run on iOS 17, iOS 18 and aligned releases.\n\nYou must recompile your app against the 26.1 SDK to receive this fix.
