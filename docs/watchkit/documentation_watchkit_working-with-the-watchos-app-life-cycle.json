Some of the most common transitions include when an app launches, goes to the background, or resumes.\n\nThe app launches when it isn’t running, and the user explicitly starts the app — for example tapping the app icon on the home screen.\n\n1. The app_ _transitions to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/inactive] state. The system calls the extension delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtensionDelegate\/applicationDidFinishLaunching()] method.\n2. The system instantiates the initial interface controller and calls its [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceController\/awake(withContext:)] method.\n3. The app transitions to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/active] state. The system calls the extension delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtensionDelegate\/applicationDidBecomeActive()] method.\n4. The system calls the initial interface controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceController\/willActivate()] method.\n5. *The app* appears onscreen. The system calls the initial interface controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceController\/didAppear()] method.\n\nThe app goes to the background when it’s running onscreen in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/active] state, and the user lowers their arm or the screen turns off. If the user explicitly closes the app, by pressing the digital crown or covering the screen, the app doesn’t become the frontmost app, and doesn’t remain in the inactive state, but transitions quickly to the background instead.\n\n1. *The system* calls the extension delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtensionDelegate\/applicationWillResignActive()] method.\n2. *The app* transitions to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/inactive] state. The app remains in this state as long as it’s the frontmost app (by default, 2 minutes).\n3. *The app* transitions to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/background] state. *The system* calls the extension delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtensionDelegate\/applicationDidEnterBackground()] method.\n4. *The system* calls the presented interface controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceController\/didDeactivate()] method.\n5. *The system* suspends the app.****\n\nThe app resumes when the app is running in the background, or is suspended, and the user activates the app, for example, by tapping its complication on the active watch face.\n\n1. If suspended but in memory, *the app* restarts in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/background] state.\n2. *The system* calls the extension delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtensionDelegate\/applicationWillEnterForeground()] method.\n3. *The app* transitions to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/active] state. *The system* calls the extension delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtensionDelegate\/applicationDidBecomeActive()] method.\n4. *The system* calls the initial interface controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceController\/willActivate()] method.\n\n### Receive background data\n\nWhen the system receives background data, it may not immediately wake the watchOS app to process that data.
