  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nBefore calling this method, you must enable your WatchKit extension’s Push Notification capability, as described in [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/devdfd3d04a1].\n\nCall this method to register a device with APNs. If registration succeeds, the system calls your app delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationDelegate\/didRegisterForRemoteNotifications(withDeviceToken:)] method and passes it a device token. Pass this token to the provider server you use to generate remote notifications for this device. If registration fails, the system calls your app delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationDelegate\/didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError(_:)] method instead.\n\nTo display alerts, play sounds, or perform other user-facing actions, you must also request authorization using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNUserNotificationCenter] class’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNUserNotificationCenter\/requestAuthorization(options:completionHandler:)] method. If you don’t request and receive authorization for your app’s interactions, the system delivers all remote notifications to your app silently.\n\nIf your watchOS app has an iOS companion, always send notifications to both watchOS and the paired iOS device. As long as the payloads are identical, the system recognizes the duplicates, and only displays one notification to the user.\n\nFor more information on setting up remote notifications, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/setting-up-a-remote-notification-server] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/registering-your-app-with-apns].",
