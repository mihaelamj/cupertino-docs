  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA long-press gesture is essentially a tap where the user’s finger remains on the screen for a minimum amount of time, which is configurable. You can configure the amount of time required for the long-press to be recognized and the maximum distance those touches are allowed to move before being disallowed.\n\nYou do not create instances of this class programmatically. Instead, add a long-press gesture recognizer to your Watch app’s storyboard file, dropping it onto a specific interface object. Touches occurring within the bounds of that interface object are tracked by the gesture recognizer and reported to an action method you define on the parent interface controller. For information on defining your action method and connecting it to your gesture recognizer, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKGestureRecognizer].\n\n### State Changes for a Long-Press Gesture\n\n\n\nA long-press gesture recognizer tracks touch events continuously, and therefore has many potential state changes. A long-press gesture transitions to the Began state when the touch event is first detected. After that, the gesture recognizer may transition to the Changed state, the Ended, state, the Failed state, or the Cancelled state. The two most common state transition sequences are as follows:\n\nThe Changed state is optional and may occur multiple times before the Ended, Failed, or Cancelled state is reached. The gesture recognizer calls its action method at each state transition. For more information on implementing continuous gesture recognizers, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKGestureRecognizer].\n\n### Interface Builder Attributes\n\nXcode lets you configure information about your gesture recognizer in your storyboard file. The following table lists the attributes you can configure in your storyboard and their meaning.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKGestureRecognizer] parent class also defines attributes that you can configure for your gesture recognizer. For information about those attributes, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKGestureRecognizer].",
