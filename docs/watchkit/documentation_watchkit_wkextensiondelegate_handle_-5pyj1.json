Use this method to update your app on Apple Watch so that the user can continue the activity from where they left off.\n\n### Handling Activities from SiriKit\n\nThis method is called whenever your app is launched to handle a SiriKit intent. Update your app’s user interface based on the `userActivity` parameter. Your app should seamlessly continue the interaction that began in Siri.\n\nBy default, the intent provides an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] object whose [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/interaction] property contains both the originating intent and your response. You can add additional, app-specific information by creating a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] object in your intent’s `confirm` or `handle` method, and adding your data to the activity’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/userInfo] dictionary.\n\nWhen continuing activities from SiriKit:\n\nIntents may launch your app under the following circumstances:",

Resume handling this intent in your app.\n- Avoid accidentally repeating actions (such as making double payments). For example, check the `INInteraction` object’s `intentResponse` property to see if the action has already been completed.\n\nIntents may launch your app under the following circumstances:\n\n- Some intents always launch the app after the intent is successfully handled (for example, intents with a `continueInApp` response code).\n- Your intent’s `handle` and `confirm` methods launch the app when you resolve the intent with a `failureRequiringAppLaunch` (or similar) response code.\n- The user can always decide to launch the app at any point in a Siri transaction.\n\n## Coordinating handoff activity\n\n- **handleUserActivity(_:)**: Responds to Handoff–related activity from complications and notifications.\n\n",
