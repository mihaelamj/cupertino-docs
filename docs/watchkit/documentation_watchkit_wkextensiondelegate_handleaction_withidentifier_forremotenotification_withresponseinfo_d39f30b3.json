If your containing iOS app supports interactive notifications, the `identifier` parameter may contain the action identifier of the button that was tapped. Use that value to perform the requested action. If the `identifier` parameter contains an empty string, that means the user launched your Watch app from the notification interface without choosing a specific action.\n\nThe system calls this method on your WatchKit extension’s main thread. The `super` implementation of this method does nothing.\n\nFor information about how to support interactive notifications in your iOS app, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/NetworkingInternet\/Conceptual\/RemoteNotificationsPG\/index.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008194].

The string is the identifier for an action that was registered by the companion iOS app; it identifies which button was tapped by the user. Use the identifier to perform the associated action. This parameter is set to the empty string when the user launches the app without tapping one of the action buttons.\n- **remoteNotification**: The push notification payload dictionary. This parameter contains the data sent with the push notification. For information about the contents of this dictionary, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/NetworkingInternet\/Conceptual\/RemoteNotificationsPG\/index.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008194].\n- **responseInfo**: The response information dictionary. This dictionary contains the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIUserNotificationActionResponseTypedTextKey] key with the text response selected by the user.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to handle actions selected by users from your notification interfaces.
