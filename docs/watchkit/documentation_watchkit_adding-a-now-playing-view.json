For example, users can play and pause music from their Apple Watch’s Music app or control the volume of a podcast on their iPhone.\n\nThe system automatically selects the source. If the user is listening to audio on their watch or phone, the system selects that audio source. Otherwise, the system selects the most recently used source.\n\n### Add the View to Your Storyboard\n\nTo add the Now Playing view, drag it from the Library to an empty interface controller in your WatchKit app’s storyboard.\n\n\n\nAlways present the Now Playing view so that it fills the screen in a nonscrolling container. Don’t add any other elements to this scene.\n\nThe Now Playing view uses your app’s tint color, but otherwise has no attributes or properties that you can set. In addition, no public interface class exists for the Now Playing view. This means you can’t access or control the view programmatically. Your app just presents the view; the system handles the rest.",
