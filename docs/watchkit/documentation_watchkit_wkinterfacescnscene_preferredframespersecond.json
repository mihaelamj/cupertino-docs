Choose a frame rate that your app can consistently maintain. The default value is 60 frames per second.\n\nTo provide a consistent frame rate, SceneKit usually selects a frame rate that is a factor of the hardware’s maximum refresh rate. For example, if Apple Watch’s maximum refresh rate is 60 frames per second, then that is also the highest frame rate used by SceneKit. However, if you ask for a lower frame rate, SceneKit might choose 30, 20, 15 or some other factor as the actual frame rate.",
