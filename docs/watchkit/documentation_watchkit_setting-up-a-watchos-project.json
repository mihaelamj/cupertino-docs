  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nBefore you start a new watchOS project, you need to decide how you’re going to distribute that project: as a watch-only app, or as a watchOS app with an iOS app. If your app is only available on Apple Watch, create a new watch-only project. If you want a watchOS and iOS app that deliver a related experience, either create a new project that bundles the two apps, or add a watchOS target to an existing iOS project.\n\n### Create a new project\n\nTo create a new watchOS project:\n\n\n\nXcode includes the Notification Scene by default. Leave this checkbox selected even if you don’t plan on implementing notifications right away. Selecting the checkbox adds the `PushNotificationPayload.apns` file to your project, which helps you debug your notification interfaces. If you add a Notification Scene later, you must also add the `PushNotificationPayload.apns` file.\n\n### Add a watchOS app target to an existing iOS project\n\nYou can add a watchOS target to an existing iOS project by following these steps:\n\n\n\nAs when creating a new project, Xcode includes the Notification Scene by default. Leave this checkbox selected even if you don’t plan to implement notifications right away; selecting the checkbox adds the `PushNotificationPayload.apns` file to your project, which helps you debug your notification interfaces. If you add a Notification Scene later, you must also add the `PushNotificationPayload.apns` file.\n\n### Understand the WatchKit app and WatchKit extension\n\nRegardless of whether you add a watchOS app to an existing project or create a new project that contains both an iOS and watchOS app, Xcode automatically configures the targets for your watchOS app and adds the needed files, as in [\/documentation\/watchkit\/setting_up_a_watchos_project#3295999].\n\nXcode divides the watchOS app into two sections:\n\n\n\nXcode sets the bundle IDs for both of the watch targets based on the container’s ID. For a watch-only app, this ID is the bundle ID for the root target. For a watchOS app with an iOS app, this ID is the iOS app’s bundle ID. The root of the WatchKit app and WatchKit extension’s bundle IDs must match the container’s bundle ID. If you change your iOS app’s bundle ID, you must update the other bundle IDs accordingly.\n\nWhen developing your watchOS app, edit your app’s storyboard in the WatchKit app, and write your app’s code in the WatchKit extension. Your WatchKit extension connects to controls and views in the storyboard using [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceObject] subclasses such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceButton] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceLabel]. These interface objects act as proxies for your storyboard elements. Use the interface elements to configure the elements in code.",

In Xcode, choose File > New > Project.\n2. Select the watchOS tab.\n3. To create a watch-only app, select “App” and click Next. To create a watchOS app bundled with an iOS app, select “iOS App with Watch App” and click Next.\n4. In the project options sheet ([\/documentation\/watchkit\/setting_up_a_watchos_project#3312778]), enter a product name for the project. If you plan to implement a custom notification, complication, or unit tests, select the appropriate checkboxes, and click Next.\n5. Select a location for the project, and click Create.\n\n\n\nXcode includes the Notification Scene by default.

Open your iOS app’s project in Xcode.\n2. Choose File > New > Target.\n3. Select the watchOS tab.\n4. Select “Watch App for iOS App” and click Next.\n5. In the target options sheet ([\/documentation\/watchkit\/setting_up_a_watchos_project#3312779]), enter a Product Name for the project. If you plan to implement notifications or complications, select the appropriate checkboxes, and click Finish.\n6. Xcode then asks you to activate the new scheme for your watch target. Click Activate.\n\n\n\nAs when creating a new project, Xcode includes the Notification Scene by default.
