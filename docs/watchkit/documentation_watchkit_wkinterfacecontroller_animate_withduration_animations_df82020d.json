If you specify a negative value or 0, the changes are made without animating them.\n- **animations**: A block containing the changes to make to objects in the interface. Use this block to change any animatable properties of your interface objects. The block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be `nil`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to animate changes to the following attributes of your interface objects:\n\n- alpha (opacity)\n- width and height\n- horizontal and vertical alignment\n- background or tint color\n- group content insets\n\nChanges to visible items are animated over the specified duration. If you call this method in an interface controller that is managing a glance or custom notification interface, the changes you make are applied without animations. You cannot animate changes to the content of an object.\n\n",
