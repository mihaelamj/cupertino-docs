These Items may consist of text, images, or a combination of the two. The user interacts with a picker by tapping it, using the crown to scroll through items, and tapping again to select an item. A single interface controller may contain multiple pickers, each with its own set of items.\n\nPickers can be configured to display items using one of several styles:\n\n- List. Displays a vertically stacked list of items. Each item contains a title and an optional accessory image. If you supply a content image, that image is displayed behind the title and accessory image. Multiple items may be onscreen at once and turning the crown navigates vertically through the list of items.\n- Stacked. Displays items as a stack of cards that animate in from the bottom of the picker. Each item in the list displays an image. Turning the crown animates the new card onscreen while animating the old card offscreen.\n- Image Sequence. Displays a single image from a sequence of images. Each item in the list represents the previous or next item in the sequence. Turning the crown displays the previous or next image in the sequence without animations.\n\nWhen the user selects a new value, WatchKit calls the picker’s action method to report that new value. The format of the picker’s action method is as follows:\n\n\n\nDeclare a method of this form in the interface controller class used to receive the picker’s new value. You can change the method name to anything you like. When configuring the picker in Xcode, connect its selector to your custom action method. The parameter represents the index of the item in the array of items you specified when calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfacePicker\/setItems(_:)] method.\n\nDo not subclass or create instances of this class yourself.

At that point, you can use the object in your outlet to make changes to the onscreen picker.\n\n### Interface Builder Configuration Options\n\nXcode lets you configure information about your picker interface object in your storyboard file. The following table lists the attributes you can configure and their meaning.\n\n\n\n## Managing the Picker Contents\n\n- **setItems(_:)**: Sets the list of items displayed by the picker.\n- **WKPickerItem**: A single item in a picker interface.\n- **setSelectedItemIndex(_:)**: Selects the specified item in the list.\n- **setCoordinatedAnimations(_:)**: Sets the interface objects that should coordinate their own animations with the picker.\n\n## Managing Input from the Digital Crown\n\n- **focus()**: Configures the picker to receive input from the Digital Crown.\n- **resignFocus()**: Removes focus from the picker, causing it to stop receiving input from the Digital Crown.\n\n## Enabling and Disabling the Picker\n\n- **setEnabled(_:)**: Enables or disables the picker.\n\n## Containers\n\n- **WKInterfaceGroup**: A container for one or more interface objects.\n- **WKInterfaceSeparator**: An interface object that displays a visual separator within a group.\n- **WKInterfaceTable**: An object that creates and manages the contents of a single-column table interface.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- WKInterfaceObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSObjectProtocol\n\n",
