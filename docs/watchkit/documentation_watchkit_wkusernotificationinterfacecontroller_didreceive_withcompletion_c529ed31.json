Implement this method and use it to store the notification dictionary, configure your custom notification interface, and execute the `completionHandler` block as quickly as possible. Failure to execute the completion handler in a timely manner will cause the system to display the corresponding static notification interface.\n\nWatchKit may call this method multiple times while your interface controller is active. If a new remote notification with the same category arrives while your notification interface is active, WatchKit calls the method again with the new remote notification payload.",
