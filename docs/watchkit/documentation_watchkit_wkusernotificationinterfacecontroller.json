  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nApps that support notifications can define one or more subclasses of [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKUserNotificationInterfaceController] and use them to implement their dynamic notification interfaces. For example, you might use a dynamic interface to display custom data from the notification payload or add related graphics.\n\nTo create the custom notification interface, add a notification interface controller to your storyboard. Interface Builder provides a static interface and you can add a dynamic interface as needed. Set the class of the dynamic interface controller to the name of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKUserNotificationInterfaceController] subclass.\n\nApps can include multiple notification interfaces in their storyboard file, and associate each interface with a different category. Categories define the purpose of an incoming notification and are custom to your app. In Interface Builder, specify the category information for each of your notification interfaces using the notification category object attached to the static notification interface controller. When sending notifications to a user, add the appropriate category string to the remote notification payload or set the string in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationContent\/categoryIdentifier] property of a local notification.\n\nAfter initializing your interface controller, WatchKit calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKUserNotificationInterfaceController\/didReceive(_:)] method to provide you with the payload data from the notification. Your implementations of those methods should update any interface objects and call the provided completion handler as quickly as possible. If you don’t call the completion handler in a timely manner, WatchKit displays your static notification interface instead.\n\n### Actionable Notifications\n\nFor each category your app supports, you can also register actions for that category. When a category has registered actions, WatchKit adds a button for each action to the corresponding static or dynamic notification interface. Because the system automatically adds the buttons, don’t manually add your own to your custom notification interface. For more information about registering actions, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/declaring-your-actionable-notification-types].\n\nWhen the user taps an action button, the system launches your app and calls your notification delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate\/userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)] method. The response parameter’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationResponse\/actionIdentifier] property contains the identifier for the selected action. Implement your delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate\/userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)] method to check this identifier, and then perform the corresponding task. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/handling-notifications-and-notification-related-actions].\n\nThe following rules define where the system handles the action:\n\n### Interface Builder Configuration Options\n\nXcode lets you configure information about your notification interface controller in your storyboard file.

For example, if you send a remote notification to the user’s iPhone and the system automatically forwards it to their Apple Watch, tapping the action runs it on the watch.\n- The system always handles background actions on the device that was the notification’s target.
