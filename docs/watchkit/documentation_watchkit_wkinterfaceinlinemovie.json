This object displayed a poster image for the video, and when the user tapped the poster image, the video was shown in a separate, full-screen, modal view.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKInterfaceInlineMovie] object also lets you display a poster image for your video; however, when the poster is tapped, this video replaces the poster image and plays in place. You can also create videos that play automatically as soon as the scene is presented.\n\nDo not subclass or create instances of this class yourself. Instead, define outlets in your interface controller class and connect them to the corresponding objects in your storyboard file. For example, to refer to a movie object in your interface, define a property with the following syntax in your interface controller class:\n\nDuring the initialization of your interface controller, WatchKit creates any needed inline movie objects and assigns them to their associated outlets. At that point, you can use those objects to make changes to the onscreen content.\n\nDo not attempt to play audio or video content while gathering heart rate data using Health Kit. If you use this class to play media, WatchKit automatically disables the gathering of heart rate data.\n\n### Supported Media Formats\n\nThe following table lists the encoding information to use when creating media files to play on a user’s Apple Watch. For audio and video assets played directly from your app, keep your clips relatively short. Short clips consume less space on disk, use less power, and take less time to download.\n\n### Interface Builder Configuration Options\n\nXcode lets you configure information about your inline movie interface object in your storyboard file. The following table lists the attributes you can configure and their meaning.",
