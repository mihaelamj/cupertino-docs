A value of `0.0` indicates that playback is paused while a value of `1.0` indicates playback is proceeding at the natural rate of the item. Rates other than `0.0` and `1.0` let you play the audio faster or slower than the natural rate of the item. Negative values let you play the audio in reverse.",
