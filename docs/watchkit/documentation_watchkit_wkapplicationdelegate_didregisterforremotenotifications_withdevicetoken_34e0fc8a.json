In your implementation, send the contents of the `deviceToken` parameter to the server you use to generate remote notifications. Never cache the device token locally on the user’s device. Device tokens can change periodically, so caching the value risks sending an invalid token to your server.\n\nTypically, the system calls this method only after you call your [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplication] object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplication\/registerForRemoteNotifications()] method, but WatchKit may call it under other rare circumstances. For example, WatchKit calls the method when the user launches an app after setting up the watch using a different device’s backup. In this case, the app doesn’t know the new device’s token until the user launches it.",

Send this token to the server that you use to generate remote notifications. Your server must pass this token unmodified back to APNs when sending notifications to this device.\n\nThe length of APNs device tokens can vary. Do not hardcode the token’s size in your app.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWatchKit calls this method after it successfully registers your app with APNs.
