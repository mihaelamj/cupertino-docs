When the user turns the crown, the picker updates the currently displayed image in each of the linked interface objects.\n\nThe animated images associated with the interface objects may have any number of frames. For each object, the picker determines the appropriate image to display based on the percentage offset from the beginning of the picker’s own item list. The first picker item displays the first image in the animated sequence and the last picker item displays the last item. If the picker has ten items and an animated image has 20 images, each new picker item advances the animated image by two frames.",
