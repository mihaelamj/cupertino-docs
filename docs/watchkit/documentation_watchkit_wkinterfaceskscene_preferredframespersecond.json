Choose a frame rate that your app can consistently maintain. The default value is 60 frames per second.\n\nTo provide a consistent frame rate, SpriteKit usually selects a frame rate that is a factor of the hardware’s maximum refresh rate. For example, if Apple Watch’s maximum refresh rate is 60 frames per second, then that is also the highest frame rate used by SpriteKit. However, if you ask for a lower frame rate, SpriteKit might choose 30, 20, 15 or some other factor as the actual frame rate.",
