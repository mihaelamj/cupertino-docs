For example, users can play and pause music from their Apple Watch’s Music app or control the volume of a podcast on their iPhone.\n\nThe system automatically selects the source. If the user is listening to audio on their watch or phone, the system selects that audio source. Otherwise, the system selects the most recently used source.\n\nAlways present the Now Playing view so that it fills the screen in a nonscrolling container. Don’t add any other elements to the view.",
