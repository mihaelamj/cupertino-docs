On Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Series 4 and earlier, the screen turns off when the app becomes inactive. On Apple Watch Series 5 and later, the system blurs the app’s user interface and displays the time over it.\n\n### Transition to an Inactive State\n\nWhether the screen is off or blurred, the app transitions to an inactive state. Its user interface is no longer shown, and it doesn’t receive actions from controls or gestures. However, the app is still in the foreground, and may respond to other events.\n\nAn app in this extended, inactive state is the frontmost app. The system can have at most one frontmost app at a time. When the user raises their wrist, the system automatically activates and displays the frontmost app. The frontmost app can perform the following tasks:\n\n### Respond to a Notification\n\nFor example, when the frontmost app receives a notification, the system calls your notification delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate\/userNotificationCenter(_:willPresent:withCompletionHandler:)] method, rather than displaying the notification alert. Your app can then respond by playing a haptic feedback or custom sound, and updating the user interface.\n\n### Transition to the Background\n\nBy default, the frontmost app remains in the foreground for two minutes before transitioning to the background and then becoming suspended. If the user dismisses the app (for example, by pressing the crown or by covering the screen), the app transitions immediately to the background, and doesn’t become the frontmost app.\n\nUsers can configure how long apps remain as the frontmost app using Settings > General > Wake Screen. The Return to Clock setting sets the default duration for all apps.\n\n\n\nUsers can also set a custom duration for a specific app by scrolling down to the list of apps and selecting the app to customize.\n\n\n\nWorkout, location, background audio, and audio-recording apps appear to behave similarly to the frontmost app. However, these apps continue to run in the background throughout the entire workout, location, or audio session. If the user navigates to the watch face during a session, the system displays a glyph at the top of the watch face. If the user taps the glyph, the associated app resumes running in the foreground.
