The system initializes the new interface controller with the specified context object and animates the transition asynchronously. During the transition, the currently visible interface controller’s content disappears from the screen and is replaced by the content of the new controller.\n\nAlways call this method from your WatchKit extension’s main thread.",

In your storyboard, the name of an interface controller is stored in the object’s Identifier property, which is located in the attributes inspector.\n- **context**: An object to pass to the new interface controller. Use the object in this parameter to communicate important information to the new interface controller, such as the data to display or any relevant state information. You may specify `nil` for this parameter if you want, but doing so is not recommended.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to perform a navigation-style transition to the specified interface controller. The system initializes the new interface controller with the specified context object and animates the transition asynchronously. During the transition, the currently visible interface controller’s content disappears from the screen and is replaced by the content of the new controller.\n\nAlways call this method from your WatchKit extension’s main thread.\n\n\n\n## Implementing a navigation interface\n\n- **pop()**: Pops the current interface controller from the screen.\n- **popToRootController()**: Pops all interface controllers except the app’s initial interface controller.\n\n",
