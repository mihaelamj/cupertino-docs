The type of feedback you specify defines the specific feedback that is delivered.\n\nThis method has no effect when called while your shared [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtension] object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtension\/applicationState] property is either [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/background] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.watchkit\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKApplicationState\/inactive]. By default, you cannot play haptic feedback in the background. The only exception are apps with an active workout session. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/HealthKit\/running-workout-sessions#Run-in-the-background] in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/HealthKit\/HKWorkoutSession].\n\nDo not call this method multiple times in quick succession. If the haptic engine is already engaged when you call this method, the system stops the current feedback and imposes a minimum delay of 100 milliseconds before engaging the engine to generate the new feedback. Use of the haptic engine also consumes power, and using the engine too much may create a noticeable drain on the Apple Watch battery, as well as a negative user experience.",
