  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThis function starts an interaction session between two devices.\n\nBefore calling this function, ensure the device supports the features your app requires by first inspecting global [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISession\/deviceCapabilities].\n\n### Restart an Interaction Session\n\nTo restart a session as the result of unpausing, call this function as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISession\/pause()]. The app calls this function when resuming from session suspension, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISessionDelegate\/sessionSuspensionEnded(_:)].\n\n### Prompt for User Approval\n\nThe framework prompts for user permission to provide its relative position to nearby peers when it calls this function the first time the app launches. On subsequent calls to this function, the framework consults a preference in Settings that stores the user’s decision. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/initiating-and-maintaining-a-session].",
