The app calls this function when resuming from session suspension, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISessionDelegate\/sessionSuspensionEnded(_:)].\n\n### Prompt for User Approval\n\nThe framework prompts for user permission to provide its relative position to nearby peers when it calls this function the first time the app launches. On subsequent calls to this function, the framework consults a preference in Settings that stores the user’s decision. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/initiating-and-maintaining-a-session].",
