  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse this class to interact with a third-party accessory that you partner with or develop.\n\nFor an example app that demonstrates this configuration, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/implementing-spatial-interactions-with-third-party-accessories].\n\n### Discover the accessory and create a configuration\n\nTo begin the interaction, your app discovers the nearby accessory using a technology you choose — like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreBluetooth], the local network, or a secure internet connection — and establishes a two-way data link.\n\nOver the data link, the accessory sends your app configuration data for this property’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NINearbyAccessoryConfiguration\/init(data:)] initializer. The accessory formats the data according to the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/nearby-interaction\/specification].\n\n### Enable background interaction for Bluetooth accessories\n\nIn iOS 16, third-party UWB accessories paired to the device through Bluetooth can interact with your app while it’s in the background. This enables a new class of hands-free experiences. For example, the user’s phone can be in their pocket and prompt an eBike to power on when mounted, or prompt lights to turn on and music to play as the user enters a room.\n\nTo enable background interaction:\n\n### Start a session and share configuration data\n\nTo start a session, the app creates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISession] instance and passes an instance of this class into the session’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISession\/run(_:)] function. After your app sets the session [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISession\/delegate], the system invokes the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISessionDelegate\/session(_:didGenerateShareableConfigurationData:for:)] callback and provides your device’s configuration data.\n\nOver the data link, your app sends your device’s configuration data to the accessory, which enables the two devices to start receiving location updates. When the system gathers location updates for the accessory, Nearby Interaction calls your delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISessionDelegate\/session(_:didUpdate:)] implementation. To match [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NINearbyObject\/distance-676dm] updates that your app receives through [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISessionDelegate\/session(_:didUpdate:)] with the accessory, compare the argument object’s discovery token with the value of this property’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NINearbyAccessoryConfiguration\/accessoryDiscoveryToken].\n\n### Enable Precision Finding for stationary objects\n\nIn iOS 16, you can combine the visual-spatial power of ARKit with the radio sensitivity of the Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to locate stationary nearby objects with considerable precision. To do that, set [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NINearbyAccessoryConfiguration\/isCameraAssistanceEnabled] to `true` and optionally provide the interaction session with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARSession] instance through [doc:\/\/com.apple.nearbyinteraction\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/NISession\/setARSession(_:)] before running the session. Together, the UWB chip and ARKit’s assistance enable Nearby Interaction to provide the same Precision Finding capabilities present in AirTag.",
