When running on paired devices, both the watch and iPhone must contain the U1 chip.\n\nTo run on paired devices:\n\n1. Select the WatchNIDemo target, then change the bundle ID to `<Your iOS app bundle ID>`. Select the right team to let Xcode automatically manage your provisioning profile.\n2. Repeat step 1 for the WatchKit app and WatchKit Extension target. The bundle IDs should be `<Your iOS app bundle ID>.watchkitapp` and `<Your iOS app bundle ID>.watchkitapp.watchkitextension` respectively.\n3. Next, for the WatchKit app target, select the Info tab, and change the value of `WKCompanionAppBundleIdentifier` key to `<Your iOS app bundle ID>`.\n4. Finally, open the `Info.plist` file of the WatchKit Extension target, navigate to `NSExtension` > `NSExtensionAttributes` > `WKAppBundleIdentifier` key, and change the value of the key to `<Your iOS app bundle ID>.watchkitapp`.\n\n",
