To participate in an interaction, devices in physical proximity run an app and share their position and device tokens that uniquely identify them. When the app runs in the foreground, Nearby Interaction notifies the interaction session of the peer’s location by reporting the peer’s direction and distance in meters.\n\nApple devices use the high-frequency capabilities of the UWB chip to share their positions in the physical environment and enable fluid, interactive sessions.

To participate in an interaction, devices in physical proximity run an app and share their position and device tokens that uniquely identify them.

For example:\n\n- A multiuser AR experience that places virtual water balloons in the hands of its participants\n- A taxi or rideshare app that employs a peer user’s direction in real time to identify the relative locations of a driver and a customer\n- A game app that enables a user to control a paddle with their device and respond to a moving ball on the peer user’s screen, as in the following figure\n\n\n\nFor guidance on designing nearby interactions, see the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/nearby-interactions].\n\n### Interact with Apple Watch\n\nThe UWB chip-capable Apple Watch running watchOS 8 supports Nearby Interaction sessions.
