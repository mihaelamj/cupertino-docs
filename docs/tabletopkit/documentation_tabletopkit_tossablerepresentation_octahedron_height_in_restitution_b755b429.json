In this orientation, the height (h) is measured from face to opposing face, and the vertices have the following coordinates, which all lie on a circumscribed sphere of radius r = h\/2 ⋅ sqrt(3): ±Y face: ±{          0, +1, -sqrt(2)   } ⋅ h\/2, ±{ -sqrt(6)\/2, +1, +sqrt(2)\/2 } ⋅ h\/2, ±{ +sqrt(6)\/2, +1, +sqrt(2)\/2 } ⋅ h\/2\n\nHigher restitution values indicate materials that conserve kinetic energy during collisions, causing objects to bounce off each other elastically. Lower values suggest materials that absorb kinetic energy, resulting in less bounce and more energy loss upon impact.",
