If the pose of some immediate children is not provided, the pose in their EquipmentState is used instead.",

If zero or less than zero the new pose will be applied instantly. If not specified a default duration will be used.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe height of the children is calculated by going over each equipment in the layout in the provided order and moving it to the lowest possible position so that it touches either the table or any of the siblings already placed.\n\nIf the layout contains poses for equipment that are not immediate children, those poses will be ignored. If the pose of some immediate children is not provided, the pose in their EquipmentState is used instead.\n\n## Laying out equipment\n\n- **planarOverlapping(layout:animationDuration:)**: Use the overlapping layout to provide 2d poses for the immediate children and let TabletopKit determine their height and pitch\/roll.\n- **volumetric(layout:animationDuration:)**: Use the volumetric layout to provide 3d poses for the immediate children directly.\n\n",
