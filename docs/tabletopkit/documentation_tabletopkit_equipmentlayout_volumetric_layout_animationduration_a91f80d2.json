If zero or less than zero the new pose will be applied instantly. If not specified a default duration will be used. If the layout contains poses for equipment that are not immediate children, those poses will be ignored. If the pose of some immediate children is not provided, the previous pose and duration will be used if available.\n\n## Laying out equipment\n\n- **planarOverlapping(layout:animationDuration:)**: Use the overlapping layout to provide 2d poses for the immediate children and let TabletopKit determine their height and pitch\/roll.\n- **planarStacked(layout:animationDuration:)**: Use the stacked layout to provide 2d poses for the immediate children and let TabletopKit determine their height.\n\n",
