Equipment that begins a toss in the same TabletopInteraction may interact with each other as well as the game’s boundary.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nfunc toss(equipmentID: EquipmentIdentifier, as representation: TossableRepresentation, linearVelocity: Vector3D? = nil, angularVelocity: Vector3D? = nil)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **equipmentID**: The equipment ID to use in the toss simulation.\n- **representation**: The representation that the toss simulation will treat the equipment as.\n- **linearVelocity**: The linear velocity the toss begins with. If nil, the simulation will use the interaction’s current linear velocity.\n- **angularVelocity**: The angular velocity the toss begins with. If nil, the simulation will use the interaction’s current angular velocity.\n\n## Performing actions\n\n- **TabletopInteraction.Delegate**: A protocol for objects that manage the entire flow of players interacting with equipment.\n- **TabletopInteraction.TossOutcome**: An object representing the final outcome of tossing one equipment, as it appears at the end of its simulation.\n- **addAction(_:)**: Submit an action tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.\n- **addAction(_:)**: Submit a custom action tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.\n- **addActions(_:)**: Submit a collection of actions tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.\n- **end()**: Ends the current interaction.\n- **cancel()**: Cancels the current interaction. All actions added to the interaction will also be cancelled.\n\n",
