If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.\n- **addActions(_:)**: Submit a collection of actions tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.\n- **toss(equipmentID:as:linearVelocity:angularVelocity:)**: Begins a simulation of a toss of the equipment with the specificied parameters. Equipment that begins a toss in the same TabletopInteraction may interact with each other as well as the game’s boundary.\n- **end()**: Ends the current interaction.\n- **cancel()**: Cancels the current interaction.
