Lower values suggest materials that absorb kinetic energy, resulting in less bounce and more energy loss upon impact.\n\n## Creating geometric shapes\n\n- **cube(height:in:restitution:)**: Creates a cube that the player tosses during gameplay.\n- **decahedron(height:in:restitution:)**: Creates a decahedron, a symmetrical, ten-faced polyhedron with kite-shaped faces, that the player tosses during gameplay.\n- **dodecahedron(height:in:restitution:)**: Creates a regular dodecahedron, a shape with 12 pentagonal faces, that the player tosses during gameplay.\n- **icosahedron(height:in:restitution:)**: Creates a regular icosahedron, a shape with 20 triangular faces, that the player tosses during gameplay.\n- **octahedron(height:in:restitution:)**: Creates a regular octahedron, a shape with 8 triangular faces, that the player tosses during gameplay.\n- **tetrahedron(height:in:restitution:)**: Creates a regular tetrahedron, a pyramid with four triangular faces, that the player tosses during gameplay.\n\n",
