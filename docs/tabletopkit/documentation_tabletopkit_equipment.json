For more complex data, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.tabletopkit\/documentation\/TabletopKit\/RawValueState].\n- Declare the `id` property as a [doc:\/\/com.apple.tabletopkit\/documentation\/TabletopKit\/EquipmentIdentifier] structure.\n- Implement an initializer that sets the `id` and [doc:\/\/com.apple.tabletopkit\/documentation\/TabletopKit\/Equipment\/initialState] properties.\n\nOptionally, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.tabletopkit\/documentation\/TabletopKit\/Equipment\/layoutChildren(for:visualState:)] method for equipment that represents groups, and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.tabletopkit\/documentation\/TabletopKit\/Equipment\/restingOrientation(state:)] method to provide a custom resting orientation.\n\n## Gettting the initial state of the equipment\n\n- **initialState**\n- **State**\n\n## Displaying the equipment\n\n- **layoutChildren(for:visualState:)**: This function provides the layout of the direct children of this equipment and is called whenever the snapshot changes. Override it to provide a custom layout. The output of this function is considered to be only a function of its inputs. Reaching out to data outside what is provided might result in undefined behavior.\n- **restingOrientation(state:)**: The resting orientation of the equipment given the current State.\n\n## Equipment\n\n- **Implementing playing card overlap and physical characteristics**: Add interactive card game behavior for a pile of playing cards with physically realistic stacking and overlapping.\n- **EquipmentCollection**: A collection of equipment whose state can be inspected and modified.\n- **EntityEquipment**: A protocol for equipment in a game that you render using RealityKit.\n- **EquipmentIdentifier**: A unique identifier for equipment.\n- **EquipmentState**: A protocol for the equipment data that TabletopKit syncs between players.\n- **EquipmentStateCollection**: A collection of equipment states that can be inspected and modified.\n- **BaseEquipmentState**: A state for equipment that contains no equipment-specific data.\n- **CustomEquipmentState**: A specialized protocol for the equipment state that allows to accommodate custom data that TabletopKit syncs between players.\n- **MutableEquipmentState**: A protocol for equipment data that TabletopKit syncs between players, and that can be mutated.\n- **CardState**: A state for cards that contains face up and down information.\n- **DieState**: A state for dice that contains the current value.\n- **RawValueState**: A state for equipment that contains a game-specific value.\n- **ControllingSeats**: The seats that can manipulate or interact with the equipment.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- Identifiable\n\n## Inherited By\n\n- EntityEquipment\n\n",
