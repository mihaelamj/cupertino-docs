A pentagonal trapezohedron has 10 identical symmetric kite shaped faces arranged around a spindle axis. In the physics simulation, it is scaled along the spindle axis to place all vertices exactly on the surface of a circumscribed sphere. In this orientation, the height (h) is measured from face to opposing face, and the vertices have the following coordinates, which all lie on a circumscribed sphere of radius r = 5^(1\/4) · h\/2 = sqrt(2·phi - 1) · h\/2 with an axial tilt angle ⍬ with tan(⍬) = sqrt(2\/phi): ±Y face: ±{ 0,           +1,       -sqrt(2\/phi)         } · h\/2, Equator: ±{ 0,           -1,       -sqrt(2\/phi)         } · h\/2, ±{+sqrt(2),     -1\/phi^3, -sqrt(2\/phi) \/ phi^2 } · h\/2, ±{+sqrt(2)\/phi, +1,       +sqrt(2\/phi) \/ phi   } · h\/2, ±{-sqrt(2)\/phi, +1,       +sqrt(2\/phi) \/ phi   } · h\/2, ±{-sqrt(2),     -1\/phi^3, -sqrt(2\/phi) \/ phi^2 } · h\/2\n\nHigher restitution values indicate materials that conserve kinetic energy during collisions, causing objects to bounce off each other elastically.
