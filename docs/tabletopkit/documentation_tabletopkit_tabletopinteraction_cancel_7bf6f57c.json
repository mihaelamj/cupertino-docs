All actions added to the interaction will also be cancelled.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nfunc cancel()\n```\n\n## Performing actions\n\n- **TabletopInteraction.Delegate**: A protocol for objects that manage the entire flow of players interacting with equipment.\n- **TabletopInteraction.TossOutcome**: An object representing the final outcome of tossing one equipment, as it appears at the end of its simulation.\n- **addAction(_:)**: Submit an action tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.\n- **addAction(_:)**: Submit a custom action tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.\n- **addActions(_:)**: Submit a collection of actions tied to this interaction. If the interaction gets canceled, all the associated actions will be automatically rolled back.\n- **toss(equipmentID:as:linearVelocity:angularVelocity:)**: Begins a simulation of a toss of the equipment with the specificied parameters. Equipment that begins a toss in the same TabletopInteraction may interact with each other as well as the game’s boundary.\n- **end()**: Ends the current interaction.\n\n",
