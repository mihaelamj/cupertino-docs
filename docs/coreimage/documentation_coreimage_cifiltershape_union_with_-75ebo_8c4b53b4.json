Core Image uses the rectangle specified by integer parts of the width and height.\n\n## Modifying a Filter Shape\n\n- **insetBy(x:y:)**: Modifies a filter shape object so that it is inset by the specified x and y values.\n- **intersect(with:)**: Creates a filter shape object that represents the intersection of the current filter shape and the specified filter shape object.\n- **intersect(with:)**: Creates a filter shape that represents the intersection of the current filter shape and a rectangle.\n- **transform(by:interior:)**: Creates a filter shape that results from applying a transform to the current filter shape.\n- **union(with:)**: Creates a filter shape that results from the union of the current filter shape and another filter shape object.\n\n",
