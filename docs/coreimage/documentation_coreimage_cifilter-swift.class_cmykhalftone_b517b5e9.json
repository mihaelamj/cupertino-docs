The dots contain only cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colors. Halftone effect is a set of lines, dots, or circles that contain detail. When viewing the image from a distance, the markings blend together creating the illusion of continuous lines and shapes. Print media commonly uses this effect.\n\nThe CMYK halftone filter uses the following properties:\n\nThe following code produces an image with visible dots and less color:\n\n",
