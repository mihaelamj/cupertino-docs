It’s best not to use draft mode if the image needs to be drawn without draft mode at a later time, because changing the value from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] is an expensive operation. If the optional scale factor is smaller than a certain value, additionally setting draft mode can improve image decoding speed without any perceivable loss of quality. However, turning on draft mode does not have any effect if the scale factor is not below this threshold.\n\n## Type Properties\n\n- **activeKeys**: A key for the set of input keys available for use.\n- **baselineExposure**: The amount of baseline exposure applied.\n- **boostAmount**: A key for the amount of boost to apply to an image.\n- **boostShadowAmount**: A key for the amount to boost the shadow areas of the image.\n- **ciInputEnableEDRModeKey**\n- **ciInputLocalToneMapAmountKey**\n- **colorNoiseReductionAmount**: A key for the amount of noise reduction to apply to color data in the image.\n- **decoderVersion**: A key for the version number of the method to be used for decoding. A newly initialized object defaults to the newest available decoder version for the given image type. You can request an alternative, older version to maintain compatibility with older releases. Must be one of the values listed for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIRAWFilterOption\/supportedDecoderVersions] key, otherwise a `nil` output image is generated. The associated value must be an `NSNumber` object that specifies an integer value in range of `0` to the current decoder version. When you request a specific version of the decoder, Core Image produces an image that is *visually* the same across different versions of the operating system. Core Image, however, does not guarantee that  the same bits are produced across different versions of the operating system. That’s because the rounding behavior of floating-point arithmetic can vary due to differences in compilers or hardware. Note that this option has no effect if the image used for initialization is not RAW.\n- **disableGamutMap**: Whether or not to disable gamut mapping.\n- **enableChromaticNoiseTracking**: A key for progressive chromatic noise tracking (based on ISO and exposure time).\n- **enableSharpening**: A key for the sharpening state.\n- **enableVendorLensCorrection**: A key for whether to automatically correct for image distortion from known lenses.\n- **ignoreImageOrientation**: A key for specifying whether to ignore the image orientation\n- **imageOrientation**: A key for the image orientation.\n- **linearSpaceFilter**: A key for the filter to apply to the image while it is temporarily in a linear color space as part of  RAW image processing. The associated value must be a [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIFilter-swift.class] object.\n\n",
