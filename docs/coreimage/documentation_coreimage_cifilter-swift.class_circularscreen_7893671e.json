The effect generates a monochrome image containing a series of circular rings. The halftone effect is a set of lines, dots, or circles that contain detail. When viewing the image from a distance, the markings blend together, creating the illusion of continuous lines and shapes. Print media commonly uses this effect.\n\nThe circular screen filter uses the following properties:\n\nThe following code creates a filter that results in a monochrome image with a large circular pattern overlaying the image:\n\n",
