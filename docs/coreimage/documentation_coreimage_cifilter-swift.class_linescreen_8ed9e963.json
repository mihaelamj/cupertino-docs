The effect generates a monochrome image containing a series of lines creating detail. The halftone effect is a set of lines, dots, or circles that contain detail. When viewing the image from a distance, the markings blend together, creating the illusion of continuous lines and shapes. Print media commonly uses this effect.\n\nThe line screen filter uses the following properties:\n\nThe following code creates a filter that creates a monochrome image containing small lines of detail on a black background:\n\n",
