If the image is not the output of a filter (or of a chain or graph of several [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIFilter-swift.class] objects), or the image in the `im` parameter is not an input to that filter, the rectangle returned is the same as that in the `r` parameter.\n\nFor example,",

If the image is not the output of a filter (or of a chain or graph of several [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIFilter-swift.class] objects), or the image in the `im` parameter is not an input to that filter, the rectangle returned is the same as that in the `r` parameter.\n\nFor example,\n\n- If the image is the output of a filter that doubles the size of its input image, the rectangle returned will be half the size of that in the `r` parameter. (Upscaling causes every pixel in the input image to correspond to multiple pixels in the output image.)\n- If the image is the output of a blur filter, the rectangle returned will be slightly larger than that in the `r` parameter. (In a blur filter, each pixel in the output image is produced using information from the corresponding pixel and those immediately surrounding it in the input image.)\n\n",
