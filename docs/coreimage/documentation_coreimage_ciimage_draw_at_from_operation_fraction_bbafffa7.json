The coordinates of this rectangle must be specified using the image’s own coordinate system.\n- **op**: The compositing operation to use when drawing the image. For details, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSCompositingOperation].\n- **delta**: The opacity of the image, specified as a value from `0.0` to `1.0`. Specifying a value of `0.0` draws the image as fully transparent while a value of `1.0` draws the image as fully opaque. Values greater than `1.0` are interpreted as `1.0`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe image content is drawn at its current resolution and is not scaled unless the CTM of the current coordinate system itself contains a scaling factor. The image is otherwise positioned and oriented using the current coordinate system.\n\n## Drawing Images\n\n- **draw(in:from:operation:fraction:)**: Draws all or part of the image in the specified rectangle in the current coordinate system\n\n",
