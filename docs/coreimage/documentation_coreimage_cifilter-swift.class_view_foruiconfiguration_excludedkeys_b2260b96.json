If you override [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Quartz\/IKFilterCustomUIProvider\/provideView(forUIConfiguration:excludedKeys:)] the user interface is created by your filter subclass. Otherwise, Core Image automatically generates the user interface based on the filter keys and attributes.\n\nYour app can retrieve a view whose control sizes complement the size of user interface elements already used in the application. It is also possible to choose which filter input parameters appear in the view. Consumer applications, for example, may want to show a small, basic set of input parameters whereas professional applications may want to provide access to all input parameters.\n\nWhen you request a user interface for a parameter set, all keys for that set and below are included. For example, the advanced set consists of all parameters in the basic, intermediate and advanced sets. The development set should contain parameters that are either experimental or for debugging purposes. You should use them only during the development of filters and client applications, and not in a shipping product.\n\nThe controls in the view use bindings to set the values of the filter.
