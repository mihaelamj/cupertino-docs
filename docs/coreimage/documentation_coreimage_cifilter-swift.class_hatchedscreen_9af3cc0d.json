The effect generates a monochrome image containing a series of lines in hatched pattern to create detail. The halftone effect is a set of lines, dots, or circles that contain detail. When viewing the image from a distance, the markings blend together, creating the illusion of continuous lines and shapes. The effect is often used in print media for more efficient printing.\n\nThe hatched screen filter uses the following properties:\n\nThe following code creates a filter that produces a monochrome image containing lines of detail on a black background:\n\n",
