Use this option with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIDetectorTypeRectangle] detector type to control the effect of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIDetectorAspectRatio] option on feature detection.\n\nThis option’s value can be `0.0`, `-1.0`, or any positive value:\n\n- The special value of `-1.0` (the default) disables the aspect ratio test for the returned rectangle.\n- The special value of `0.0` enables a less precise test of aspect ratio that approximates an orthographic (non-perspective) projection. Use this value if you want to specify the aspect ratio of the rectangle via the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIDetectorAspectRatio] option, but have no means of determining the value for the focal length in pixels. See below for a method to compute an approximate value for the focal length in pixels.\n- Any other value specifies the camera focal length, in pixels, allowing the aspect ratio specification to account for perspective distortion of rectangles in the input image.\n\nIf you know the diagonal field of view of the camera (the scene angle subtended by the diagonal corners of an image), you can use the following formula to compute an approximate focal length in pixels:\n\n`focal_length_pixels = (image_diagonal_pixels\/2)\/tan(FOV\/2)`\n\nIn this formula, `image_diagonal_pixels` is the length (in pixels) of the image diagonal of the maximum resolution of the camera sensor. (For example, this value is 4080 pixels for a 3264 x 2448 (8 megapixel) sensor, and 5000 pixels for a 4096x3024 (12 megapixel) sensor.)\n\nTo measure diagonal field of view, put the camera on a tripod so that it is perpendicular to a surface and the center of the image is oriented on a mark on the surface.

If the supplied [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIImage] has been scaled relative relative to the maximum sensor resolution, the supplied focal length must also be similarly scaled.\n\n## Constants\n\n- **CIDetectorImageOrientation**: An option for the display orientation of the image whose features you want to detect.\n- **CIDetectorEyeBlink**: An option for whether Core Image will perform additional processing to recognize closed eyes in detected faces.\n- **CIDetectorSmile**: An option for whether Core Image will perform additional processing to recognize smiles in detected faces.\n- **CIDetectorAspectRatio**: An option specifying the aspect ratio (width divided by height) of rectangles to search for.\n- **CIDetectorReturnSubFeatures**: An option specifying whether to return feature information for components of detected features.\n\n",
