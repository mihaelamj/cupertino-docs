Because [doc:\/\/com.apple.coreimage\/documentation\/CoreImage\/CIImage] objects are immutable, the texture  must remain unchanged for the life of the image object. See the discussion for more information.\n- **size**: The dimensions of the texture.\n- **flipped**: [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] to have Core Image flip the coordinates of the texture vertically to convert between OpenGL and Core Image coordinate systems.\n- **options**: A dictionary specifying image options.
