Each row begins and ends with special characters indicating the current row as well as information about the dimensions of the PDF417 symbol. The errorCorrectedPayload represents the sequence of PDF417 codewords that make up the body of the message. The first codeword indicates the number of codewords in the message. This count includes the “count” codeword and any padding codewords, but does not include the error correction codewords. Each codeword is a 16-bit value in the range of 0…928. The sequence is to be interpreted as described in the PDF417 bar code symbology specification – ISO\/IEC 15438:2006(E).",
