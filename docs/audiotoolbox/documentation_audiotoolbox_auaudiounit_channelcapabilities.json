An input\/output value pair of `(-1, -1)` (i.e. [0] = -1, [1] = -1) indicates that any number of channels are supported, as long as they are the same number for both input and output. An input\/output value pair combination of `-1` and `-2` (e.g. [0] = -1, [1] = -2) also indicates that any number of channels are supported, but without the requirement that the input and output counts are the same. A negative value less than `-2` (e.g. [0] = -16) specifies a total number of channels across every bus in that scope, regardless of how many channels are set on any particular bus.\n\nAn array value of `0` (e.g. [0] = 0) specifies that the input\/output channel is not applicable (though typically only used for input channels).\n\nThe table below shows a sample selection of valid input and output channel combinations:\n\nThis version 3 property is bridged to the version 2 `kAudioUnitProperty_SupportedNumChannels` API.",
