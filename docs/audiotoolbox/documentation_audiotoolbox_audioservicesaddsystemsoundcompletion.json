Pass `NULL` to use the main run loop.\n- **inRunLoopMode**: The mode for the run loop in which the callback functions should run. Pass `NULL` to use the default run loop mode.\n- **inCompletionRoutine**: The callback function to be invoked when the specified system sound has finished playing.\n- **inClientData**: Application data to be passed to your callback function when it is invoked. Can be `NULL`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA result code.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBecause a system sound may play for several seconds, you might want to know when it has finished playing.
