Workgroups provide the mechanism to coordinate the efforts of these different processes, and ensure that they execute on the same schedule. In an Audio Unit, use a render context observer to retrieve the workgroup that the host app uses for real-time audio rendering. In an app, fetch the workgroup for a Core Audio device directly from the device or from your [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/AUAudioUnit] object.\n\nIf your app has real-time rendering threads that operate on their own deadlines, create your own workgroup using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/AudioWorkIntervalCreate] function.
