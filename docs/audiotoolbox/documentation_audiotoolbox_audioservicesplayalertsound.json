Calling this function does the following on various iOS devices:\n\n- *iPhone*—plays the specified sound. If the user has configured the Settings application for vibration on ring, also invokes vibration. However, the device does *not* vibrate if your app’s audio session is configured with the  [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession\/Category-swift.struct\/playAndRecord] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFAudio\/AVAudioSession\/Category-swift.struct\/record] audio session category. This ensures that vibration doesn’t interfere with audio recording. For an explanation of audio session categories, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Audio\/Conceptual\/AudioSessionProgrammingGuide\/Introduction\/Introduction.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007875-CH1-SW4].\n- *iPod touch, original*—plays a short alert melody.\n- *iPod touch, 2nd generation and newer*—plays the specified sound.\n\nIn iOS, the duration of the sound to be played must not be more than 30 seconds.\n\n\n\nIn macOS, when a user has configured System Preferences to flash the screen for alerts, or if sound cannot be rendered, calling this function will result in the screen flashing.
