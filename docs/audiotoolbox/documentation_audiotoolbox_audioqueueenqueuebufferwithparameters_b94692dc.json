Before calling this function, the buffer must contain the audio data to be played.\n- **inNumPacketDescs**: The number of packets of audio data in the `inBuffer` parameter. Use a value of `0` for either of the following situations:\n\n- When playing a constant bit rate (CBR) format.\n- When the buffer you are reenqueuing was allocated with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/AudioQueueAllocateBufferWithPacketDescriptions(_:_:_:_:)] function. In this case, your callback should describe the buffer’s packets in the buffer’s `mPacketDescriptions` and `mPacketDescriptionCount` fields.\n- **inPacketDescs**: An array of packet descriptions. Use a value of `NULL` for either of the following situations:\n\n- When playing a constant bit rate (CBR) format.\n- When the buffer you are reenqueuing was allocated with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/AudioQueueAllocateBufferWithPacketDescriptions(_:_:_:_:)] function. In this case, your callback should describe the buffer’s packets in the buffer’s `mPacketDescriptions` and `mPacketDescriptionCount` fields.\n- **inTrimFramesAtStart**: The number of priming frames to skip at the start of the buffer.\n- **inTrimFramesAtEnd**: The number of frames to skip at the end of the buffer.\n- **inNumParamValues**: The number of audio queue parameter values pointed to by the `inParamValues` parameter. If you are not setting parameters, use `0`.\n- **inParamValues**: An array of parameters to apply to an audio queue buffer. (In OS X v10.5, there is only one audio queue parameter, `kAudioQueueParam_Volume`.)  If you are not setting parameters for the buffer, use `NULL`.\n\nAssign parameter values before playback—they cannot be changed while a buffer is playing. Changes to audio queue buffer parameters take effect when the buffer starts playing.\n- **inStartTime**: The desired start time for playing the buffer. To specify a time relative to when the audio queue started, use the `mSampleTime` field of the `AudioTimeStamp` structure. Use `NULL` to indicate that the buffer should play as soon as possible—which may be after previously queued buffers finish playing.\n\nBuffers play in the order they are enqueued (first in, first out). If multiple buffers are queued, the start times must be in ascending order or `NULL`; otherwise, an error occurs.  This parameter specifies when audio data is to start playing, ignoring any trim frames specified in the `inTrimFramesAtStart` parameter.\n- **outActualStartTime**: On output, the time when the buffer will actually start playing.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA result code. See Result Codes.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou can exert some control over the buffer queue with this function. You can assign audio queue settings that are, in effect, carried by an audio queue buffer as you enqueue it. Hence, settings take effect when an audio queue buffer begins playing.\n\nThis function applies only to playback. Recording audio queues do not take parameters and do not support variable bit rate (VBR) formats (which might require trimming).\n\n## Handling Audio Queue Buffers\n\n- **AudioQueueAllocateBuffer(_:_:_:)**: Asks an audio queue object to allocate an audio queue buffer.\n- **AudioQueueAllocateBufferWithPacketDescriptions(_:_:_:_:)**: Asks an audio queue object to allocate an audio queue buffer with space for packet descriptions.\n- **AudioQueueFreeBuffer(_:_:)**: Asks an audio queue to dispose of an audio queue buffer.\n- **AudioQueueEnqueueBuffer(_:_:_:_:)**: Adds a buffer to the buffer queue of a recording or playback audio queue.\n\n",
