If you use a value of `-1` for either the priming or remainder frames, the extended audio file object uses the corresponding value stored in the file.\n\nRetrieving the value of this property always retrieves the value the extended audio file object is using, whether derived from the file or from your override.\n\nTo determine the value in the file, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/kAudioFilePropertyPacketTableInfo] property as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/audio-file-services].\n\nWhen the property is set, only the remaining and priming values are used. Set the `mNumberValidFrames` field of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/AudioFilePacketTableInfo] struct to zero. For example, a file encoded using AAC may have 2112 samples of priming at the start of the file and a remainder of 823 samples at the end. When an extended audio file object returns decoded samples to you, it trims off the  at the start of the file, and trims off the  at the end. It gets these numbers initially from the file. A common use case for overriding this would be to set the priming and remainder samples to `0`. In this example, you would retrieve an additional 2112 samples of silence from the start of the file and 823 samples of silence at the end of the file (silence, because the encoders use silence to pad out these priming and remainder samples).",
