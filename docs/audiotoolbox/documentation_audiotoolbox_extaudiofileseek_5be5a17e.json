Seek position is specified in the sample rate and frame count of the file’s audio data format—not your application’s audio data format.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA result code.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSets the file’s read position to the specified sample frame number. A subsequent call to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/ExtAudioFileRead(_:_:_:)] function returns samples from precisely this location, even if it is located in the middle of a packet.\n\nEnsure that the file you are seeking in is open for reading only. This function’s behavior with files open for writing is undefined.\n\n## Reading and Writing Audio Data\n\n- **ExtAudioFileRead(_:_:_:)**: Performs a synchronous, sequential read operation on an audio file.\n- **ExtAudioFileTell(_:_:)**: Gets an audio file’s read\/write position.\n- **ExtAudioFileWrite(_:_:_:)**: Performs a synchronous, sequential write operation on an audio file.\n- **ExtAudioFileWriteAsync(_:_:_:)**: Perform an asynchronous, sequential write operation on an audio file.\n\n",
