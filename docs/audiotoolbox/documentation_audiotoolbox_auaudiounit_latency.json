A host is usually only prepared to add delays before starting to render and those delays need to be fixed. A variable delay would introduce artifacts even if the host could track it. If an algorithm has a variable latency, it should be adjusted upwards to some fixed latency within the audio unit. If for some reason this is not possible, then latency could be regarded as an unavoidable consequence of the algorithm and left unreported (i.e. a value of `0`).\n\nThis version 3 property is bridged to the version 2 `kAudioUnitProperty_Latency` API.",
