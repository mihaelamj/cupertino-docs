Use a value of `0` for any of the following situations:\n\n- When playing a constant bit rate (CBR) format.\n- When the audio queue is a recording (input) audio queue.\n- When the buffer you are reenqueuing was allocated with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/AudioQueueAllocateBufferWithPacketDescriptions(_:_:_:_:)] function. In this case, your callback should describe the buffer’s packets in the buffer’s `mPacketDescriptions` and `mPacketDescriptionCount` fields.\n- **inPacketDescs**: An array of packet descriptions. Use a value of `NULL` for any of the following situations:\n\n- When playing a constant bit rate (CBR) format.\n- When the audio queue is an input (recording) audio queue.\n- When the buffer you are reenqueuing was allocated with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.audiotoolbox\/documentation\/AudioToolbox\/AudioQueueAllocateBufferWithPacketDescriptions(_:_:_:_:)] function.
