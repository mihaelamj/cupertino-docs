Only MIDI based events are used when creating the MIDI file. MIDI files are normally beat based, but can also have a SMPTE (or real-time rather than beat time) representation.\n\nThe inResolution parameter specifies the relationship between “tick” and quarter note for saving to a standard MIDI file. Pass 0 to this parameter to use the default value; namely, the value that is currently set on the tempo track.\n\nThe various sequence types determine the kinds of files that can be created, as follows:\n\n- Beats—When saving a MIDI file, it saves a beats (PPQ) based axis.\n- Seconds—When saving a MIDI file, it will save it as a SMPTE resolution - so you should specify this resolution when creating the MIDI file. If zero is specified, 25 fps and 40 ticks\/frame is used (a time scale of a millisecond)\n- Samples—You cannot save to a MIDI file with this sequence type.\n\nThe complete meaning of the 16-bit “division” field in a MIDI File’s MThd chunk. If it is positive, then a tick represents 1\/D quarter notes.  If it negative, the following pertains:\n\n- Bits 14-8 are a signed 7-bit number representing the SMPTE format: 24, -25, -29 (drop), -30.\n- Bits 7-0 represents the number of ticks per SMPTE frame. Typical values are 4, 10, 80, 100. You can obtain millisecond resolution by specifying 25 frames\/sec and 40 divisions\/frame:\n\n```objc\n  30 fps with 80 bits (ticks) per frame: 0xE250  ((char)0xE2 == -30)\n```\n\n## Managing Music Sequences\n\n- **NewMusicSequence(_:)**: Creates a new empty music sequence.\n- **DisposeMusicSequence(_:)**: Disposes of a music sequence.\n- **MusicSequenceBarBeatTimeToBeats(_:_:_:)**: Formats a music sequence’s bar-beat time to its beat time.\n- **MusicSequenceBeatsToBarBeatTime(_:_:_:_:)**: Formats a music sequence’s beat time to its bar-beat time.\n- **MusicSequenceDisposeTrack(_:_:)**: Removes a music track from a music sequence, and disposes of the track.\n- **MusicSequenceFileCreateData(_:_:_:_:_:)**: Creates a data object containing the events from a music sequence.\n- **MusicSequenceFileLoad(_:_:_:_:)**: Loads data into a music sequence from a URL reference.\n- **MusicSequenceFileLoadData(_:_:_:_:)**: Load data into a music sequence from a data reference.\n- **MusicSequenceGetAUGraph(_:_:)**: Gets the audio processing graph associated with a music sequence.\n- **MusicSequenceGetBeatsForSeconds(_:_:_:)**: Calculates the number of beats that correspond to a number of seconds.\n- **MusicSequenceGetIndTrack(_:_:_:)**: Gets the music track at the specified track index.\n- **MusicSequenceGetInfoDictionary(_:)**: Returns a dictionary containing music sequence information.\n- **MusicSequenceGetSMPTEResolution(_:_:_:)**\n- **MusicSequenceGetSecondsForBeats(_:_:_:)**: Calculates the number of seconds that correspond to a number of beats.\n- **MusicSequenceGetSequenceType(_:_:)**: Gets the sequence type for a music sequence.\n\n",
