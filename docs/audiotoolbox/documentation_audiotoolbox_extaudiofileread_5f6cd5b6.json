On output, the number of frames actually read. Fewer frames may be read than were requested. For example, the supplied buffers may not be large enough to accommodate the requested data. If `0` frames are returned, end-of-file was reached.\n- **ioData**: One or more buffers into which the audio data is read.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA result code.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the extended audio file object has an application data format, then the object’s converter converts the file data to the application format.\n\nThis function works only on a single thread.
