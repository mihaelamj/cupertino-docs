Use the handler to cancel any ongoing work and to do any required cleanup in as short a time as possible.\n\nThe handler may be called before the background process uses the full amount of its allocated time.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe time allocated by the system for expiration handlers doesn’t vary with the number of background tasks. All expiration handlers must complete before the allocated time.\n\nNot setting an expiration handler results in the system marking your task as complete and unsuccessful instead of sending a warning.\n\nThe manager sets the value `expirationHandler` to `nil` after the handler completes.\n\n## Configuring a Task\n\n- **setTaskCompleted(success:)**: Informs the background task scheduler that the task is complete.\n\n",
