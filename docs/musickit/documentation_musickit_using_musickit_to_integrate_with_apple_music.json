In the Project navigator, select the project and click the *Signing & Capabilities* tab.\n2. Select your developer team from the *Team* menu.\n3. Choose a new bundle identifier for the `MusicAlbums` target, and enter it in the Bundle Identifier field. The bundle identifier within the project has an associated App ID, so you need a unique identifier to create your own App ID. Use a reverse-DNS format for your identifier, as [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/preparing-your-app-for-distribution] describes.\n4. In Safari, visit the [link-3835255] section of the developer web site.\n5. Select *Identifiers* and click the Add button to create a new App ID for `MusicAlbums`. Follow the steps until you reach the *Register an App ID* page.\n6. For the Bundle ID, select *Explicit*, and enter the bundle identifier from step 2.\n7. Click the *App Services* tab, and select the MusicKit checkbox.\n8. Complete the App ID creation process.\n\nAfter creating your App ID, your Xcode project needs no additional configuration. The MusicKit App Service is a run-time service that automatically associates with your app’s bundle ID.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Using Automatic Developer Token Generation for Apple Music API**: Enable your app’s integration with the MusicKit App Service in the developer portal.\n- **Explore more content with MusicKit**: Track your outdoor runs with access to the Apple Music catalog, personal recommendations, and your own personal music library.\n\n",
