You decide which annotation view to use for a particular annotation by implementing [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MapKit\/MKMapViewDelegate\/mapView(_:viewFor:)-8humz] in the map’s delegate. In MapKit JS, there’s only the annotation, which is both model and view. You can still customize the look of annotations, but MapKit JS requires that you create annotation views explicitly rather than through a delegate.\n\nMapKit JS shows single-point annotations on a map. The framework accomplishes this by creating a [doc:\/\/com.apple.mapkitjs\/documentation\/MapKitJS\/Annotation] object and adding it to a map. The framework provides three built-in objects for your convenience:\n\nA callout is a standard or custom element that can give more information about an annotation. A standard callout displays the annotation’s title and subtitle, if you provide them. A callout appears when the user selects an annotation interactively (by clicking or tapping), or programmatically when you set the annotation’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.mapkitjs\/documentation\/MapKitJS\/Annotation\/selected] property to `true`. A callout goes away when the user deselects an annotation interactively either by tapping or clicking the map or by selecting another item on the map, or when you deselect it programmatically.\n\n**Annotation events**",
