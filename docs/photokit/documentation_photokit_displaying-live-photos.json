  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/PhotosUI\/PHLivePhotoView] class provides a way to display Live Photos—pictures, taken on compatible hardware, that include motion and sound from the moments just before and after their capture. A Live Photo view provides the same interactive playback features found in the Photos app.\n\nIn iOS and tvOS, you can fetch Live Photo objects to display in a Live Photo view with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHLivePhoto] class in the Photos framework. In macOS, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHLivePhoto] class provides access to Live Photos being edited in a photo editing extension for the Photos app.\n\nTo display Live Photo content on the web, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/LivePhotosKitJS] framework.\n\n### Control Live Photo Playback\n\nAfter obtaining a [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHLivePhoto] object, use a Live Photo view to display the photo and control playback of its motion and sound content. In iOS and tvOS, you can obtain Live Photos from the user’s photo library using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController], [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHAsset], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHImageManager] classes, or by creating one from asset resources exported from a photo library. In macOS, Live Photos are available only when editing Live Photo content in a photo editing extension that runs in the Photos app—see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHContentEditingInput] class to access Live Photos in an editing session.\n\nBy default, a Live Photo view uses its own gesture recognizer to allow the user to play the motion and sound content of a Live Photo with the same interactions and visual effects seen in the Photos app. To customize this gesture recognizer—for example, to install it on a different view for proper event handling in your app’s view hierarchy—use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/PhotosUI\/PHLivePhotoView\/playbackGestureRecognizer] property.\n\nTypically, an app doesn’t need to directly control Live Photo playback. In some situations, however, it can be useful to briefly animate the view to indicate to the user that a picture is a Live Photo. To do this, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/PhotosUI\/PHLivePhotoView\/startPlayback(with:)] method with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/PhotosUI\/PHLivePhotoViewPlaybackStyle\/hint] option.",
