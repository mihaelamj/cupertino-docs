  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIn iOS 26.1 and later, PhotoKit provides a new Background Resource Upload extension type that enables photo apps to provide seamless cloud backup experiences. The system manages uploads on your app’s behalf, and processes them in the background even when people switch to other apps or lock their devices. The system calls your extension when it’s time to process uploads, and it automatically handles network connectivity, power management, and timing to provide reliable processing.\n\n## Create and configure the extension target\n\nTo add an upload extension to your app, begin by adding a new target:\n\nOpen your extension’s main Swift file and replace its contents with a class that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension] protocol:\n\nThe extension conforms to this protocol by adopting the following methods:\n\nNavigate to your extension’s `Info.plist` file and provide the entries shown below:\n\n\n\n## Enable the extension\n\nBefore the system can call your extension, your host app must explicitly enable it by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(_:)] on the shared photo library instance. Your app must have full library access before enabling the extension. Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/requestAuthorization(for:handler:)] with the `.readWrite` access level and verify the status is `.authorized`.\n\nThe following example shows how to enable the background upload extension in your host app:\n\nCheck the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/uploadJobExtensionEnabled] property to verify the extension’s current state. To stop background processing, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(_:)] method with a value of `false`.\n\n## Process upload jobs\n\nThe system calls your extension’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension\/process()] method when upload work is available. A typical implementation of this method performs three tasks in sequence; it:\n\nAfter performing your processing, return an appropriate [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadProcessingResult] value to indicate your extension’s state:\n\nHandle [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotosError-swift.struct\/limitExceeded] by returning `.processing` to pause until space becomes available. For other errors, log the details and return `.failure`.\n\n## Retry failed jobs\n\nNetwork issues or temporary server problems can cause upload failures. Retrying these jobs allows your extension to recover from transient errors without user intervention. Jobs in the `.failed` state that haven’t exceeded the retry limit are eligible for your extension to try processing again.\n\nFetch retry-able jobs by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHAssetResourceUploadJob\/fetchJobs(action:options:)] method with the `.retry` action, shown here:\n\nBecause [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHFetchResult] doesn’t conform to `Sequence`, use index-based enumeration instead. All job mutations must occur within a [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/performChangesAndWait(_:)] closure. Passing `nil` to [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHAssetResourceUploadJobChangeRequest\/retry(destination:)] uses the original destination URL. Alternatively, you can configure a retry of the job with a different destination. The system limits retry attempts and throws [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotosError-swift.struct\/limitExceeded] when you exceed that threshold.\n\n## Acknowledge completed jobs\n\nJobs that you create consume space in the extension’s in-flight job limit. When a job completes, either successfully or with failure, acknowledge them to free capacity for new uploads.\n\nFetch acknowledgeable jobs by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHAssetResourceUploadJob\/fetchJobs(action:options:)] method with the `.acknowledge` action, shown here:\n\nAfter confirming each job’s upload status with your server or local tracking system, acknowledge it by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHAssetResourceUploadJobChangeRequest\/acknowledge()] method on the change request. Acknowledging a job removes it from system tracking and frees up space for new jobs. You must acknowledge completed jobs before creating new ones when you reach the in-flight limit.\n\n## Create upload jobs\n\nCreating upload jobs queues asset resources for background upload to your server. Each job requires a destination URL request that specifies where the system should upload the resource.\n\nCreate jobs after acknowledging completed ones and when you detect new assets in the library. Your extension needs a mechanism to identify which assets require upload — typically by maintaining a list of processed asset identifiers.\n\nJob creation must occur within a change block. Each [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHAssetResource] you upload requires a separate job. The destination [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLRequest] contains your server endpoint, authentication headers, and any metadata needed for upload processing.\n\nThe system enforces an in-flight job limit, and when you exceed it, calls to [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHAssetResourceUploadJobChangeRequest\/createJob(destination:resource:)] result in the system throwing a [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotosError-swift.struct\/limitExceeded] exception. When job creation throws `limitExceeded`, acknowledge completed jobs first, then retry creation. Return `.processing` from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension\/process()] method to have the system call your extension again after upload progress occurs. While your extension has jobs to process, keep the job queue filled to its limit to ensure efficient processing.\n\n## Handle extension termination\n\nThe system calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension\/notifyTermination()] before suspending or terminating your extension. Use this method to stop current work and clean up resources.\n\nThe system may call this method at any time, including while the extension processes uploads. Ensure the extension exits the process method as quickly as possible after receiving a termination notification.\n\nUpon receiving a termination notification, cancel any in-progress work such as network requests or database operations. Set cancellation flags for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension\/process()] method to check periodically to interrupt processing.",

The system manages uploads on your app’s behalf, and processes them in the background even when people switch to other apps or lock their devices. The system calls your extension when it’s time to process uploads, and it automatically handles network connectivity, power management, and timing to provide reliable processing.\n\n\n\n## Create and configure the extension target\n\nTo add an upload extension to your app, begin by adding a new target:\n\n1. In Xcode, choose File > New > Target.\n2. In the dialog, select the iOS tab, choose the Generic Extension template, and click Next.\n3. Specify a name for your extension, such as `BackgroundUploadExtension`.\n4. Click Finish.\n\nOpen your extension’s main Swift file and replace its contents with a class that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension] protocol:\n\n```swift\nimport Photos\nimport ExtensionFoundation\n\n@main\nclass BackgroundUploadExtension: PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension {\n    required init() {}\n\n    func process() -> PHBackgroundResourceUploadProcessingResult {\n        \/\/ Process upload jobs.\n        return .completed\n    }\n\n    func notifyTermination() {\n        \/\/ Prepare for termination.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe extension conforms to this protocol by adopting the following methods:\n\n\n\nNavigate to your extension’s `Info.plist` file and provide the entries shown below:\n\n- Expand the `EXAppExtensionAttributes` dictionary and change its `EXExtensionPointIdentifier` value to `com.apple.photos.background-upload`. This identifier registers your extension with the system’s background upload infrastructure.\n- Add a new top-level key to the `Info.plist` file, named `BackgroundUploadURLBase` of type `String`. Set its value to the base URL for your upload server, such as `https:\/\/api.example.com`. The system requires this key for network access validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Enable the extension\n\nBefore the system can call your extension, your host app must explicitly enable it by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(_:)] on the shared photo library instance. Your app must have full library access before enabling the extension. Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/requestAuthorization(for:handler:)] with the `.readWrite` access level and verify the status is `.authorized`.\n\nThe following example shows how to enable the background upload extension in your host app:\n\n```swift\nlet library = PHPhotoLibrary.shared()\n\n\/\/ Request full library access first.\nlet status = await PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for: .readWrite)\nguard status == .authorized else {\n    \/\/ Handle unauthorized state.\n    return\n}\n\n\/\/ Enable the upload extension.\ndo {\n    try library.setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(true)\n    print(\"Extension enabled successfully\")\n} catch {\n    print(\"Failed to enable extension: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\nCheck the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/uploadJobExtensionEnabled] property to verify the extension’s current state. To stop background processing, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotoLibrary\/setUploadJobExtensionEnabled(_:)] method with a value of `false`.\n\n\n\n## Process upload jobs\n\nThe system calls your extension’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadExtension\/process()] method when upload work is available. A typical implementation of this method performs three tasks in sequence; it:\n\n1. Retries failed uploads.\n2. Acknowledges completed or failed uploads to free resources.\n3. Creates new upload jobs for unprocessed assets, if needed.\n\n```swift\nfunc process() -> PHBackgroundResourceUploadProcessingResult {\n    do {\n        \/\/ Retry any failed jobs.\n        try retryFailedJobs()\n\n        \/\/ Acknowledge completed jobs to free up the in-flight job limit.\n        try acknowledgeCompletedJobs()\n\n        \/\/ Create new upload jobs for unprocessed assets.\n        try createNewUploadJobs()\n\n        return .completed\n    } catch let error as NSError {\n        if error.domain == PHPhotosErrorDomain &&\n           error.code == PHPhotosError.limitExceeded.rawValue {\n            \/\/ Reach the in-flight job limit; return `.processing`.\n            return .processing\n        }\n        \/\/ Other errors.\n        return .failure\n    } catch {\n        return .failure\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter performing your processing, return an appropriate [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHBackgroundResourceUploadProcessingResult] value to indicate your extension’s state:\n\n\n\nHandle [doc:\/\/com.apple.photokit\/documentation\/Photos\/PHPhotosError-swift.struct\/limitExceeded] by returning `.processing` to pause until space becomes available.
