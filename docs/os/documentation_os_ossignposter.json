  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nSignposts allow you to record meaningful information about the duration of your app’s tasks using the same subsystems and categories that you use for logging. Use `OSSignposter` to create signposted intervals in your code, and then use Instruments’ `os_signposts` instrument to record those intervals as you run your app and perform the actions to measure. Instruments displays signpost data visually in a timeline.\n\n\n\nTo add a signposted interval, create a signpost ID — an identifier that disambiguates intervals that have the same name, subsystem, and category, and that exist within the same scope — and then add a call to one of the class’s `beginInterval` methods just before the code you want to measure. Retain the interval state it returns, and end the interval by passing that state to one of the class’s `endInterval` methods, which you call immediately after the measured code. A signposter uses interval state to enforce a number of runtime assertions, the behavior of which depends on your app’s build configuration. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.os\/documentation\/os\/OSSignpostIntervalState]. A signposted interval consists of one begin call and one end call only.\n\n`OSSignposter` also provides functionality to signpost a closure, and to emit individual signposts that don’t have a duration that you can use to highlight points of interest, such as when the user taps a button or performs a specific gesture.",
