Log messages provide a continuous record of your app’s runtime behavior, and make it easier to identify problems that can’t be caught easily using other techniques. Specifically, you might use log messages:\n\n- When you are unable to attach a debugger to the app, such as when you’re diagnosing problems on a user’s machine.\n- When the problem is intermittent, and is difficult to catch in the debugger.\n- When you want to get a general sense of your app’s behavior—for example, you want to know when certain tasks start and end.\n\nThe unified logging system provides a comprehensive and performant API to capture telemetry across all levels of the system.
