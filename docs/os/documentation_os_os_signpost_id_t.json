In order for data-processing tools to correctly match the beginning and end of an interval, you need to identify each interval with a unique signpost identifier. Use the first strategy in the list below that matches your use case:\n\n- If you can guarantee that intervals with the same log and name can never overlap in time, specify [doc:\/\/com.apple.os\/documentation\/os\/OS_SIGNPOST_ID_EXCLUSIVE] as the signpost ID.\n- If you already have your own integer data that can uniquely identify each instance of the task being measured, cast the data from a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/kernel\/uint64_t] value directly to a `os_signpost_id_t`. The value must not match one of the predefined signpost values.\n- If you have a pointer that can uniquely identify begin\/end pairs (such as a pointer to a data object used by the code being measured), call [doc:\/\/com.apple.os\/documentation\/os\/os_signpost_id_make_with_pointer]. Don’t use this function for signposts that span process boundaries.\n- Otherwise, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.os\/documentation\/os\/os_signpost_id_generate] each time you create a new pair of signposts to generate a unique value for that pair.\n\n## Measure Events\n\n- **Recording Performance Data**: Add signposts to record interesting time-based events.\n- **OSSignposter**: An object for measuring task performance using the unified logging system.\n- **Legacy Signpost Symbols**: Migrate your code away from using these legacy symbols.\n- **OSSignpostType**: The different kinds of signpost.\n\n",
