The steps involved are:\n\n- looking up the distributed function based on its name\n- decoding, in an efficient manner, all arguments from the `Args` container into a well-typed representation\n- using that representation to perform the call on the target method\n\nThe reason for this API using a `ResultHandler` rather than returning values directly, is that thanks to this approach it can avoid any existential boxing, and can serve the most latency sensitive-use-cases.\n\n\n\n",
