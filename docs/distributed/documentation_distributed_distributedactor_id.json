For example, calling `resolve(id:using:)` multiple times, is not guaranteed to return the same exact resolved actor instance, however all the references would represent logically references to the same distributed actor, e.g. on a different node.\n\nDepending on the capabilities of the actor system producing the identifiers, the `ID` may also be used to store instance specific metadata.\n\n## Synthesized property\n\nIn concrete distributed actor declarations, a witness for this protocol requirement is synthesized by the compiler.\n\nIt is not possible to assign a value to the `id` directly; instead, it is assigned during an actors `init` (or `resolve`), by the managing actor system.",
