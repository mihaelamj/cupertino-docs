This pattern allows the runtime to use a heavily optimized, pre-allocated buffer for all the arguments and their expected types. The ‘pointer’ passed here is a pointer to a “slot” in that pre-allocated buffer. That buffer will then be passed to a thunk that performs the actual distributed (local) instance method invocation.\n\n### Serialization Requirement\n\nImplementations of this method must ensure that the `Argument` type parameter conforms to the types’ `SerializationRequirement`.",
