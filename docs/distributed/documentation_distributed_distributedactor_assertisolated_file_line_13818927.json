The default is where this method was called.\n- **line**: The line number to print if the assertion fails The default is where this method was called.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function’s effect varies depending on the build flag used:\n\n- In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode’s Debug configuration), stops program execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.\n- In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode’s Release configuration), the isolation check is not performed and there are no effects.\n\n\n\n",
