  "overview" : "### Decoding DistributedActor arguments using Codable\n\nWhen using an actor system where `ActorID` is `Codable`, every distributed actor using that system is also implicitly `Codable` (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Swift\/documentation\/Distributed\/DistributedActorSystem]). Such distributed actors are encoded as their `ActorID` stored in an `Encoder\/singleValueContainer`. When `Codable` is being used by such a system, the `decodeNextArgument` method will be using `Decoder` to decode the incoming values, which may themselves be distributed actors.\n\nAn actor system must be provided to the `Decoder` in order for a distributed actor’s `Decodable\/init(from:)` to be able to return the instance of the actor. Specifically, the decoded`ActorID` is passed to the actor system’s `resolve(id:as:)` method in order to return either a local instance identified by this ID, or creating a remote actor reference. Thus, you must set the actor system the decoding is performed for, on the decoder’s `userInfo`, as follows:",
