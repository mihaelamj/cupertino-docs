The Xcode 13.1 release supports on-device debugging for iOS 9 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 13.1 requires a Mac running macOS 11.3 or later.\n\n### Debugging\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Console, Xcode, `lldb`, and debugging tools can’t symbolicate crash logs that macOS transfers from connected devices running iOS 15, watchOS 8, or tvOS 15. (78124467, 83760462, 84048036, 84048399) (FB9669482)\n\n**Workaround**: Use Xcode’s Devices & Simulators window > View Device Logs to import log files from connected devices, and transform them into a human-readable form. You can also access crash logs directly on iOS devices using the Settings app under Privacy > Analytics > Analytics Data and use the share sheet to transfer them to a Mac without any loss of information. Open the resulting log files using Console, or by dragging and dropping them onto Xcode in the Dock.\n\n### Interface Builder\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed rendering issues that affected [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITableView] for some iOS storyboards. (82731572, 83465487)\n- Fixed an issue where iPhone 13 mini wouldn’t rotate to landscape orientation. (83465491)\n\n### Source Control\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Adding commits to a pull request in Xcode may not update the Changes navigator until you re-launch Xcode. (70398244)\n\n**Workaround**: Re-launch Xcode.\n- The Recent Branches section may continue to display an Upstream Arrow on a branch after you push changes on that branch. (80597226)\n\n**Workaround**: Restart Xcode to update the status.\n- Xcode may not correctly format code in pull request comments. (82143328)\n- Xcode may forget or reject credentials for GitLab Self-Hosted accounts. (82501314)\n- Repositories Navigator may sometimes display the current branch indicator on multiple branches. (82629835)\n\n**Workaround**: Re-launch Xcode or wait for the status of these files to update.\n- In Flat view mode, the Commit sheet may sometimes present without selecting a file. (83417116)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- In Previews and in simulated iOS 15 devices, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Button] elements support the iPad cursor hover states by default, but in iOS 15.1 [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/BorderedButtonStyle] no longer has a default hover effect. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/HoverEffect] modifier on the `Button` to add a default hover effect when running in iOS 15.1.
