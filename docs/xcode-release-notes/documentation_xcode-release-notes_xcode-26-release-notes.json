Xcode 26 supports on-device debugging in iOS 15 and later, tvOS 15 and later, watchOS 8 and later, and visionOS. Xcode 26 requires a Mac running macOS Sequoia 15.6 or later.\n\nEnhance your development workflow with coding intelligence features that help you write code, generate tests and documentation, fix errors, refactor existing implementations, and navigate codebases. Xcode has integrated support for ChatGPT and Claude user accounts. You can also use your API key for any model provider that supports the Chat Completions API, or download and run a local model on Macs with Apple silicon.\n\n- Interact with code using natural language in the coding assistant, with automatic context gathering, conversation history, and file attachment support.\n- Coding Tools provide contextual actions to quickly generate documentation, explain highlighted code, generate previews and playgrounds, and make inline changes.\n- Predictive code completion is faster and uses more context from your code, all running locally.\n\nAlso in Xcode 26:\n\n- The #Playground macro enables interactive debugging and code exploration in the preview panel.\n- Icon Composer streamlines icon creation from a single design with adjustable depth properties and dynamic lighting effects, and offers customization across Default, Dark, and Mono rendering modes.\n- A redesigned tab experience simplifies navigation with features like in-tab navigation and pinning to keep files in focus.\n- Compilation Caching accelerates build times with performance improvements when switching between branches or performing clean builds.\n- New instruments enhance app analysis with Processor Trace capturing every function call, SwiftUI for view profiling, Power Profiler for battery and thermal analysis, and CPU Counters for identifying performance bottlenecks.\n- Swift concurrency debugging follows execution across asynchronous functions and threads with readable concurrency type representations and enhanced visibility for task properties and relationships.\n- String Catalogs simplify localization with type-safe Swift symbols for direct string access, autocomplete support, and AI-generated contextual comments using on-device intelligence.\n- Voice Control now supports code dictation in Swift with syntax-aware recognition and automatic formatting.\n\n### General\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Hang and Launch diagnostics are enhanced with trending insights, calling attention to issues that have increased in impact over the last 4 app versions and providing additional context on the general change in impact to better highlight the prevalence. Leverage these insights, called out with a flame icon in the source list, to understand when an issue may have been introduced and to prioritize performance optimizations in new versions of your app.   (135376723)\n- Added a new setting that dictates how function names are displayed in C++ frames: plugin.cplusplus.display.function-name-format\n\nBy default this displays the entirety of a function name, but can be customized to drop various parts of a function signature (e.g., return type, scope qualifiers, etc.). See https:\/\/lldb.llvm.org\/use\/formatting.html#function-name-formats for more details.\n\nBy default LLDB will now highlight the function basename when displayed in C++ frames (e.g., in the backtrace).  (150174227)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The alert shown when a file, project, or workspace is modified by a different program while also opened in Xcode had inconsistent button labeling, and the default action did not always keep the Xcode version of the file.  (86281699)\n- Fixed: The `span` property of `UTF8View` does not support the small string representation and traps for small `String` instances.   (137710901)\n- Fixed: Added support for backtick-escaped raw identifiers in Swift.  (140952488)\n- Fixed: Xcode may crash on launch restoring UI state.  (152042209)\n- Fixed: To mimic Xcode 16 tab behavior use these settings: Xcode -> Settings -> Navigation -> Pin Tabs -> When Document Is Edited View > Show Editor Tab Bar  (153670772) (FB18158843)\n- Fixed: In Settings > Navigation, Option+Click and Option+Shift+Click can be configured to Use New Unpinned Tab or Use New Pinned Tab  (154324695)\n- Fixed: The XcodeXIP (Apple silicon only) cannot build source editor extensions.  (157257485)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The Related Items menu has been simplified to items to improve editor load times. Assistant Categories like Callers are still available in the Assistant Editor. There is also similar functionality available via editor context menus or in the Find Navigator.  (147335052)\n- Simulators may fail to boot during the first build after upgrading macOS; rebuilding after a short wait typically resolves the issue.  (152328794)\n- Sometimes the “Cancel” button in the Coding Assistant status bar fails to stop the currently executing message.  (152546155)\n\n**Workaround:** Use the Coding Assistant navigator directly, and click “Cancel”.\n- Users updating from earlier Xcode 26 betas may experience an error such as “fatal error: ‘iostream’ file not found” when using C++ standard headers.  (152924178) (FB17859821)\n\n**Workaround:** In Terminal, execute the command:\n\n```\n sudo rm -rf \/Library\/Developer\/CommandLineTools\/usr\/include\/c++\/v1\n```\n\n### Address Sanitizer\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Address Sanitizer C++ container overflow checks are no longer disabled by default and cannot be disabled at compile time from Xcode build settings.  (157770563)\n\n**Workaround:** Disable the checks at run time by setting the `ASAN_OPTIONS` environment variable to `detect_container_overflow=0` or adding it to your existing `ASAN_OPTIONS`. Add this setting to the Environment Variables list in the Arguments tab of the Run scheme in the scheme editor and in the Configurations tab of any Test Plan that uses Address Sanitizer.\n\n### App Intents\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Conforming to `TargetContentProvidingIntent` and `OpenIntent` generates a compiler error about ambiguous inference of `PerformResult`.  (152099549)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- UISceneAppIntent.performNavigation(forScene:) not always called.  (152254774)\n\n### Apple TV\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Apple TV might fail to authorize and attempt to launch a properly signed app that is being run immediately after installation from Xcode, with a spurious error indicating that the Developer App certificate needs to be trusted on the device.  (154812309)\n\n### Asset Catalog\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Unable to set Icon Composer icon as alternate iOS icon  (153305178) (FB18025356)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Some developers may get an incorrect build warning from actool: “Failed to generate flattened icon stack for icon named…” This can be safely ignored.  (158698677)\n\n### AssistantSchemas\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: If you have adopted any of the following email AssistantSchemas, you will experience a compilation error due to a parameter type change: `createDraft`, `updateDraft`, `replyMail`, `forwardMail`, `message`, and `draft`.  (148633307)\n\n### Background Assets\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The packaging tool (`ba-package`) and the mock server (`ba-serve`) crash immediately when the selected Xcode installation isn’t located at `\/Applications\/Xcode.app`.  (148927743)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- When running the mock server (`ba-serve`), the Choose Identity panel might appear behind all other windows and be absent in Mission Control.  (152256482)\n\n**Workaround:** Move all other windows out of the way to reveal the panel.\n\n### Build System\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Compilation caching has been introduced as an opt-in feature, which speeds-up iterative build\/test cycles for Swift and C-family languages. The compilation caching feature caches the results of compilations that were produced for a set of source file inputs and, when it detects that the same set of source files are getting re-compiled, it speeds-up the build by providing the prior compilation results directly from the cache. The workflows that will benefit the most from compilation caching are when switching between branches (which ends up re-compiling the same source files again) or when doing clean builds.\n\nCompilation caching can be enabled via “Enable Compilation Caching” build setting or via the per-user project settings.  (149700201)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Projects which have added support for the arm64e architecture may fail to build for the Simulator.  (123839235)\n- Fixed: When using synchronized group folders, the file order was non-deterministic, causing unnecessary rebuilds of the target from `xcodebuild` or after re-opening the Xcode project.  (151472630)\n- Fixed an issue which caused compilation to fail when compiler caching was enabled.  (153298732) (FB18022508)\n\n### C++ Standard Library\n\n#### New Features\n\n- The following C++26 features have been implemented:\n\n- `constexpr` placement new ([https:\/\/wg21.link\/P2747R2]) ([https:\/\/github.com\/llvm\/llvm-project\/issues\/105427])\n- A type trait for detecting virtual base classes ([https:\/\/wg21.link\/P2985R0]) ([https:\/\/github.com\/llvm\/llvm-project\/issues\/105432])\n\nThe following C++23 features have been implemented:\n\n- Relaxing Ranges Just A Smidge ([https:\/\/wg21.link\/P2609R3]) ([https:\/\/github.com\/llvm\/llvm-project\/issues\/105253])\n- A trait for implicit lifetime types ([https:\/\/wg21.link\/P2674R1]) ([https:\/\/github.com\/llvm\/llvm-project\/issues\/105259])\n- A Standard `flat_map` ([https:\/\/wg21.link\/P0429R9]) ([https:\/\/github.com\/llvm\/llvm-project\/issues\/105190])\n\nThe following C++20 features have been implemented:\n\n- Reviewing Deprecated Facilities of C++17 for C++20 ([https:\/\/wg21.link\/P0619R4]) ([https:\/\/github.com\/llvm\/llvm-project\/issues\/99985])\n\nPerformance and memory improvements:\n\n- The `lexicographical_compare` and `ranges::lexicographical_compare` algorithms have been optimized for trivially equality comparable types, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 40x.\n- The internal structure `__compressed_pair` has been replaced with `[[no_unique_address]]`, resulting in reduced compile times and smaller debug information as well as better code generation if optimizations are disabled.\n- The `input_iterator`-pair overload of `void assign(InputIt, InputIt)` has been optimized for `std::vector`, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 2x for trivial element types (e.g., `std::vector<int>`), and up to 3.4x for non-trivial element types (e.g., `std::vector<std::vector<int>>`).\n- The `input_iterator`-pair overload of `iterator insert(const_iterator, InputIt, InputIt)` has been optimized for `std::vector`, resulting in a performance improvement of up to 10x for `std::vector<int>`, and up to 2.3x for `std::vector<std::vector<int>>`.\n- `std::stable_sort` uses radix sort for integral types now, which can improve the performance up to 10 times, depending on type of sorted elements and the initial state of the sorted array.\n- Reduced the amount of debug information generated for internal typedefs. This reduces the size of debug builds.\n\nHardened libc++ related improvements:\n\n- The `_LIBCPP_ABI_BOUNDED_ITERATORS_IN_STD_ARRAY` ABI configuration was added, which allows storing valid bounds in `std::array::iterator` and detecting OOB accesses when the appropriate hardening mode is enabled.\n- The `_LIBCPP_ABI_BOUNDED_UNIQUE_PTR` ABI configuration was added, which allows `std::unique_ptr<T[]>` to detect out-of-bounds accesses in certain circumstances. `std::unique_ptr<T[]>` can now also detect out-of-bounds accesses for a limited set of types (non-trivially destructible types) when the ABI configuration is disabled.\n- Added ([https:\/\/libcxx.llvm.org\/Hardening.html#hardening]) support for `forward_list` and `bitset`.\n\nGeneral Improvements:\n\n- `std::jthread` and `<stop_token>` are not guarded behind `-fexperimental-library` anymore\n- The `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX20_REMOVED_TEMPORARY_BUFFER` macro has been added to make `std::get_temporary_buffer` and `std::return_temporary_buffer` available.\n- The `std::uncaught_exception` function was marked as deprecated since C++17 and removed since C++20. The `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX20_REMOVED_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION` macro has been added to make `std::uncaught_exception` available in C++20 and later modes.\n\nABI Affecting Changes:\n\n- The ABI breaks for removing undefined behavior in `std::forward_list`, `std::list`, `std::map`, `std::set`, `std::multimap`, `std::multiset`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multimap` and `std::unordered_multiset` are now applied unconditionally. This only affects fancy pointers which have a different value representation when pointing at the base of an internal node type instead of the type itself. A size or alignment difference is diagnosed, but more subtle ABI breaks may result in unexpected behavior.\n- The internal structure `__compressed_pair` has been replaced with `[[no_unique_address]]`. The ABI impact is:\n- When using the Itanium ABI (most non-MSVC platforms), empty types are now placed at the beginning of the enclosing object instead of where the beginning of the `__compressed_pair` subobject was. This is only observable by checking the address of the empty allocator, equality comparator or hasher.\n- Additionally, using an overaligned empty type as an allocator, comparator or hasher in the associative containers (and only those containers) may result in the container’s object size and data layout changing beyond only the address of the empty member.\n\n- The changes for `ranges::zip_view` from ([https:\/\/wg21.link\/P2165R4]) have been implemented. This changes the element type of `zip_view` from a `std::pair` to a `std::tuple` in some cases. This is technically an ABI break, however since `zip_view` is generally not an ABI sensitive type, we don’t expect users to encounter any issues and we don’t provide a way to change this behavior, which would make libc++ non-conforming.  (151879824)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- You may notice an ABI break of several Standard Library containers under very specific circumstances. Specifically, there are two ways to notice this ABI break:\n\n1. The size of std::unordered_{map,set,multimap,multiset} and std::deque changes when instantiated with an allocator type that is empty and contains a base class that is the same across rebound allocator instantiations (e.g. Allocator and Allocator are both empty and contain the same base class).\n2. The size of any user-defined type (say Foo) that has all of the following properties changes:\n\n- Foo contains a member of type std::unordered_{map,set,multimap,multiset}, std::deque, std::map, std::set, std::multimap, std::multiset, std::list or std::vector, and\n- Foo passes an empty allocator, comparator or hasher type to that container, and\n- Foo has a member of that same empty allocator, comparator or hasher type inside the enclosing type Foo, and\n- that member is either marked with [[no_unique_address]] or optimized out via the EBO (empty base optimization) technique. You can read more details about this issue here: https:\/\/github.com\/llvm\/llvm-project\/issues\/154985  (159096032)\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- The following items have been deprecated or removed:\n\n- The `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS` macro that was used to enable the safe mode has been removed in LLVM 20. Please use ([https:\/\/libcxx.llvm.org\/Hardening.html#hardening]) instead.\n- Support for the C++20 synchronization library (`<barrier>`, `<latch>`, `atomic::wait`, etc.) has been removed in language modes prior to C++20. If you are using these features prior to C++20, you will need to update to `-std=c++20`.\n- The relational operators for `std::chrono::weekday` have been removed entirely, and the `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_REMOVED_WEEKDAY_RELATIONAL_OPERATORS` macro is now ignored.\n- The `_LIBCPP_ENABLE_REMOVED_ALLOCATOR_CONST` macro no longer has any effect. `std::allocator<const T>` is not supported as an extension anymore, please migrate any code that uses e.g. `std::vector<const T>` to be standards conforming.\n- Non-conforming member typedefs `base`, `iterator`, `const_iterator`, `size_type`, `difference_type`, and `const_reference` of `std::bitset`, and member typedef `base` of `std::forward_list` and `std::list` are removed. Previously, these member typedefs (except `const_reference`) were private but could cause ambiguity in name lookup. Code that expects such ambiguity will possibly not compile in LLVM 20.\n- The function `__libcpp_verbose_abort()` is now `noexcept`, to match `std::terminate()`. (The combination of `noexcept` and `[[noreturn]]` has special significance for function effects analysis.) For backwards compatibility, the `_LIBCPP_VERBOSE_ABORT_NOT_NOEXCEPT` macro can be defined to make the function non-`noexcept`. That macro will be removed in LLVM 21.\n- `<ccomplex>`, `<cstdalign>` (previously missing), `<cstdbool>`, and `<ctgmath>` are deprecated since C++17 as specified by the standard. They, together with `<ciso646>`, are removed in C++20, but libc++ still provides these headers as an extension and only deprecates them. The `_LIBCPP_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS` macro can be defined to suppress deprecation for these headers.\n- The pointer safety functions `declare_reachable`, `declare_no_pointers`, `undeclare_no_pointers` and `__undeclare_reachable` have been removed from the library. These functions were never implemented in a non-trivial way, making it very unlikely that any binary depends on them.\n- Non-conforming extension `packaged_task::result_type` is deprecated. It will be removed in LLVM 21.\n- The changes for `ranges::zip_view` from ([https:\/\/wg21.link\/P2165R4]) have been implemented. This can lead to code assuming that `zip_view` produces `std::pair` to stop compiling now that it produces `std::tuple`. The cases are rare since `tuple` and `pair` are compatible for the most part, but this can lead to code that was previously accepted now being rejected. This is necessary for libc++ to be conforming, so we don’t provide any way to opt-out of that behavior.  (151880074)\n\n### Code Assistant\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Remote model configuration fields clear when Xcode loses focus.  (157071086)\n\n### Coding Intelligence\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Claude in Xcode is now available in the Intelligence settings panel, allowing users to seamlessly add their existing paid Claude account to Xcode and start using Claude Sonnet 4.  (155826755)\n- When using ChatGPT in Xcode, users can now start a new conversation with either GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, with GPT-5 set as the default.  (158342780)\n- ChatGPT in Xcode provides two model choices. “GPT-5” is optimized for quick, high-quality results, and should work well for most coding tasks. For difficult tasks, choose “GPT-5 (Reasoning)“, which spends more time thinking before responding, and can provide more accurate results for complex coding tasks.\n\nIn the OpenAI API, “GPT-5” corresponds to the “minimal” reasoning level, and “GPT-5 (Reasoning)” corresponds to the “low” reasoning level.  (159135374)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Files created by the coding assistant are not deleted when undoing the change.  (150298408)\n- Fixed: Models that are unavailable, have been deleted, or are disabled may continue to show as selected and available in existing conversations.  (151261617)\n- Fixed: When using Git LFS, restoring from a snapshot in modification history may fail.   (151396769)\n- Fixed: Coding intelligence features in Xcode require Apple Intelligence.   (151423060)\n- Fixed: Coding assistant may send a new message to a previous conversation after hiding and showing the navigator.    (151819331)\n- Fixed: The coding assistant can be disabled via device management in Xcode 26 Beta 6 by setting `CodingAssistantAllowExternalIntegrations` to false in a configuration profile with a `com.apple.dt.Xcode` `PayloadType`.  (152372875)\n- Fixed: Sometimes the coding assistant may appear empty after sending a message.    (152511782)\n- Fixed: Apple Intelligence must be turned on before launching Xcode to use coding intelligence features.  (152533281)\n- Fixed: Changes proposed by coding tools may not be applied if the lightning bolt icon in the coding assistant sidebar is disabled.  (153663434)\n- Fixed: Improved handling of very long files in Claude, which should lead to fewer errors indicating the context window has been depleted.  (154431550)\n- Fixed: The coding assistant and coding tools can now view and modify files created as Xcode Playgrounds.  (154907767)\n- Fixed: Coding intelligence features in Xcode have improved compatibility with popular third-party APIs using the “chat completions” format.  (155337963)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- When applying changes using coding intelligence, breakpoints in affected files may move.  (146888202)\n- When using coding intelligence, the model is unable to view or modify files with identical names simultaneously.   (147450585)\n- Previously deleted files may appear in the modification history as having been deleted by a recent coding assistant conversation.  (152545638)\n- Coding intelligence provides inconsistent results when modifying files that contain thousands of lines.   (152590014)\n- Users interacting with Claude in Xcode might receive an error message about their OAuth token being expired.  (159566701) (FB20014334)\n\n**Workaround:** Go to Settings → Intelligence → Claude in Xcode. Sign out. Restart Xcode. Sign back in.\n\n### Create ML App\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- Removed support for creating new Style Transfer projects.  (154135018)\n\n### Debugger\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Run action incorrectly launched a duplicate app instance when using SwiftUI Previews, or when running a command line app which opens windows using SDL, GLFW, or NSApplication APIs without being packaged as an app bundle.  (134287948) (FB14859622)\n- Fixed: The debugger is now able to follow a Swift Task when a step operation causes the Task to be migrated to a different thread.  (141825713)\n- Fixed: The payload of a Swift enum or Optional SBValue is now represented as a synthetic child rather than a direct child. Custom Python data formatters that unwrap Optional values continue to work with this change, as long as they do not turn SetPreferSyntheticValue() off.  (152662881)\n\n### Documentation\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The documentation viewer and Quick Help are missing documentation for PhotoKit and some SwiftUI symbols.  (158680915)\n\n### Editors\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: In Xcode 26 you can control when Editor Tabs are pinned and added. By default Xcode will only create tabs you ask for (File > New > Tab or Option+Click navigation). Automatic pinning is available in Xcode > Settings > Navigation > Pin Tabs Any Editor Tab can be pinned or unpinned by clicking the pin icon or using View > [Pin, Unpin] Editor Tab.  (135835457)\n- Fixed: The new Start Page in Xcode 26 provides the familiar Open Quickly queries and Related Items in an editor. The Start Page is shown for new Editor Tabs and new Editor Panes without other content. This can be configured in Xcode > Settings > Navigation.  (137163041)\n\n### Foundation\n\n#### New Features\n\n- The `#bundle` macro allows referring to the resource bundle associated with the current Xcode target. You can pass this to any Foundation API expecting a `Bundle`, such as when looking up images or localized strings.  (79247613)\n- NotificationCenter can post and observe new `Message` types with custom properties and isolation checking  (132023811)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `#bundle` does not refer to the correct resource bundle when used from a mergeable library.  (150698070)\n\n### GameKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- In addition to Leaderboards and Achievements, you can now also adopt, configure and modify Challenges and Activities directly in Xcode making it easier to enhance engagement in your game. Use Xcode to pull, modify and push Challenges and Activities updates to and from App Store Connect. The Game Progress Manager in Xcode allows you to test your Party Codes locally during development by modifying properties, reporting updates and resetting resources. These real-time updates can be used to verify that the Activity changed as expected.   (144816182)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Testing Party Codes in Game Progress Manager is currently only compatible with MacOS 16.0. Please upgrade your Mac software to use this functionality.  (144568615)\n- Fixed: Deep links within the Game Progress Manager are currently non-functional in Beta 2.    (153754027)\n- Fixed: Push and Pull to App Store Connect may fail.   (155814090)\n\n### Group Activities\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The DestinationVideo sample code doesn’t compile.  (147074640)\n\n**Workaround:** Replace `import GroupActivities` with `@preconcurrency import GroupActivities`.\n\n### Icon Composer\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: User supplied background images in Icon Composer are composited at the same scale as the 2048x2048 pixel icon renderings, and thus appear much smaller than expected.   (148133443)\n- Fixed: Exporting a single PNG, or using the “Copy Icon as Image” menu item, for Clear Light, Clear Dark, Tinted Light, or Tinted Dark will produce an unexpected dark image.   (148998556)\n- Fixed: Icon Composer icons back deploy to older versions of iOS, macOS, and watchOS with inconsistent rendering.  (152258860)\n- Fixed: Icon Composer icons added to macOS app targets do not display in Finder, Spotlight or Dock when deployed to older versions of macOS.  (154784104)\n\n### Instruments\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Target chooser has been redesigned from the ground up to improve the device and process selection experience. Changes include:\n\n- Move of the control from the toolbar to the Next Recording section, unifying all the settings relevant for the next run in one place.\n- Ability to filter available set of processes to launch or attach, including apps, launch agents and daemons.\n- Quick access to modify the environment or arguments for a process being launched by Instruments.  (79987176)\n- CPU Counters have been reworked to support a performance optimization methodology called Bottleneck Analysis, which uses preset modes that provide a “guided” path to using counters. The CPU Bottlenecks template configures the counters to initially break down sustainable CPU bandwidth into four broad categories:\n\n- Useful: CPU resources were used to make forward progress in your code\n- Instruction Delivery: the CPU could not provide enough instructions for processing\n- Instruction Processing: instructions are not executing quickly due to their relative cost or data not being ready\n- Discarded: incorrect speculative execution wasted bandwidth.\n\nEach category aside from Useful has one or more further recommended modes to narrow in on instruction sequences that are preventing the CPU from executing efficiently. There are also traditional modes that measure the characteristics of executed instructions or metrics about their execution, like the number of L1 Data Cache misses.\n\nManual mode for configuring Counters is still available and can be accessed from the instrument recording options.   (86470694)\n- Power Profiler is a new instrument designed to visualize system power usage and the power impact of an application on different subsystems like CPU, GPU or networking. To use the tool, drag it from the instruments library and record a trace on an iOS or iPadOS device. Process metrics are only present when using “Launch” or “Attach” recording modes in Instruments. Instruments also supports analysis of traces taken on-device using the Power Profiler feature in the Developer settings. To visualize captured trace, open the resulting .atrc file in Instruments, which will present both power data and CPU samples captured alongside.  (135759149)\n- The SwiftUI template has been updated with a next-generation SwiftUI instrument. The new instrument captures the duration of all of the updates SwiftUI performs, making it easy to identify long updates that may be negatively impacting app performance. It also tracks the causes of each update, allowing you to understand why view bodies are running, using the new Cause & Effect Graph.  (137637030)\n- Timeline content tooltips are now rendered in multiple lines when applicable.  (139212962)\n- Instruments General settings features a new “Attach Supporting files” toggle, allows Instruments to attach imported files or underlying Apple Trace files as part of the .trace container when enabled.  (144313007)\n- Added ability to name runs with `xctrace record` using `run-name` argument. Run names are presented when trace is subsequently opened in Instruments.  (144883457)\n- Animation Hitches Instrument has been redesigned to address correctness and performance issues. New version supports multiple displays across the platforms, includes application update intervals and more reliably reports hitching frames. Volume of recorded data has been reduced significantly, contributing to faster trace processing times.  (146033792)\n- Instruments Settings view has been redesigned for readability.  (146418991)\n- The Foundation Models instrument is a new tool designed to help developers profile their app’s usage of the FoundationModels framework. The instrument provides insights into the app’s requests and different phases, such as asset loading, prompt processing, and inference details. To use it, drag it from the Instruments library and record a new trace.  (148055761)\n- Call Tree has an ability to view all the aggregated samples using the “Focus” submenu for a node. The “Focus” button available on hover now defaults to showing the submenu with multiple actions instead of invoking “Focus on Subtree”.   (148098893)\n- Secondary clicking on a track in the timeline now offers a context menu with actions that allow for track pinning, copying represented value or adding it to various filters across the application.  (148666063)\n- Tracks in the timeline are now automatically sized to fit the plots inside. Tracks can still be resized manually using cursor or CMD+, CMD- keyboard shortcuts  (148943810)\n- Swift Concurrency template now surfaces names of tasks given using the new API available in Swift 6.2.  (149797014)\n- The source viewer now has a menu item in the “…” menu to be opened in the default editor for the file type, in addition to Xcode. The file name and icon can also be dragged out to open the file in another app. (FB18067130)  (151236418)\n- Backtraces will now be displayed for state changes when they are the only change in an update group  (152202531)\n- A new “Show View Hierarchy” action in summaries of updates in the SwiftUI instrument allows you to quickly identify where in your view hierarchy updates to particular views are happening  (154238501)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Copy of unsymbolicated frames from a call tree view now includes names of libraries.  (141645741)\n- Fixed: Copy and Copy with Header actions are now properly handled in the aggregation detail views across Instruments.  (146333462)\n- Fixed: Resolves a large memory leak happening when recording with the User Space Sampler Instrument.  (146506463)\n- Fixed issues with the metric calculation in the CPU Counters Instrument happening during thread context switches  (147776170)\n- Fixed: Set Inspection Range and Zoom action is now available as a standalone menu item instead of an alternate.   (149986438)\n- Fixed an issue where pinned timeline wouldn’t be sized appropriately when presented.  (150055669)\n- Fixed: Main menu of Instruments has been simplified. Document menu has been removed and its actions have been moved under `View`.   (150067894)\n- Fixed: Pause \/ Resume button has been removed from the toolbar. It is still present in the main menu of the application.  (150984980)\n- Fixed an issue where resizing the timeline track by dragging would sometimes get stuck or not be responsive to user’s action.  (151040978)\n- Fixed: Plot titles in the timeline will now show tooltips when the text is truncated.  (151046422)\n- Fixed: The left side of the call tree showing weights could have unexpected column resizing behavior, and the text in the columns may not be horizontally aligned.   (151710652)\n- Fixed: Recordings using the SwiftUI instrument of an app that accesses a property from an @Observable class a large number of times could take an extremely long time to process after the recording ends  (153239266) (FB17998165)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- No data is present when recording the CPU Counters on macOS devices in the “Streaming SME Bottlenecks” or “Instruction Processing Bottlenecks” modes.  (152179757)\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- Support for profiling WatchKit 1.0 applications has been removed.  (139213888)\n- The Zombies template has been removed. To record Zombies, select the “Allocations” template and enable the “Enable NSZombie detection” checkbox.  (146791790)\n- The SceneKit template has been removed. SceneKit Instrument remains available in the library.  (146791805)\n- Previous SwiftUI template containing View Body and View Properties Instruments have been replaced. The instruments are now deprecated and still available in the instruments library.  (148596828)\n\n### Interface Builder\n\n#### New Features\n\n- The “Show Library” button (”+”) has been moved from the main toolbar to the bar at the bottom of the Interface Builder canvas.  (152549110)\n- Interface Builder adds a “Control Metrics” property in the File inspector for Mac XIB and Storyboard documents. On macOS 26, this will set `prefersCompactControlSizeMetrics` on views in the canvas so they can be designed for environments where `prefersCompactControlSizeMetrics` will be set at runtime.  (154597312) (FB18476246)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Downloaded Metal Toolchain may appear unavailable in Xcode when building metal projects.  (153096694)\n- Fixed: Fix an issue with the xcrun cache not refreshing after the metal toolchain is downloaded when running `xcrun -f metal`.  (154682120)\n\n### Localization\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Xcode can now generate type-safe Swift symbols for manually-managed strings in String Catalogs. For example, a string in Localizable.xcstrings with key “Landmarks” and value “%(count)lld landmarks” can be accessed via `LocalizedStringResource.landmarks(count: 42)`. You can enable this via the build setting “Generate String Catalog Symbols”.  (110427968) (FB12264530)\n- The String Catalog Editor now supports selecting and performing actions on multiple strings at once.  (110457331) (FB12271972)\n- Xcode can now use source code context to generate translation comments in a String Catalog. Use “Generate Comment” in the context menu to generate comments for existing strings. To ensure newly-extracted strings get comments by default, turn on “Automatically generate string catalog comments” in Settings > Editing. This requires Xcode’s on-device predictive code completion model.  (111708155)\n- The Refactor menu in String Catalogs and the Source Editor now lets you change a string key across all code files and String Catalogs.  (129261942)\n- A new Refactor menu in the String Catalog Editor allows converting one or more strings between automatically-extracted string literals and manually-managed strings referenced via Swift symbols. This allows you to update source code at the same time as making String Catalog changes. These operations are also accessible via the Refactor menu in the Source Editor.  (129261981)\n- Expressive Format Specifiers in String Catalogs allow you to add a name to any format specifier. For example, `%(landmarkCount)lld` clearly communicates that the integer passed in at runtime represents a count of landmarks. These format specifiers will be included in the exported Localization Catalog (.xcloc) to help guide translators.  (136543666)\n- When typing “%” in a String Catalog, an auto-completion menu suggests relevant format specifiers for your string.  (139033592)\n- The String Catalog filter bar now allows filtering for strings with generated comments and strings using symbol generation.  (151563807)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: String Catalog files using comment generation or symbol generation JSON fields will auto-update their version number to 1.1.  (153395850) (FB18060389)\n- Fixed: Improved quality of String Catalog generated comments, including more detailed argument descriptions.  (154779538)\n- Fixed: String Catalogs now remember your preferred column sizes.  (156604245)\n\n### Metal\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Metal Debugger in Xcode 26 has been updated to support Metal 4 in most debugging workflows. This includes support for Machine Learning tensor visualization, Machine Learning graph visualization and debugging, and an updated Dependency Viewer that now also visualizes per stage dependencies.  (136174499)\n- Metal System Trace in Instruments has been updated to support Metal 4  (136242467)\n- Metal Debugger in Xcode 26 has been updated with the ability to export performance data into a GPU Trace that can be later visualized in Xcode using the same or a different Mac, without the need to replay the trace.  (137163147)\n- Metal Debugger in Xcode 26 has been updated with improved profiling workflows. This includes a new Summary tab that shows an overview of the profiling session, a new Shaders tab providing statistics for shaders in the trace, and an updated visualization for counters in the GPU Timeline.  (137242382)\n- Metal Performance HUD has been updated with new metrics and an enhanced user interface that supports customization.  It also now has the ability to identify performance insights and generate performance reports for games running natively or within the evaluation environment.  (151481481)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Compiling Metal shaders with the latest Xcode 26 Metal toolchain for iOS 18, macOS 15, tvOS 18, and visionOS 2 deployment targets may not produce valid GPU binaries.   (150887778)\n- Fixed: Xcodebuild may fail to find the downloaded metal toolchain when building a project with metal shaders by command line.  (152810434)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- GPU Profiling in Metal Debugger is not available for Metal 4.  (136244517)\n- Metal 4 Sparse resources are not supported in Metal Debugger.  (136326816)\n- Shader Debugging in Metal Debugger is not available for Metal 4.  (136626557)\n\n### Objective-C Runtime\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Concurrent mutation of nonatomic properties in Objective-C will now sometimes produce more actionable crashes. Synthesized setters will briefly store the sentinel value 0x400000000000bad0 (0xbad0 on 32-bit watchOS) which may be read by another thread accessing the property unsafely. A crash on this sentinel value indicates a thread safety issue with the property it came from.  (148109501)\n\n### Organizer\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Metric recommendations are now available for the launch time metric in the Xcode Organizer. When there is enough information, the Organizer will display a recommended value for a metric on the chart associated with your app’s metrics. Use this data to plan and prioritize performance engineering work.  (141243138)\n\n### Playground Macros\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Playground macros currently cause a build failure saying that `Playgrounds` cannot be found when built for Mac Catalyst.  (151029441)\n\n### Playgrounds\n\n#### New Features\n\n- `#Playground` in Xcode now allows for filing feedback for Foundation Models framework responses.  (154165221)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Pinned #Playground blocks do not execute properly.  (150710099)\n- Fixed: Playground macro requires macOS 15.5 or later.  (152008152)\n- Fixed: Xcode playgrounds with auxiliary Swift sources fail to compile.  (154373965)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Canvas doesn’t show results for #Playground blocks in “Legacy Previews Execution”.  (150811580)\n\n### Predictive Code Completion\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Xcode features like Predictive Code Completion and Coding Assistant may require Apple Intelligence to be enabled.   (152113360)\n\n### Previews\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Previews could fail to find libraries linked through symlinked paths in some cases. This should be resolved.  (142639854) (FB16276100)\n- Fixed: Previewing code that used libraries asserting they were loaded on the main thread could crash. Previews now runs library initializers on the main thread.  (145534532) (FB16599189)\n- Fixed: Previews now handles static libraries that were resulting in a “does not contain an archive” error message. If you find an example of this that still is not resolved, please file a feedback and attach the static library for analysis.  (146364028) (FB16747894)\n- Fixed: Previews now works better with weak linked libraries on recent OSes.  (146794084)\n- Fixed: Previews could fail when targeting a physical device if the path to derived data crossed a symlink. This is now resolved.  (149032016)\n- Fixed: Compilation caching should now work with Previews. Please file feedback with Previews diagnostics if you see any issues.  (152327895)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- When switching between visionOS previews, it is possible to get a momentary “Resource Invalidation” error. This can be worked around by just resuming the preview by clicking the resume button or pressing Command-Option-P.  (158613019)\n\n### Project Editor\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: There is an issue with the “+ Capability” button not showing any capabilities even though the Signing & Capabilities editor is showing.  (151898543)\n\n### Reality Composer Pro\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The Send to Device toolbar item down arrow does not draw correctly.   (147957053)\n- Fixed: For new Reality Composer Pro projects, in the issue navigator you may see an error such as “Package realitykitcontent is using Swift tools version 6.2.0 but the installed version is 6.0.0.”  (152502442)\n\n### RealityKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- RealityKit is not supported on the Apple TV HD (4th generation).  (145292590)\n- RealityKit is available from tvOS 19.0 and supports all Apple TV 4K models.  (145952172)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `ParticleEmitterComponent` does not render properly on iOS, macOS, and tvOS.  (152201501)\n\n### SceneKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- The scntool CLI now supports converting SCN files (including animations) to USD formats.  (148582191)\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- SceneKit is now deprecated across all Apple platforms. Developers can continue to use SceneKit in their projects, but no new features or optimizations are coming to this framework. For new projects, Apple recommends using RealityKit.  (147454720)\n\n### Security\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Xcode now provides an “Enhanced Security” extension template, which you can use to separate sensitive calculations, such as handling data from untrusted sources, into an extension that the system runs as a separate process from your app. For more information see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/xcode\/creating-enhanced-security-helper-extensions].  (141308470)\n- Xcode now provides an “Enhanced Security” capability, which enables additional runtime and compile-time protections for your application and builds it with pointer authentication enabled. For more information see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/xcode\/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app].  (143278278)\n- Clang now supports a language extension for C, `-fbounds-safety`,  that guarantees bounds safety. The extension also provides bounds annotations that you can use to specify bounds information for pointers and arrays. The compiler informs you where to add bounds annotations through errors and warnings and automatically inserts guaranteed bounds checks at run time. To enable this extension, set the `ENABLE_CLANG_BOUNDS_SAFETY` build setting to `YES`. For more information see -fbounds-safety: Enforcing bounds safety for C﻿.  (149099879)\n- Clang now supports a strict programming model that guarantees bounds safety in C++ by rejecting raw pointer arithmetic and requiring the use of hardened C++ Standard Library APIs for buffer manipulation. To enable this mode set the `ENABLE_CPLUSPLUS_BOUNDS_SAFE_BUFFERS` build setting to `YES`.  (150517840)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The Enhanced Security capability options in Xcode to enable platform restrictions and read-only platform memory do not add those protections and instead adds entitlements that have no effect.    (152059695)\n\n### Simulator\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The visionOS Simulator now uses a 4K resolution when running visionOS 3.0.  (121031014)\n\n### Simulators\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Installing apps from Xcode to a simulator, when build products or the simulator runtime are located in non-standard locations or on non-APFS filesystems may fail.  (152938778) (FB17867688)\n\n### Source Control\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue where workspaces touching git repositories with many tags or branches might experience sudden hangs or spins.  (144901032)\n\n### Source Editor\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Predictive Code Completion in Xcode now supports progressively accepting completions in   smaller segments by holding the `^` key.  (137459125)\n- An annotation displaying the #if condition is displayed at the end of a line starting with #endif. The annotation will only be visible if there are no #else or #elseif branches.  (143072375)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Resolved several major performance issues related to syntax highlighting in Swift files.  (144533425)\n- Fixed: The fonts and colors are incorrectly stored in the themes files.  (152506293)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Change bars may be out of date when reverting changes from the coding assistant.   (152399120)\n\n### Swift\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Starting from Xcode 26, Swift explicit modules will be the default mode for building all Swift targets. When encountering severe issues, projects could opt-out of Swift explicit modules by specifying a build setting SWIFT_ENABLE_EXPLICIT_MODULES=NO.  (125244407)\n- Fixed: When building projects using Swift language versions prior to Swift 5, Swift explicit modules remains to be disabled by default.  (146404229)\n- Fixed: Swift explicit modules hasn’t been enabled by default for project targets that use Swift\/C++ interoperability.  (152118892)\n- Fixed: `Observations` is not available.  (152888116)\n- Fixed: `Data.bytes` and other `Span` API is not available.   (152888512)\n\n### Swift Compiler\n\n#### New Features\n\n- MutableSpan may now be passed as an inout function parameter without enabling an experimental feature.  (150557314)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Some incorrect uses of Span and MutableSpan do not produce compile errors. This may result in unexpected program behavior.  (150275147)\n- Fixed: Some incorrect uses of Span and MutableSpan do not produce compile errors. This may result in unexpected program behavior.  (150403948)\n\n### Swift Interoperability with C\/C++\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Swift compiler now automatically infers `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` annotation for C++ types inheriting from a base that is annotated with  `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE`. The derived type is imported as a Swift class or reference-counted type with the same `retain` and `release` operations as the base type.  (97914474)\n- You can now annotate C and C++ functions with bounds and lifetime annotations that enable Swift to import them without the need for unsafe boilerplate. This feature is currently experimental. To enable it, add the `-enable-experimental-feature SafeInteropWrappers` to your `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS` build setting.\n\nAdd `__noescape` to a C or C++ function parameter to indicate that the parameter doesn’t escape the function. If you annotate a parameter of `std::span` type with `__noescape`, the compiler generates a safe overload that directly takes a Span in Swift.\n\nAdd `__lifetimebound` on a C or C++ function parameter to indicate that the return value of the function does not outlive the objects referred to by that parameter. If you annotate a parameter with `__lifetimebound` and the return value is of `std::span` type, the compiler will generate a safe overload that directly returns a Span.\n\nYou can annotate raw C and C++ pointers with these lifetime annotation and also with bounds annotations, such as `__counted_by(N)`, which indicate that the raw pointer points to memory containing at least `N` elements. If you add both a lifetime annotation and a bounds annotation to a raw pointer in a function parameter, Swift will import it as a Span. Here is an example:\n\n```\n  \/\/ C\/C++\n  #include <lifetimebound.h>\n  #include <ptrcheck.h>\n  void initializeBuffer(int * __counted_by(len) p __noescape, size_t len);\n         \n  \/\/ Unsafe overload in Swift\n  func initializeBuffer(_ p: UnsafeMutablePointer<CInt>, _ len: Int)\n         \n  \/\/ Safe overload in Swift\n  func initializeBuffer(_ p: inout MutableSpan<CInt>)\n```\n\nNote that the safe overload of initializeBuffer doesn’t contain a separate len parameter because MutableSpan already contains its count.\n\nSimilarly, if you annotate a parameter with  `__lifetimebound` and annotate a function return type with a bounds annotation, Swift will import the return type as a Span.\n\nFor `void *` or pointers to type with an unknown size, you can use the `__sized_by(N)`  bounds annotation which indicates that the pointer points to memory of at least `N` bytes.  (97942270)\n- Constructors of C++ `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types are now callable from Swift as initializers, allowing these types to be constructed directly from Swift.  (131557219)\n- Objective-C and Objective-C++ APIs that return C++ `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types can now be annotated with `SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED` or `SWIFT_RETURNS_UNRETAINED` annotations.  (135360972)\n- C++ classes can be annotated with `SWIFT_PRIVATE_FILEID` to allow Swift extensions of those classes to access their `private` and `protected` members. This annotation is defined in the `swift\/bridging` header and takes a fileID as its argument (e.g., `SWIFT_PRIVATE_FILEID(\"MyModule\/MyFile.swift\")`). For C++ classes with this annotation, non-`public` members are treated as if they were defined as `private` in the Swift source file designated by the fileID.  (137764620)\n- Objective-C and Objective-C++ functions and methods that return C++ `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types can now use the new `SwiftReturnOwnership:` API Notes attribute to specify ownership. Set the value to `retained` or `unretained` to apply the corresponding `SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED` or `SWIFT_RETURNS_UNRETAINED` annotation.  (142504115)\n- You can now annotate function parameters and return values of clang modules with bounds attributes using APINotes. This lets you create safe Swift interfaces when using the SafeInteropWrappers feature without modifying the headers of external modules. Example:\n\n```\n \/\/ C header\n void foo(int * p, size_t len);\n void * bar(size_t size, size_t count);\n \n \/\/ APINotes\n Name: MyBoundsModule\n Functions:\n   - Name: foo\n     Parameters:\n       - Position: 0\n         BoundsSafety:\n           Kind: counted_by\n           BoundedBy: \"len\"\n   - Name: bar\n     BoundsSafety:\n       Kind: sized_by\n       BoundedBy: \"size * count\"\n```\n\n(143701027)\n- The `SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED` and `SWIFT_RETURNS_UNRETAINED` annotations can now be applied to C++ APIs with templated return types.  (143732201)\n- C++ `std::string` now conforms to Swift `ExpressibleByStringInterpolation`  (147249169)\n- The Swift compiler no longer emits a warning for C++ functions and methods that return `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types without an explicit `SWIFT_RETURNS_RETAINED` or `SWIFT_RETURNS_UNRETAINED` annotation.  (150937617)\n- Static C++ factory functions returning `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types are now imported as Swift initializers, as long as they are annotated with `SWIFT_NAME(\"init(_:_:_:)\")`, with the underscore placeholders matching the factory function’s parameter count.  (152457366)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Swift compiler would sometimes generate a C++ header for a Swift module that had nested types declared out of order, causing compilation errors.  (147882976)\n- Fixed: Enabling the safe Swift\/C++\/C interoperation feature can cause a compilation error when used in a project with an older deployment target where Span isn’t available.  (150740330)\n- Fixed: With the safe Swift\/C++\/C interoperation feature enabled, annotating a return pointer with `__sized_by` causes a compilation error.  (151799287)\n- Fixed: With the safe Swift\/C++\/C interoperation feature enabled, annotating a return pointer with both `__counted_by` and `_Nullable` causes a compilation error.  (151804085)\n\n### Swift Macros Build Performance\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Build for Swift macro targets is accelerated by downloading a prebuilt library for swift-syntax from `swift.org` and integrating it into the build. This feature is enabled automatically and will improve build times for these projects.  (151701829)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: You may experience build failures when building projects with Swift macro dependencies. Common symptom is a build failure around `_SwiftSyntaxCShims`. You can work around this by disabling the swift-syntax prebuilts for macros feature. Quit Xcode. Issue the command `defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEPackageEnablePrebuilts NO` at the command line. Clean out the DerivedData for the project in `~\/Library\/Developer\/Xcode\/DerivedData`. Restart Xcode and execute the build.  (152253497)\n- Fixed: In a project that uses macros and when using the Legacy Preview Execution for Canvas, builds will fail when building for preview. You can work around this by disabling the swift-syntax prebuilts for macros feature. Quit Xcode. Issue the command `defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEPackageEnablePrebuilts NO` at the command line. Clean out the DerivedData for the project in `~\/Library\/Developer\/Xcode\/DerivedData`. Restart Xcode and execute the build.  (152443472)\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\n#### New Features\n\n- `swift test` now accepts an `--attachments-path` argument for specifying a directory where attachments should be saved when using Swift Testing. See [https:\/\/github.com\/swiftlang\/swift-evolution\/blob\/main\/proposals\/testing\/0009-attachments.md].  (147753584)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `.treatAllWarnings` and `.treatWarning` target APIs in SwiftPM package manifests are missing.  (152340059)\n- Fixed: `swift package migrate` fails with an “expected string” error.  (152533205)\n\n### Swift Packages\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Xcode 26 contains a preview of a new implementation for Swift package builds based on shared code with Swift Package Manager, which will improve consistency and stability of builds across Swift Package Manager and Xcode and will become the default in a future release. To try the new implementation, set the user default: `defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEEnableNewPackagePIFBuilder -bool YES` and please report any issues or differences in behavior via Feedback Assistant.  (132025293)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue where the Add Package assistant would occasionally not load if you had a private package from GitHub in your list of recently used packages.  (136229497) (FB15166959)\n- Fixed: Edits made to local package dependencies are incorporated into subsequent builds.  (140069965) (FB15863852)\n- Fixed: Xcode projects with packages might not build correctly after project reloading.  (155537249)\n\n### Swift Splash\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The Swift Splash sample app may crash on launch.  (155922631)\n\n### Test Report\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: XCUIElementQuery suggestions in the Automation Explorer are more accurate and concise when there are multiple similar elements in the UI hierarchy.  (133085864)\n\n### Testing\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Swift Testing now supports exit tests which allow you to test code that calls `precondition()` or `fatalError()` or might otherwise terminate the test process.  (126206192)\n- New UI Test Recording experience. To start recording UI interactions, navigate to the test case function and click the record button at the edge of the editor.  (135593667)\n- Swift Testing now supports attaching files or data to help diagnose test failures. Attachments are shown in Xcode’s Test Report and included in .xcresult bundles. ([https:\/\/github.com\/swiftlang\/swift-evolution\/blob\/main\/proposals\/testing\/0009-attachments.md])  (139098583)\n- Runtime issue detection in Swift Testing and XCTest.  When running tests through Xcode and xcodebuild users will be notified of runtime issues that occur during their tests.  This detection can be configured in the Test Plan by either promoting the runtime issues to failures or turning them off.  (141704793)\n- Swift Testing’s `ConditionTrait` type now includes an `evaluate()` method which evaluates its underlying condition, allowing these traits to be composed more easily. (ST-0010)  (142690932)\n- The total number of arguments passed to a parameterized Swift Testing test function is now shown in its console output message when it finishes.  (144250498)\n- The `xcodebuild build-for-testing` command now includes information about disabled test plan configurations in generated `.xctestrun` files. Disabled test plan configurations are not run by default, but may be run selectively by passing the `-only-test-configuration <name>` flag one or more times to `xcodebuild test-without-building`.  (144809893)\n- When verbose output is enabled, a console message will be printed each time an invocation of a parameterized Swift Testing test function finishes including its pass\/fail status and the total number of issues it recorded.  (146863942)\n- API added to XCTest for creating non failing issues.  Test Authors can create a `XCTIssue` with a severity level as warning in order to record a non failing issue.  In order to handle these non failing issues we also added API on `XCTIssue` to determine if the issue `isFailure`.  (148547346)\n- Swift Testing includes a new trait for customizing how recorded issues are handled. To transform or observe the issues recorded by a test or suite, apply `.compactMapIssues { … }`, or to conditionally suppress issues, apply `.filterIssues { … }`. ([https:\/\/github.com\/swiftlang\/swift-evolution\/blob\/main\/proposals\/testing\/0011-issue-handling-traits.md])  (150057037)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Test diamonds shown in the source editor no longer disappear after changing branches or otherwise modifying Xcode’s project file.  (109443495)\n- Fixed: If a parameterized Swift Testing test function includes two or more arguments that either don’t have a stable representation (e.g. they don’t conform to `Codable` or any other supported protocol) or have an identical stable representation, they will each now run even if parallelization is enabled. Previously this situation could crash, and most often affected arguments which had equal values for their `description` property.  (121455205)\n- Fixed: Comments passed to the `withKnownIssue` family of APIs are now displayed in the Test Report next to the known issue.  (126711065)\n- Fixed: If an issue is recorded during an invocation of a parameterized Swift Testing test function, and then the arguments of the failing run are modified and the issue is resolved upon rerun, the outdated issues will be removed from the Issue navigator and source editor.  (134298578)\n- Fixed: When an expectation such as `#expect(...)` fails, the amount of automatically-collected data representing its subexpressions is now limited to avoid poor performance when a value references a large object or collection.  (138208832)\n- Fixed: When a Swift.org toolchain is selected via the “Xcode > Toolchains” menu, the copy of Swift Testing in that toolchain may not be used when running tests which may cause launch failures.  (148853997)\n- Fixed: Attachments are not recorded from within the bodies of exit tests when using Swift Testing.  (149242118)\n- Fixed: Swift Testing no longer crashes if an expectation such as `#expect` has an empty comment.  (149482060)\n- Fixed: Modules which use Swift Testing and enable the Strict Memory Safety feature introduced in Swift 6.2 encounter memory safety diagnostics from `@Test`, `@Suite`, and other macros.  (151238560)\n- Fixed: Using a Swift.org toolchain in Xcode may cause build errors in targets that use Swift Testing due to an incompatible macro plugin being selected.  (151799859)\n- Fixed: When an expectation such as `#expect(...)` has `try` or `await` keywords before it, code comments on the preceding lines are now collected.  (151825393)\n- Fixed: The `@Test` macro no longer produces a compilation error in contexts where there is a concrete type named `Actor`.  (152039067)\n- Fixed: Swift Testing tests and suites whose names use raw identifiers (introduced in [https:\/\/github.com\/swiftlang\/swift-evolution\/blob\/main\/proposals\/0451-escaped-identifiers.md]) can now be run selectively via Xcode’s Test navigator or source editor diamonds, as well as included or excluded in test plans.  (152524780)\n- Fixed: When observing the standard output or standard error stream of an exit test, the `standardOutputContent` and `standardErrorContent` properties of `ExitTest.Result`, respectively, no longer contain unrelated logging from XCTest.  (153326967) (FB18033664)\n- Fixed: When applying the `.serialized` trait to a parameterized Swift Testing `@Test` function directly, its cases will be executed serially.  (154529146)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Swift Testing exit tests may produce crash logs in \/Library\/.  (47982238)\n\n### Xcode\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Xcode Previews usage frequently panics on macOS 26.0 Tahoe beta 4.   (141641869)\n\n### Xcode Cloud\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Resolved an issue that could prevent Xcode Cloud from automatically navigating to a newly started build.
