The Xcode 16.4 release supports on-device debugging in iOS 15 and later, tvOS 15 and later, watchOS 7 and later, and visionOS. Xcode 16.4 requires a Mac running macOS Sequoia 15.3 through macOS Tahoe 26.1.\n\n### General\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Users may see excessive CPU utilization from diskimagesiod which reduces simulator performance, increasing boot time, process launch times, and test execution times.  (146716769) (FB16818022)\n\n### Apple Clang Compiler\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The base template for `std::char_traits` is restored after being removed in Xcode 16.3; it is still deprecated and is going to be removed in a future release. Restoring the base template allows code that attempts to instantiate `char_traits` with types that are not provided by the Standard (for example, `std::basic_string<long long>` and similar) to still compile, giving it more time to transition.   (149025504)\n\n### Device\n\n#### New Features\n\n- The command `devicectl diagnose` now obtains a sysdiagnose from your Mac and all available devices by default.  (104845318)\n\n### Instruments\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Improved error handling for the Processor Trace Instrument when targeting binary not signed with get-task-allow entitlement.   (139032322)\n\n### Simulator\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: NSURLSession was always timing out and failing in iOS 18.3 simulator runtimes.   (147849952) (FB17006003)\n\n### Source Editor\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Some C++ headers were experiencing crashes in syntax highlighting and Quick Help.
