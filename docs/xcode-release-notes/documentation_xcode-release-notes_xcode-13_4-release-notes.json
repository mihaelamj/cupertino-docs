The Xcode 13.4 release supports on-device debugging for iOS 15.5, iPadOS 15.5, tvOS 15.4, watchOS 8.5, and later. Xcode 13.4 requires a Mac running macOS Monterey 12 or later.\n\n### Build System\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Swift Playgrounds app projects with package dependencies fail to build for Mac Catalyst when a package specifies `.iOS(...)` in its `platforms` array in the manifest, but doesn’t specify `.macCatalyst(...)`. (88726762)\n\n**Workaround**: Add `.macCatalyst(...)` to the `platforms` array with the same value as the `iOS(...)` entry.\n\n### Devices\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Xcode 13.4 is unable to prepare devices running iOS 15.6 beta for development. (93452791)\n\n**Workaround**: Use Xcode 13.3.1.\n\n### Localization\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue where Xcode was sometimes unable to build or close after failing to export localizations. (91161985)\n\n### Reality Composer\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Using the Reality Composer app or previewing Reality Composer projects in Xcode may lead to a crash on Mac systems with AMD GPU: MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016), MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019), iMac Pro (2017). (92637801)\n\n**Workaround**: Use Xcode 13.3.\n\n### Signing and Distribution\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue with generating symbols for Quick Look plug-ins during app distribution. (91361932)\n\n### Source Control\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Users can’t onboard with an Apple ID that hasn’t been upgraded to use two-factor authentication. (92041517)\n\n**Workaround**: Upgrade your Apple ID to use two-factor authentication.\n- The workflow editor doesn’t show test plans for schemes that have been recently converted to test plans. (92053036)\n\n**Workaround**: Convert to test plans, commit and push your changes to your remote repository before onboarding.\n\n### Swift\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a compiler issue that caused a runtime crash in `NativeSet` when back deploying to iOS 15.3 or earlier. (90666260)\n- The async version of `addTeardownBlock` method in `XCTestCase` is now available. (90665371)\n- Closures that are guaranteed to run on the main actor are now permitted to reference local variables from their enclosing scopes that are also running on the main actor.\n\n```swift\n@MainActor\nclass MyController: UIViewController {\n  var isExcited: Bool = false\n  \n  func doSomething() {\n    var title = \"Hello\"\n\n    Task { @MainActor in\n      if isExcited { \/\/ okay, accessing main actor-isolated stored property\n        title += \"!\" \/\/ okay, accessing main actor-isolated local variable\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(90665432)\n\n### Swift Packages\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a bug that prevented Swift Packages from finding a package plug-in tool if a target in a different package than the plug-in that requires it built the tool. (90650826)\n\n### Testing\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Xcode crashes if you attempt to run unit or UI tests for watchOS apps when the Run scheme action’s executable is set to None. (74928871)\n\n**Workaround**: Set the Run scheme action’s executable to a valid WatchKit app target built by the scheme.\n\n## Xcode 13\n\n- **Xcode 13.4.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 13.3.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 13.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 13.2.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 13.2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 13.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 13 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
