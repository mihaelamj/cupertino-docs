The Xcode 14.3.1 release supports on-device debugging in iOS 11 and later, tvOS 11 and later, and watchOS 4 and later. Xcode 14.3.1 requires a Mac running macOS Ventura 13.0 or later.\n\n### General\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: When targeting devices running iOS 13, apps built with Xcode 14.3 and using Objective-C protocols from Swift, sometimes crash at launch. (108930834)\n\n### Asset Catalogs\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: iOS app icons, including alternate app icons, weren’t correctly populating `Info.plist` entries for iPad. This made alternate app icons specified using Single Size erroneously unavailable on iPad at runtime. (108955499)\n\n### Playgrounds\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Playground live views weren’t updating correctly after making changes to the Playground code. (108413386)\n- Fixed: Xcode could crash on macOS 13.3 when adding a new page to a playground. (108952884)\n\n### Swift\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Applications using Swift Concurrency could crash when run on a specific OS version:\n\n- macOS 12.0 up to (but not including) macOS 12.1\n- iOS 15.0 up to (but not including) iOS 15.2\n- tvOS 15.0 up to (but not including) tvOS 15.2\n- watchOS 8.0 up to (but not including) watchOS 8.3\n\nEarlier and later OS versions weren’t affected. (108837762)\n\n### Swift Packages\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Custom commands implemented by package plugins aren’t being shown in the context menu for Xcode projects.
