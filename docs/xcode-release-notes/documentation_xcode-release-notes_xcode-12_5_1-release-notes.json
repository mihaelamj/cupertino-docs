The Xcode 12.5.1 release supports on-device debugging for iOS 9 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 12.5.1 requires a Mac running macOS Big Sur 11 or later.\n\n### Debugging\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Improved the performance of the Variables View in very large projects. (75381959, 78035413)\n\n### Signing and Distribution\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Resolved an issue in which Xcode failed to `codesign` using a smart card. (78035219)\n\n### Source Control\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- When you select Upload Key after you clone a repository from a source control provider and associate a locally-generated key with that repository, Xcode doesn’t upload the key. (78824500)\n\n**Workaround**: Add the key using the source control provider’s website.\n\n### Swift Packages\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue where `swift build` exited silently when building a program with package dependencies and a large compiler crash output. (77558631)\n- Fixed an issue where command-line builds of packages sometimes didn’t print a “Build complete!” message. (77669218)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Authentication may fail when using Xcode Server with Swift Packages. (77331504)\n\n**Workaround**: Add `-scmProvider xcode` to the `xcodebuild` arguments in the bot’s configuration.\n\n### Testing\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue which caused XCTest UI Recording to not emit automation code in iOS, tvOS, or watchOS. (77511696) (FB9096691)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- UI interruption monitors don’t work in watchOS. (59571331)\n- UI Test Recording fails to generate code for iOS Simulator targets if recording starts after code execution stops at a breakpoint. (77924295)\n\n**Workaround**: With no breakpoint set, place your cursor within a test method and press the record button.\n\n## Xcode 12\n\n- **Xcode 12.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 12.4 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 12.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 12.2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 12.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 12.0.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 12 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
