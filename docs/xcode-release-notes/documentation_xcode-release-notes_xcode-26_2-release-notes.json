Xcode 26.2 beta 2 supports on-device debugging in iOS 15 and later, tvOS 15 and later, watchOS 8 and later, and visionOS. Xcode 26.2 beta 2 requires a Mac running macOS Sequoia 15.6 or later.\n\n### Coding Intelligence\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Users interacting with ChatGPT in Xcode might experience performance issues when the assistant is applying code changes.  (163507099)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Users interacting with ChatGPT in Xcode may not receive previews of sample code.  (164573607)\n\n**Workaround:** Clicking the copy button allows you to access the contents of the sample code.\n\n### Instruments\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Instruments would sometimes fail to automatically find a dSYM for a profiled binary, resulting in lack of symbols in the trace.  (126836231)\n- Fixed: Environment updates would show up in the cause and effect graph as multiple nodes instead of being logically grouped  (161448568)\n- Fixed: Resolved an issue that would result in longer than expected load times for deferred mode recordings of all processes on an attached device.  (162242393)\n- Fixed: The Allocations instrument sometimes fails to report reference counting operations for native Swift types.  (163080666)\n- Fixed: After focusing on a subtree, the Call Tree\/Flame Graph toggle may not be clickable  (163147572)\n- Fixed a crash that would occur when sorting specific columns in the Foundation Models instrument  (164113337)\n\n### Localization\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Resolved an issue where the wrong string could be annotated in a screenshot in Localization Catalog Editor.  (162370185) (FB20608107)\n\n### Metal\n\n#### New Features\n\n- GPU Profiling in Metal Debugger is now available for Metal 4. This also requires macOS\/iOS\/visionOS 26.2 beta 2 or newer.  (136244517)\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `SubscriptionStatus.all` returning old `SubscriptionStatus` after a subscription change.  (163505178)\n\n### Testing\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Swift Testing exit tests run correctly when the Swift upcoming “nonisolated(nonsending) By Default” feature (`NonisolatedNonsendingByDefault`) is enabled.  (164424869)\n\n## Updates in Xcode 26.2 Beta\n\n### Address Sanitizer\n\n#### Resolved Issues in Xcode 26.2 Beta\n\n- Fixed: Address Sanitizer is currently incompatible with hardware memory tagging.  (161649378)\n\n### Swift Interoperability with C\/C++\n\n#### New Features in Xcode 26.2 Beta\n\n- You can now annotate C types with the `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` attribute.  (156056071)\n- Retain and release operations for `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types can now return an integer type.  (157853183)\n- Retain and release operations for `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE` types can now be methods of the type. You can now annotate a C\/C++ type with `SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE(.doRetain, .doRelease)` to use methods `doRetain` and `doRelease` as the lifetime operations for the type.
