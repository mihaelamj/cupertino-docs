Xcode 11.3.1 supports on-device debugging for iOS 8 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 11.3.1 requires a Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later.\n\n### General\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- When you create an Objective-C category file by choosing File > New > File, the newly created file includes an import of the AppKit framework. This causes a compilation error for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. (55977950) (FB7346800)\n\n**Workaround:** Remove the import of AppKit from the source file.\n\n### Debugging\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Inspection of global variables in Swift and Objective-C works properly in `lldb`. (57884467)\n\n### Interface Builder\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a crash that could occur when using an attributed string in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UILabel]. (55737956, 57990674)\n- Fixed a crash that could occur after dragging a toolbar item out of the Allowed set in the canvas. (18133890, 57982132)\n\n### Simulator\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue that would cause Xcode to time out waiting for Simulator.app to become ready, when multiple copies of Xcode are installed. (57050823, 57676897)\n- Resolved an issue that prevented Xcode from launching processes with Thread Sanitizer enabled on macOS Catalina 10.15.2. (57822138)\n\n### Source Editor\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a crash that could occur when typing a doc comment after invoking undo. (56522994, 57762965)\n\n### Swift\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Reduced the size of dependency files (`.d`) produced by the Swift compiler, which can improve incremental build times and disk usage for targets with many source files. (57361722, 57865813)\n\n## Xcode 11\n\n- **Xcode 11.7 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.6 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.4.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.4 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes\n- **Xcode 11.2.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
