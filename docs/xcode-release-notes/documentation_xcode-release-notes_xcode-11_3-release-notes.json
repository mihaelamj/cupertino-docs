Xcode 11.3 supports on-device debugging for iOS 8 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 11.3 requires a Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later.\n\n### General\n\n#### New Features\n\n- You can configure the Touch Bar simulator to simulate either 1st generation or 2nd generation Touch Bars. (53885368)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- When you create an Objective-C category file by choosing File > New > File…, the newly created file includes an import of the AppKit framework. This causes a compilation error for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. (55977950) (FB7346800)\n\n**Workaround**: Remove the import of AppKit from the source file.\n\n### Create ML\n\n#### New Features\n\n- A Recommender template is available in Create ML, joining the Image, Sound, Activity, Text and Tabular Classification, Object Detection, Word Tagging and Tabular Regression templates. (56912822)\n\n### Interface Builder\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The color picker panel does not respond to choosing a color while a text field in the inspector has insertion focus. (56067005) (FB7358220)\n\n**Workaround**: Click the Interface Builder canvas to remove focus from the text field, then choose a color in the panel.\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Setting the Selected Segment Tint Color of a segmented control in Interface Builder to a named color doesn’t cause a failure when the view loads on iOS 12 and earlier. (55254963, 55951374)\n- Fixed rendering issues for scenes with large simulated metric free-form sizes. (56920189)\n\n### Previews\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Xcode Previews now use a platform-provided scroll view for the canvas content when running on macOS Catalina 10.15.2 or newer. This change makes it possible to scroll through the canvas using a scroll wheel on a mouse, as well as by dragging horizontal and vertical scrollbars. (53962570)\n\n### Simulator\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Third party “endpoint security” software may cause slow simulators, system freezes, or prevent debug processes from running in simulators reliably. This sometimes manifests as `debugserver` disconnections, or sends simulator applications a `SIGKILL` signal. (55853555)\n\n**Workaround**: Uninstall the third party software.\n- Under certain network conditions, GateKeeper may block simulators from booting, and show error code 60 `\"launchd` failed to respond.” (55878667)\n\n**Workaround**: Try to boot the simulator again. Disabling WiFi or disconnecting from any active VPNs may resolve the problem.\n- When a new Mac Pro has multiple GPUs, Simulator assigns each booted simulator to one of the available GPUs. (56488185)\n\n### Swift Packages\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- You can now submit iOS, tvOS, or watchOS apps with a Swift Package that builds a dynamic library.
