For example:\n\n```swift\nstruct ConditionalCast<T> {\n    func cast(value: Any?) -> T? {\n        return value as? T\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf value is `nil` and the type `T` is an optional type at runtime, the return value will now be `.some(nil)` rather than `nil`. This behavior is consistent with the casting behavior when concrete types are used rather than generic types. (40916953)\n- The C `long double` type is now imported as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Float80] on i386 and x86_64 for macOS and Linux. The `tgmath` functions in the Darwin and glibc modules now support [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Float80] as well as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Float] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Double]. Several tgmath functions have been made generic over [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/BinaryFloatingPoint] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/FloatingPoint] so that they’re automatically available to any conforming type. (SR-2046) (27196587)\n- C macros containing casts are no longer imported to Swift if the type in the cast is unavailable or deprecated, or produces some other diagnostic when referenced. These macros were already only imported under very limited circumstances with very simple values, so this is change unlikely to affect your code. (36528212)\n- To help prevent inconsistent hashing for Cocoa objects, overriding the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class\/hashValue] on [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class] property now produces a compiler warning, and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class\/hash(into:)]) is now marked as nonoverridable. To customize hashing in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class] subclasses, you need to override the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObjectProtocol\/hash] property, not [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class\/hashValue]. The example below shows a sample implementation for an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class] subclass with a custom definition for hashing. Note that hashing and equality go hand in hand: if you override [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObjectProtocol\/hash], you also need to override [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObjectProtocol\/isEqual(_:)], and vice versa (42780635):\n\n```swift\nclass Person: NSObject {\n    let name: String\n\n    init(name: String) {\n        self.name = name\n        super.init()\n    }\n\n    override func isEqual(_ other: Any?) -> Bool {\n        guard let other = other as? Person else { return false }\n        return other.name == self.name\n    }\n\n    override var hash: Int {\n        var hasher = Hasher()\n        hasher.combine(name)\n        return hasher.finalize()\n    }\n}\n```\n- Swift 4.1 warnings about overlapping accesses are now errors in Swift 4 mode. These new errors most commonly arise when a generic mutating method that modifies a variable is passed a non-escaping closure that reads from the same variable. Code that previously compiled with a warning will need to be updated. For more information, see [https:\/\/forums.swift.org\/t\/upgrading-exclusive-access-warning-to-be-an-error-in-swift-4-2\/]. (34669400)\n- The Swift compiler defaults to a new compilation strategy that can greatly speed up debug builds. This strategy allows each compilation job to process a batch of files instead of just a single file.Projects that had sped up debug builds by opting into building with Whole Module Optimization in Debug mode (at `-Onone`) should try the new compilation style. To do so, choose the Incremental option for the Compilation Mode build setting and ensure that your project is not using older whole-module settings for Debug builds such as `SWIFT_WHOLE_MODULE_OPTIMIZATION=YES` or `SWIFT_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL=-Owholemodule`.\n\nThe new compilation strategy should be transparent in terms of the build products. However, in case it causes a problem, you can revert to the previous single file strategy with a custom Build Setting `SWIFT_ENABLE_BATCH_MODE=NO`. (39253613)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n- If you indirectly modify a property using a nonmutating setter that’s defined in a protocol or extension on a class instance, the Swift compiler might miscompile it by releasing the instance after the getter is invoked. This might cause the program to crash or have unpredictable behavior at runtime. (45274900)\n\nFor example:\n\n```swift\nprotocol SomeProtocol { }\nclass SomeClass: SomeProtocol { }\n\nextension SomeProtocol {\n    var someNonmutatingProperty: CGPoint {\n        nonmutating set { _ = self }\n        get { return .zero }\n    }\n}\n\n\/\/ Might be miscompiled, deallocating SomeClass() too early.\nSomeClass().someNonmutatingProperty.x = 42\n```\n\n**Workaround:** Break the operation up into multiple statements so that the get and set operations occur in different statements:\n\n```swift\nlet someObject = SomeClass()\n\/\/ First get the nonmutating property value.\nvar temp = someObject.someNonmutatingProperty\ntemp.x = 42\n\/\/ Then modify it.\nsomeObject.someNonmutatingProperty = temp\n```\n- Passing a let property of a generic class that has function type as an argument to another function or method may cause a compiler crash. (41056468)\n\n**Workaround:** Assign the property to a local variable, and pass the local variable as an argument instead.\n\n```swift\nclass A<B> {\n    let function: (B) -> B\n}\n\nfunc takeFunction(_: (Int) -> Int) {}\n\nfunc passFunction(from a: A<Int>) {\n    \/\/ Reference to a.function as an argument here may crash\n    \/\/ the compiler.\n    takeFunction(a.function)\n\n    \/\/ Workaround: assign to a local variable, and pass the\n    \/\/ local variable instead.\n    let function = a.function\n    takeFunction(function)\n}\n```\n- The compiler may crash or miscompile when forming an array of heterogeneous class objects as an `AnyObject` array (42666956):\n\n```swift\nfunc f(_: [AnyObject])\nf([NSObject.self, NSString.self]) \/\/ May crash or miscompile.\n```\n\n**Workaround:** Individually assign the class objects to variables of type AnyObject, then form an array of those variables:\n\n```swift\nlet myNSObject: AnyObject = NSObject.self\nlet myNSString: AnyObject = NSString.self\n\nf([myNSObject, myNSString])\n```\n- The Swift compiler may crash when trying to assign a super method reference to a variable of optional function type (43360405):\n\n```swift\nclass X: NSObject {\n    var f: ((Any?) -> Bool)?\n    func setF() {\n        f = super.isEqual(to:) \/\/ May crash the compiler.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Workaround:** Assign the closure to a non-optional variable first, then assign the non-optional variable to the optional.\n\n```swift\nclass X: NSObject {\n    var f: ((Any?) -> Bool)?\n\n    func setF() {\n        let f2: (Any?) -> Bool = super.isEqual(to:)\n        \/\/ Work around compiler crash.\n        f = f2\n    }\n}\n```\n- Compilation might fail without displaying the errors responsible for the failure. For example, you might see the message “Command CompileSwiftSources failed with a nonzero exit code” without an accompanying failure reason. (43033749)\n\n**Workaround:** Disable batch mode by adding a user-defined [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev382dac089] named `SWIFT_ENABLE_BATCH_MODE` and set it to `NO`.\n- Invoking a mutating method that returns `Self` on a value of protocol type may cause the compiler to crash (43507711):\n\n```swift\nprotocol Example {\n    mutating func test() -> Self\n}\n\nfunc foo(x: inout Example) {\n    _ = x.test() \/\/ May crash the compiler.\n}\n```\n\n**Workaround:** If possible, make the method non-mutating, or have the method return `Void` or the protocol type instead of `Self`:\n\n```swift\nprotocol Example {\n    mutating func test() -> Example \/\/ Instead of Self.\n}\n\nfunc foo(x: inout Example) {\n    _ = x.test()\n}\n```\n\nIf that isn’t possible, add a wrapper method in a protocol extension that invokes the `Self`-returning method and returns the protocol type:\n\n```swift\nextension Example {\n    mutating func testWorkaround() -> Example {\n        return test()\n    }\n}\n\nfunc foo(x: inout Example) {\n    _ = x.testWorkaround() \/\/ Invoke testWorkaround instead of test to avoid compiler crash.\n}\n```\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- An Objective-C method that takes a block argument annotated with `__attribute__((noescape))` invoked by Swift, no longer raises an incorrect “closure argument passed as `@noescape` to Objective-C has escaped” runtime error. (40857699)\n- The Swift REPL shipped in the Command Line Tools package now successfully imports Objective-C frameworks or Swift frameworks that depend on Objective-C frameworks. (40537961)\n- Generic conversions to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/AnyHashable] at runtime is improved. For example, creating a dictionary using the `init(uniqueKeysWithValues:)` initializer is more stable because the keys you pass are implicitly converted to AnyHashable using the improved conversion behavior. (40583597)\n- When switching over an `@objc` enumeration, if the value is not one of the recognized cases and the switch does not have a default case, the program will trap at run time. (20420436)\n- The Swift REPL now successfully imports frameworks. (40458863)\n- Assigning between properties of a value of protocol type no longer raises in-out exclusivity errors in some circumstances. (39524104)\n- The runtime stability of availability conditions (`if #available`) is improved. (41849700)\n- A conditional conformance no longer implies conformances to any inherited protocols, unlike unconditional ones. This is because the optimal conditional requirements are likely to be different between the two protocols if the inherited protocol can use less restrictive requirements ([https:\/\/bugs.swift.org\/browse\/SR-6569]).\n\nFor example:\n\n```swift\nprotocol Base {}\nprotocol Sub: Base {}\nstruct Generic<Param> {}\n\nextension Generic: Base where Param: Base {}\nextension Generic: Sub where Param: Sub {}\n```\n\nThe first extension has to exist, because the second one does not imply a conformance of `Generic` to `Base` (if it did, it would imply it with the same conditional requirements as the `Sub` conformance, that is, `Param: Sub`). This particularly affects hierarchies like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable]`: `[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Equatable], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/BidirectionalCollection]`: `[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Collection], and helps achieve precision in the bounds of types conforming to them. (36499373)\n- Properties in the header generated by the Swift compiler are now correctly annotated with OS availability information. (37090774)\n- The compiler now correctly handles when a nested type in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Codable] type has the same name as a property of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Codable] type (SR-6569). (37570349)\n- When a property satisfies a requirement in an `@objc` protocol, the selectors for its getter and setter are in all circumstances now inferred from the protocol requirement. (37363245)\n- The compiler now correctly emits code that references the type metadata for a private or internal type that should not be accessible, e.g., because it’s from another module or (in non-WMO mode) source file. The `-emit-public-type-metadata-accessors` compiler flag that was used as a workaround will no longer be available. (39763787)\n- An improved error message is displayed when you pass an optional value where a nonoptional value is required by context. The error message now presents a clear choice between different strategies for fixing the problem, describes what each strategy means, and provides Fix-it dialogs to repair your code. (42081852)\n\nFor example:\n\n```text\nerror: value of optional type 'X?' must be unwrapped to a value\nof type 'X'\nf(x)\n  ^\nnote: coalesce using '??' to provide a default when the optional value\ncontains 'nil'\n  f(x)\n    ^\n     ?? default value\nnote: force-unwrap using '!' to abort execution if the optional value\ncontains 'nil'\n  f(x)\n    ^\n     !\n```\n\nWhen accessing a member of an optional value, the Fix-it dialog includes optional chaining as a potential solution:\n\n```text\nerror: value of optional type 'X?' must be unwrapped to refer to\nmember 'f' of wrapped base type 'X'\n  let _: Int = x.f()\n               ^\nnote: chain the optional using '?' to access member 'f'\nonly for non-'nil' base values\n  let _: Int = x.f()\n               ^\n                ?\nnote: force-unwrap using '!' to abort execution if the optional\nvalue contains 'nil'\n  let _: Int = x.f()\n               ^\n                !\n```\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/os\/os_signpost(_:dso:log:name:signpostID:)-2oz8u] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/os\/os_log(_:dso:log:type:_:)] functions have been updated to not have a labeled `type` parameter. (40528229)\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIEdgeInsets\/zero] property on [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIEdgeInsets] can now be used. (40735990)\n- When a Swift method is exposed to Objective-C with a custom selector beginning with “new”, “copy”, or “mutableCopy”, it will correctly return an owned (+1) value rather than an autoreleased (+0) one when called from Objective-C, as expected by Objective-C ARC. (SR-6065](https:\/\/bugs.swift.org\/browse\/SR-6065) (34834291)\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle] initializer [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle\/init(for:)] now returns the correct bundle when used on a class that inherits from a generic class. (40367300)\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/type(of:)] function now provides the expected result when object is being observed using key-value observing. (37319860)\n\n### Swift Language\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Custom compile-time warnings or error messages can be emitted using the `#warning(_:)` and `#error(_:)` directives ([https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0196-diagnostic-directives.md]). (16015824)\n\n```swift\n#warning(\"This code is incomplete.\")\n\n#if BUILD_CONFIG && OTHER_BUILD_CONFIG\n      #error(\"BUILD_CONFIG and OTHER_BUILD_CONFIG can't both be set\")\n#endif\n```\n- Public classes may now have internal required initializers. The rule for required initializers is that they must be available everywhere the class can be subclassed, but previously required initializers on public classes were forced to be public themselves. This limitation was a holdover from before the introduction of the `open`-`public` distinction in Swift 3. (22845087)\n- As part of fully implementing [https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0054-abolish-iuo.md], `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional<T>` is now an unavailable typealias of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Optional]`<T>`. Declarations annotated with ‘`!`’ have the type [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Optional]`<T>`. If an expression involving one of these values will not compile successfully with the type [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Optional]`<T>`, it is implicitly unwrapped, producing a value of type `T`. In some cases this will cause code that previously compiled to require updating. For more information, see [https:\/\/swift.org\/blog\/iuo\/]. (33272674)\n- The new [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CaseIterable] protocol describes types which have a static [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CaseIterable\/allCases-swift.type.property] property that’s used to describe all of the cases of the type. Swift synthesizes the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CaseIterable\/allCases-swift.type.property] property for enumerations that have no associated values. (SE-0194) (17102392).\n\nFor example:\n\n```swift\nenum Suit: CaseIterable {\n    case spade\n    case heart\n    case diamond\n    case club\n}\n\nprint(Suit.allCases)\n\/\/ prints [Suit.heart, Suit.club, Suit.diamond, Suit.spade]\n```\n- Various function-like declarations can now be marked as `@inlinable`, making their bodies available for optimizations from other modules. Inlinable function bodies must only reference public declarations, unless the referenced declaration is marked as `@usableFromInline` ([https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0193-cross-module-inlining-and-specialization.md]). (40566899)\n\nNote that the presence of the attribute itself does not force inlining or any other optimization to be performed, nor does it have any effect on optimizations performed within a single module.\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Protocol conformances are now able to be synthesized in extensions in the same file as the type definition, allowing automatic synthesis of conditional conformances to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Equatable] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Codable]. For instance, if there is a generic wrapper type that can only be [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Equatable] when its wrapped type is also [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Equatable], the `==` method can be automatically constructed by the compiler:\n\n```swift\nstruct Generic<Param> {\n    var property: Param\n}\n\nextension Generic: Equatable where Param: Equatable {}\n\/\/ Automatically synthesized inside the extension:\n\/\/ static func ==(lhs: Generic, rhs: Generic) -> Bool {\n\/\/     return lhs.property == rhs.property\n\/\/ }\n```\n\nCode that wants to be as precise as possible should generally not conditionally conform to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Codable] directly, but rather its two constituent protocols [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Encodable] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Decodable], or else one can only (for instance) decode a `Generic<Param>` if `Param` is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Encodable] in addition to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Decodable], even though [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Encodable] is likely not required:\n\n```swift\n\/\/ Unnecessarily restrictive:\nextension Generic: Codable where Param: Codable {}\n\n\/\/ More precise:\nextension Generic: Encodable where Param: Encodable {}\nextension Generic: Decodable where Param: Decodable {}\n```\n\nFinally, due to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Decodable] having an initializer requirement, it’s not possible to conform to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Decodable] in an extension to a class that isn’t `final`. Such a class needs to have any initializers from protocols be `required`, which means they need to be in the class definition. ([https:\/\/bugs.swift.org\/browse\/SR-6803]) (39199726)\n- Runtime query of conditional conformances is now implemented. Therefore, a dynamic cast such as `value as? P`, where the dynamic type of value conditionally conforms to `P`, will succeed when the conditional requirements are met. ([https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0143-conditional-conformances.md]) (40349058)\n\n```swift\nprotocol P {}\n\nstruct DoesntConform {}\nstruct Conforms: P {}\n\nstruct Generic<Param> {}\nextension Generic: P where Param: P {}\n\nprint(Generic<DoesntConform>() as? P) \/\/ nil\nprint(Generic<Conforms>() as? P)\n\/\/ Optional(main.Generic<main.Conforms>())\n```\n\n### Swift Migrator\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- The Swift 4.2 migrator correctly updates member variable references to global variable references. (41658300)\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\n#### New Features\n\n- The `generate-xcodeproj` command has a new `--watch` option to watch the file system and automatically regenerate the Xcode project if needed. (32390792)\n- The `swiftLanguageVersions` property in the PackageDescription manifest API for tools version 4.2 is changed from an array of integers to an array of `SwiftVersion` enumeration cases. ([https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0209-package-manager-swift-lang-version-update.md]) (38721967) For example:\n\n```swift\n\/\/ swift-tools-version:4.2\nimport PackageDescription\n\nlet package = Package(\n    \/\/ ...\n    swiftLanguageVersions: [.v3, .v4]\n)\n```\n- The package manager now supports declaring a dependency on a package using its path on disk instead of the Git URL. This requires updating the package’s tools version to 4.2. (39418745)\n- The scheme generation logic is improved and generates schemes as follows: One scheme contains all regular and test targets of the root package; One scheme per executable target containing the test targets whose dependencies intersect with the dependencies of the exectuable target. (30955712).\n- The PackageDescription API in tools version 4.2 supports a new type of target called a “system library target”, which moves the current system-module packages feature from package to target level. (39418939)\n- Swift targets are now compiled using batch mode. (39262812)\n- The package manager emits deprecation notices for manifests that use the version 3 API in a package dependency graph. (41792011)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The package manager might crash if a package graph contains shared dependencies with versioned and revision based requirements. Consider the following example package graph:\n\n```text\nRoot package:\n    PackageA@branch\nPackageA:\n    PackageB@branch\n    PackageC@branch\nPackageB:\n    PackageC@1.0.0..<2.0.0\n```\n\nAccording to the package manager’s dependency resolution rules, this should resolve to: PackageA @ branch, PackageB @ branch and PackageC @ branch. However, since the shared dependency PackageC is referenced with a `1.0.0..<2.0.0` requirement, it may result in a crash. (43107896)\n\n**Workaround:** Use either versioned or revisioned based requirement for the shared package dependencies.\n\n### Swift Standard Library\n\n#### New Features\n\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Range] is now conditionally a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/RandomAccessCollection] when its `Bound` is `Strideable` with a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/SignedInteger] stride. This means that you can now use use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Range] as a collection when these criteria are met. (40564272)\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CountableRange] is now a constrained generic type alias for a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Range], rather than an independent type. This means that you can still use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CountableRange] in the same ways as before: extend it, take it as an argument to a function, or declare a variable of that type. But you can also now use ranges and countable ranges interchangeably:\n\n```swift\nlet countableRange: CountableRange<Int> = 0..<10\nvar range: Range = countableRange\n\nfunc f<T: SignedInteger>(_ countableRange: CountableRange<T>) { }\nf(range)\n```\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/ClosedRange] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CountableClosedRange] have the same behavior as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Range] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CountableRange], respectively.\n- The standard library types [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Optional], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Array], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/ArraySlice], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/ContiguousArray], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Dictionary], `DictionaryLiteral`, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Range], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/ClosedRange] now conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable] protocol when their element or bound types (as the case may be) conform to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/AnyHashable]. This makes synthesized [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable] implementations available for types that include stored properties of these types. ([https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0143-conditional-conformances.md], 40567748)\n- The standard library now uses a high-quality, randomly seeded, universal hash function, represented by the new [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hasher] struct. Random seeding varies the result of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable\/hashValue] on each execution of a program, improving the reliability of the standard library’s hashed collections, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Set] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Dictionary]. In particular, random seeding enables better protection against (accidental or deliberate) hash-flooding attacks.\n\nAs a consequence of random seeding, the elements in sets and dictionaries may have a different order on each execution. This may expose some bugs in your existing code that accidentally relies on repeatable ordering.\n\nAdditionally, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable] protocol now includes an extra function requirement, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable\/hash(into:)]. The new requirement is designed to be much easier to implement than the old hashValue property, and it generally provides better hashing. To implement [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable\/hash(into:)], feed the exact same components of your type that you compare in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Equatable] protocol’s `==` implementation to the supplied [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hasher]:\n\n```swift\nstruct Foo: Hashable {\n    var a: String?\n    var b: [Int]\n    var c: [String: Int]\n\n    static func ==(lhs: Foo, rhs: Foo) -> Bool {\n        return lhs.a == rhs.a && lhs.b == rhs.b && lhs.c == rhs.c\n    }\n\n    func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {\n        hasher.combine(a)\n        hasher.combine(b)\n        hasher.combine(c)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAutomatic synthesis for Hashable ([https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0185-synthesize-equatable-hashable.md]) has been updated to generate hash(into:) implementations. For example, the `==` and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable\/hash(into:)] implementations above are equivalent to the ones synthesized by the compiler, and can be removed without changing the meaning of the code.\n\nSynthesis has also been extended to support deriving [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable\/hashValue] from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable\/hash(into:)], and vice versa. Therefore, code that only implements [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable\/hashValue] continues to work in Swift 4.2. This new compiler functionality works for all types that can implement [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Hashable], including classes.\n\nNote that these changes don’t affect Foundation’s hashing interface. Classes that subclass [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class] should override the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObjectProtocol\/hash] property, like before.\n\nIn certain controlled environments, such as while running particular tests, it may be helpful to selectively disable hash seed randomization, so that hash values and the order of elements in set and dictionary values remain consistent across executions. You can disable hash seed randomization by defining the environment variable `SWIFT_DETERMINISTIC_HASHING` with the value of 1. The Swift runtime looks at this variable during process startup and, if it’s defined, replaces the random seed with a constant value. ([https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0206-hashable-enhancements.md]) (35052153)\n- The standard library now has a random generator API. The Swift standard library now supports generating and using random numbers. Swift collections now support [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/MutableCollection\/shuffle()] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Sequence\/shuffled()] operations as well as choosing a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Collection\/randomElement()]. Numeric types can now generate a uniform value in a range, for example: `Int.random(in: 1...10)` or `Double.random(in: 0..<100)`, and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Bool] provides a random `true` or `false` method: [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Bool\/random()].\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/RandomNumberGenerator] protocol has been introduced as a source of randomness to drive these methods, with a default implementation for each platform. This implementation wraps `arc4random_buf(_:_:)`. (40564129)\n- `Random.default` is renamed [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/SystemRandomNumberGenerator] to avoid misuse and to conform to naming guidelines. For more information, see the amendment in [https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0202-random-unification.md]. (42298827)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- The behavior of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CustomStringConvertible\/description] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/CustomDebugStringConvertible\/debugDescription] properties for floating-point numbers use a new algorithm that is both more accurate and significantly faster than the previous code. In particular, it’s now guaranteed that `Double(String(d)) == d` for every [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Double] value `d`. Previously these unconditionally printed a fixed number of decimal digits (15 and 17 for [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/Double], respectively). They now print exactly as many digits as are needed for the resulting string to convert back to the original source value, and no more ([https:\/\/bugs.swift.org\/browse\/SR-106]).
