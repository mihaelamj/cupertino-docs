Xcode 11.1 supports on-device debugging for iOS 8 and later, tvOS 9 and later, and watchOS 2 and later. Xcode 11.1 requires a Mac running macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later.\n\n### General\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Xcode may fail to update from the Mac App Store after updating to macOS Catalina. (56061273)\n\n**Workaround**: To trigger a new download you can delete the existing Xcode.app or temporarily change the file extension so it is no longer visible to the App Store.\n\n### Asset Catalogs\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Images in the asset catalog won’t be found at runtime when running on watchOS 4. (55395258)\n\n### Interface Builder\n\n#### New Features\n\n- You can now preview your interface for the 7th generation iPad. (53957165)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- There is an issue with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITabBarController] where decoding an instance from a storyboard will create some extra views at the left end of the screen. Developers may remove these by applying a workaround. (55310448)\n\n**Workaround**: To remove the extraneous views from Storyboard, create a subclass of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITabBarController] and add the following snippet in the class’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/init(coder:)] method:\n\n```swift\nclass WorkaroundTabBarController: UITabBarController {\n    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\n        super.init(coder: coder)\n\n        \/\/ This must be run immediately after the call to super.\n        if tabBar.subviews.count > 1 {\n            tabBar.subviews[0].isHidden = true\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when compiling XIB files in iOS projects that backwards deploy to iOS versions earlier than 13.0. (55271752)\n\n### Localization\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITableViewCell] labels in storyboards and XIB files do not use localized string values from the strings file at runtime. (52839404)\n\n### Simulator\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- On macOS Catalina, iCloud Drive will crash in a loop on simulated devices running older versions of iOS. (51392951, 54282967, 54818084)\n\n**Workaround**: Log out of iCloud in impacted simulators to halt the crash cycle.\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- CarPlay works on iOS 13.1 simulators. (54492162)\n\n### Swift\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The `NEHotspotConfigurationError` enum from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension] framework changed from `NS_ENUM` to `NS_ERROR_ENUM`, which can cause compiler errors in existing Swift code that uses the enum. For example, in code like this:\n\n```swift\nlet code = NEHotspotConfigurationError(rawValue: errorCode)\n```\n\nYou will see the error message: “error: incorrect argument label in call (have ‘rawValue:’, expected ‘_nsError:’).” (54134493)\n\n**Workaround**: Replace references of `NEHotspotConfigurationError` with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEHotspotConfigurationError]. For the above example, change the code to:\n\n```swift\nlet code = NEHotspotConfigurationError.Code(rawValue: errorCode)\n```\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue with Xcode Previews where debugging a preview would no longer pin the preview, and navigating would lose the debug session. (54758098)\n\n### Swift Packages\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- If an iOS, tvOS, or watchOS app uses a Swift Package that builds a dynamic library, it cannot be submitted to the App Store. (55564324)\n\n**Workaround**: Modify the Package manifest to build a static library.\n\n### watchOS\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- watchOS applications built with the watchOS 6 SDK and a deployment target of watchOS 5.3 will crash on launch when run on watchOS 5.3. (55360395)\n\n**Workaround**: Set the `__WKEXTENSIONMAIN_LEGACY_TARGET_5_3` build setting to “legacy,” or use another deployment target instead of 5.3.\n\n## Xcode 11\n\n- **Xcode 11.7 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.6 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.4.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.4 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.3.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes\n- **Xcode 11.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes\n- **Xcode 11.2.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11.2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **Xcode 11 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
