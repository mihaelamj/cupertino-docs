The Xcode 13.3.1 release supports on-device debugging for iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, tvOS 15.4, watchOS 8.5 and later. Xcode 13.3.1 requires a Mac running macOS Monterey 12 or later.\n\n### Apple Clang Compiler\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Exporting an app that uses Swift’s concurrency features from an archive with bitcode might fail when the app targets iOS 13.0–14.7, watchOS 6.0–7.6, or tvOS 13.0–14.7. (89271047)\n- When you target iOS 13.4 and later and enable bitcode, the bitcode segment is now stripped correctly. This fixes a crash that prevented some apps from running in older operating systems (iOS 14 and earlier).
