The starting and ending points should be specified in page space, relative to their respective pages.\n\nThe starting and ending points can be on the same page. In this case, invoking this method is equivalent to sending the `selectionFromPoint:toPoint:` message to a `PDFPage` object.\n\nPage space is a 72 dpi coordinate system with the origin at the lower-left corner of the current page.",
