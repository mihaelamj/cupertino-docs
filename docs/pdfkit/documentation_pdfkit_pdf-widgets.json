  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe PDF file format allows for annotations to be associated with a page and a location on that page. One powerful annotation type is the widget, which represents interactive form elements. PDFKit supports three widget types: text, button, and choice widgets. Text widgets are basic text fields. Button widgets consist of three subtypes: radio buttons, checkboxes, and push buttons. Choice widgets consist of two subtypes: list (a table view) and combo box (a drop-down). This sample includes text and button widgets.\n\n### Create Widget Annotations\n\nAll widget annotations are instantiated using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PDFKit\/PDFAnnotation] constructor with subtype [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PDFKit\/PDFAnnotationSubtype\/widget].

The `maximumLength` property sets the maximum number of characters a user can enter into the text field. The `hasComb` property, if set, divides the text field into as many equally spaced positions, or combs, as the value of the maximum length of the field. The `hasComb` property only works in conjunction with the `maximumLength` property.\n\nThe `textFieldMultiline` text widget annotation sets one extra property: `isMultiline`. By default, all text widget annotations are single line, meaning they don’t include word wrapping. If you want to create a large, multiline text widget with word wrapping, set this property to `true`.\n\n**Radio widget properties.** The `radioButtonYes` and `radioButtonNo` button widget annotations set two extra properties: `fieldName` and `buttonWidgetStateString`. All widgets have their own unique identifier, which is determined by the `fieldName` property. To group widgets—in this case the radio buttons—the buttons must have the same field name, which is set in `ViewController`. To give radio buttons of the same field name their own unique subidentifier, the `buttonWidgetStateString` property must be set on each, which is also done in `ViewController`. When the radio buttons are grouped by field name, and each has its own unique `buttonWidgetStateString`, they behave like normal radio buttons (where selecting one deselects others in the group).\n\n**Button widget properties.** The `resetButton` button widget annotation sets one extra property: [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PDFKit\/PDFActionResetForm]. With this property set, the given action is performed when the user clicks (or taps) this button. The `PDFActionResetForm` action is special in that it clears all widgets associated with it. `PDFActionResetForm` takes an array of strings that represent widget field names. The default behavior is to clear all fields included in that array. This behavior can be changed to clear all widgets not included in the array, by setting the `fieldsIncludedAreCleared` property to false. Because the behavior to clear all widgets isn’t included in the list, and no field names were set, this action clears all widgets in the document.",
