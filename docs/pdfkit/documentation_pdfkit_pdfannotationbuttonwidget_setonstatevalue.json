Although “On” is an acceptable string for the on state of a single checkbox, a group of two or more radio buttons should have a unique string associated with each control.\n\nFor example, a form might display a group of 3 radio buttons that allow users to indicate an account type, such as savings, checking, or investment. The strings associated with the on states of these buttons could be “Savings,” “Checking,” and “Investment.” In this example, these 3 radio buttons also would share a field name string, such as “AccountType.”",
