Otherwise, if `destination` matches the receiver’s position, `compare` returns `NSOrderedSame`.\n\nThis method ignores the horizontal component of the destination point (the x value). If the destination’s vertical component (or y value) is [doc:\/\/com.apple.pdfkit\/documentation\/PDFKit\/PDFDestination], `compare` treats the destination as if its y value is the top point on the destination page.\n\nAn exception is raised if `destination` does not have a page associated with it or if its page is associated with a document other than the receiver’s document.",
