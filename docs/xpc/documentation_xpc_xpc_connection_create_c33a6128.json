The returned connection will be a peer.\n\nIf `NULL`, an anonymous listener connection will be created. You can embed the ability to create new peer connections in an endpoint, which can be inserted into a message and sent to another process .\n- **targetq**: The GCD queue to which the event handler block will be submitted. This parameter may be `NULL`, in which case the connection’s target queue will be the default target queue of `libdispatch`, defined as `DISPATCH_TARGET_QUEUE_DEFAULT`. The target queue may be changed later with a call to [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/xpc_connection_set_target_queue(_:_:)].\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new connection object. The caller is responsible for disposing of the returned object with [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/xpc_release] when it is no longer needed.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method will succeed even if the named service does not exist. This is because the XPC namespace is not queried for the service name until the first call to [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/xpc_connection_resume(_:)].\n\nXPC connections, like dispatch sources, are returned in a suspended state, so you must call [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/xpc_connection_resume(_:)] in order to begin receiving events from the connection. Also like dispatch sources, connections must be resumed in order to be safely released. It is a programming error to release a suspended connection.\n\n## Creation\n\n- **xpc_connection_t**: A type that represents a connection to a named service.\n- **xpc_connection_create_from_endpoint(_:)**: Creates a new connection from the specified endpoint.\n- **xpc_connection_create_mach_service(_:_:_:)**: Creates a new connection object that represents a Mach service.\n- **xpc_connection_set_target_queue(_:_:)**: Sets the target queue of the connection.\n- **XPC_CONNECTION_MACH_SERVICE_LISTENER**: A flag that indicates the caller is the listener for the named service.\n- **XPC_CONNECTION_MACH_SERVICE_PRIVILEGED**: A flag that indicates the job advertising the service name belongs to a launch daemon rather than a launch agent.\n\n",
