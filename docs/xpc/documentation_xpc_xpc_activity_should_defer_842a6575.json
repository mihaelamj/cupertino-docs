If not, the system indicates that the application should defer the activity. The application may acknowledge the deferral by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/xpc_activity_set_state(_:_:)] with [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/XPC_ACTIVITY_STATE_DEFER]. Once deferred, the system places the activity back into the WAIT state and invokes the handler block again at the earliest opportunity when the criteria are once again satisfied.",
