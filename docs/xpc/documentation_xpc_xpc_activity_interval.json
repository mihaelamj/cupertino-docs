Due to the nature of XPC Activity finding an opportune time to run the activity, any two occurrences may be more or less than [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL] seconds apart, but on average are [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL] seconds apart. The presence of this key implies the following, unless you override these values:\n\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/XPC_ACTIVITY_REPEATING] with a value of `true`\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/XPC_ACTIVITY_DELAY] with a value of half the interval. The delay enforces a minimum distance between any two occurrences.\n- [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/XPC_ACTIVITY_GRACE_PERIOD] with a value of half the interval. The grace period is the amount of time that passes after the end of the interval before more aggressive scheduling occurs. The grace period doesn’t increase the size of the interval.\n\n## Time Intervals\n\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_1_MIN**: A constant that represents a 1-minute time interval.\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_5_MIN**: A constant that represents a 5-minute time interval.\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_15_MIN**: A constant that represents a 15-minute time interval.\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_30_MIN**: A constant that represents a 30-minute time interval.\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_1_HOUR**: A constant that represents a 1-hour time interval.\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_4_HOURS**: A constant that represents a 4-hour time interval.\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_8_HOURS**: A constant that represents an 8-hour time interval.\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_1_DAY**: A constant that represents a one-day time interval.\n- **XPC_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_7_DAYS**: A constant that represents a seven-day time interval.\n\n",
