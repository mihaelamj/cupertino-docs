The runtime will still attempt to deliver outgoing messages, but this error should be treated as an indication that the program will exit very soon, and any outstanding business over the connection should be wrapped up as quickly as possible and the connection canceled shortly thereafter.\n\nThis error will only be delivered to peer connections received through a listener or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.xpc\/documentation\/XPC\/xpc_main(_:)] event handler.",
