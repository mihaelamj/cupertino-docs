If this is an IP address, inet_arp_init_ifaddr should be called. This is usually performed in the protocol attachment's ioctl handler.\n\nWhen the event handler for the protocol attachment receives a KEV_DL_LINK_ADDRESS_CHANGED event, the event handler should call inet_arp_init_ifaddr for each interface ip address.\n\nFor an example, see bsd\/net\/ether_inet_pr_module.c in xnu.
