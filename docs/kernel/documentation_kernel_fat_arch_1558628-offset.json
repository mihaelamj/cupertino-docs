Specifies the specific member of the CPU family on which this entry may be used or a constant specifying all members.\n- **size**: Size of the data for this CPU.\n- **align**: The power of 2 alignment for the offset of the object file for the architecture specified in `cputype` within the binary. This is required to ensure that, if this binary is changed, the contents it retains are correctly aligned for virtual memory paging and other uses.\n\n",
