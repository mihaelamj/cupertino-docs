These parameters provide details about your system that can aid in tuning performance. For example, you can obtain the count of the highest-performing processor cores to spawn a worker thread for each core. Or you can determine the size of the L2 cache and the number of processor cores that share it to perform software cache-blocking optimization.\n\n### Determine processor characteristics\n\nThe system enables a processor core when it’s powered on and available for thread scheduling. Each logical processor core executes a software thread that the operating system manages. On systems where the number of logical processor cores exceeds the number of physical processor cores, two or more logical processor cores share a physical core through simultaneous multithreading (SMT). The following parameters provide processor availability information about the system on chip (SoC):\n\n\n\n### Determine system topology\n\nThe following parameters provide processor core performance-level information. First, determine the number of types of processor cores with `hw.nperflevels`. Then, for each of the parameters, replace *N* with a number between `0` and the number of performance levels minus one. Lower values of *N* indicate higher-performance core types.\n\nQuerying the following parameters is equivalent to querying the per-performance-level information for the least performant core.
