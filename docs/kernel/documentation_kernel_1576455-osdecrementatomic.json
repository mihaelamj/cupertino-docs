It is specifically unsuitable for use on noncacheable memory such as that in devices; this function cannot guarantee atomicity, for example, on memory mapped from a PCI device. Previous incarnations of this function incorporated a memory barrier on systems with weakly-ordered memory architectures, but current versions contain no barriers.",
