It returns true if the bit was already clear, false otherwise.\n\nThis function guarantees atomicity only with main system memory. It is specifically unsuitable for use on noncacheable memory such as that in devices; this function cannot guarantee atomicity, for example, on memory mapped from a PCI device. Additionally, this function incorporates a memory barrier on systems with weakly-ordered memory architectures.",
