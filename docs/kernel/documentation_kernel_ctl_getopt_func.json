A buffer is allocated for storage and passed to your function. The length of that buffer is also passed. Upon return, you should set *len to length of the buffer used. In some cases, data may be NULL. When this happens, *len should be set to the length you would have returned had data not been NULL. If the buffer is too small, return an error.",
