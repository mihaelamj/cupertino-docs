  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nOSObject defines the minimal functionality required of Libkern and I\/O Kit C++ classes: tie-in to the run-time type information facility, the dynamic allocation\/initialization paradigm, and reference counting. While kernel extensions are free to use their own C++ classes internally, any interaction they have with Libkern or the I\/O Kit will require classes ultimately derived from OSObject.\n\n**Run-Time Type Information**\n\nOSObject is derived from the abstract root class OSMetaClassBase, which declares (and defines many of) the primitives on which the run-time type information facility is based. A parallel inheritance hierarchy of metaclass objects provides run-time introspection, including access to class names, inheritance, and safe type-casting. See OSMetaClass for more information.\n\n**Dynamic Allocation\/Initialization**\n\nThe kernel-resident C++ runtime does not support exceptions, so Libkern classes cannot use standard C++ object constructors and destructors, which use exceptions to report errors. To support error-handling during instance creation, then, OSObject separates object allocation from initialization. You can create a new OSObject-derived instance with the `new` operator, but this does nothing more than allocate memory and initialize the reference count to 1. Following this, you must call a designated initialization function and check its `bool` return value. If the initialization fails, you must immediately call release on the instance and handle the failure in whatever way is appropriate. Many Libkern and I\/O Kit classes define static instance-creation functions (beginning with the word \"with\") to make construction a one-step process for clients.\n\n**Reference Counting**\n\nOSObject provides reference counting services using the retain, release(), release(int freeWhen) and free functions. The public interface to the reference counting is retain, and release; release(int freeWhen) is provided for objects that have internal retain cycles.\n\nIn general, a subclass is expected to only override free. It may also choose to override release(int freeWhen) if the object has a circular retain count, as noted above.\n\n**Use Restrictions**\n\nWith very few exceptions in the I\/O Kit, all Libkern-based C++ classes, functions, and macros are **unsafe** to use in a primary interrupt context. Consult the I\/O Kit documentation related to primary interrupts for more information.\n\n**Concurrency Protection**\n\nThe basic features of OSObject are thread-safe. Most Libkern subclasses are not, and require locking or other protection if instances are shared between threads. I\/O Kit driver objects are either designed for use within thread-safe contexts or designed to inherently be thread-safe. Always check the individual class documentation to see what steps are necessary for concurrent use of instances.",
