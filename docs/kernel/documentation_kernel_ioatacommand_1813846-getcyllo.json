Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nvirtual UInt8 getCylLo (\n void ); \n```\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **getActualTransfer**: The byte count on the ending result, as best as can be determined by the controller. May be zero, but partial transfer may have occurred on error in some cases.\n- **getBuffer**: the IOMemoryDescriptor used in this transaction.\n- **getCommandInUse**: returns true if IOATAController is still in control of the command.\n- **getCylHi**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **getDevice_Head**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **getEndErrorReg**: If the error bit was set in the status register, the value of the error register is returned at the end of a command.\n- **getEndStatusReg**: the value of the status register on the end of the command.\n- **getErrorReg**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **getResult**: IOReturn value of the result of this command. ATA family errors are defined in IOATATypes.h\n- **getSectorCount**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **getSectorNumber**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **getStatus**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **setBuffer**: set the IIOMemoryDescriptor for this transaction.\n- **setByteCount**: set the byte count for this transaction. Should agree with the device command and the memory descriptor in use.\n- **setCallbackPtr**: set the function pointer to call when this command completes.\n- **setCommand**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **setCylHi**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **setCylLo**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **setDevice_Head**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **setFeatures**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **setFlags**: set the flags for this command, as defined in IOATATypes.\n- **setLBA28**: convenience method that sets the taskfile registers into a 28-bit LBA address, with unit selected and LBA bit set. return err if param out of range, return kIOSuccess (kATANoErr) = 0 on return if successful\n- **setOpcode**: command opcode as defined in IOATATypes.\n- **setPacketCommand**: ATAPI command packet max size is 16 bytes. Makes deep copy of data.\n- **setPosition**: used to set an offset into the memory descriptor for this transfer.\n- **setRegMask**: used when accessing registers or reading registers on an error result. Mask is defined in IOATATypes.h\n- **setSectorCount**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **setSectorNumber**: Taskfile access. Registers are named in accordance with ATA Standards conventions\n- **setTimeoutMS**: how long to allow this command to complete, in milliseconds, once issued to the hardware. if the time period expires, this command will return with a timeout error.\n- **setTransferChunkSize**: set the size of transfer between intervening interrupts. necessary when doing PIO Read\/Write Multiple, etc. so the controller knows when to expect an interrupt during multi-sector data transfers.\n- **setUnit**: set the unit number for this command.\n- **zeroCommand**: set to blank state, MUST call prior to re-use of this object\n\n",
