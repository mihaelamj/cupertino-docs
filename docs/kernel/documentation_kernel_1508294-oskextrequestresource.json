May be `NULL`.\n- **requestTagOut**: If non-`NULL`, filled on success with a tag identifying the pending request (or on failure with `kOSKextRequestTagInvalid`; can be used with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/kernel\/1508350-oskextcancelrequest].\n\n## Return Value\n\n`kOSReturnSuccess` if the request is successfully queued. `kOSKextReturnInvalidArgument` if `kextIdentifier` or `resourceName` or if `callback` is not an address within a loaded kext executable. `kOSKextReturnStopping` if an unload attempt is being made on the kext containing `callback`.

In this case the kext gets the `context` pointer and can clean it up.\n- The request is made during a kext's module start routine and the start routine returns an error. In this case, callbacks cannot be safely invoked, so the kext should clean up all request contexts when returning the error from the start routine.\n\nKexts with pending requests are not subject to autounload, but requests are subject to timeout after a few minutes.
