Warning: the value returned by this function is not 100% reliable. There is a race condition where it is possible that the new thread has already terminated before this call returns. Under that circumstance the IOThread returned will be invalid. In general there is little that can be done with this value except compare it against 0. The thread itself can call IOThreadSelf() 100% reliably and that is the prefered mechanism to manipulate the IOThreads state.",
