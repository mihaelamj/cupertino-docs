Its parameters can determine which vnodes to skip in the process and whether in-use vnodes should be forcibly reclaimed. File systems should call this function from their unmount code, because VFS code will always call it with SKIPROOT | SKIPSWAP | SKIPSYSTEM; file systems must take care of such vnodes themselves.",
