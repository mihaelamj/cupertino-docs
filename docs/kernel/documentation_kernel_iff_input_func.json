If you specified a protocol when attaching your filter, the protocol will only ever be the protocol you specified.\n- **data**: The inbound packet, after the frame header as determined by the interface.\n- **frame_ptr**: A pointer to the pointer to the frame header. The frame header length can be found by inspecting the interface's frame header length (ifnet_hdrlen).\n\n## Return Value\n\nReturn: 0 - The caller will continue with normal processing of the packet. EJUSTRETURN - The caller will stop processing the packet, the packet will not be freed. Anything Else - The caller will free the packet and stop processing.\n\n## Discussion\n\niff_input_func is used to filter incoming packets.
