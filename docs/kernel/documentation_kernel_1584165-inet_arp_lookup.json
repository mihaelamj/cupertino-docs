If this function returns EJUSTRETURN, the packet has been queued and will be sent when an arp response is received. If any other value is returned, the caller is responsible for disposing of the packet.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis function will check the routing table for a cached arp entry or trigger an arp query to resolve the ip address to a link-layer address.\n\nArp entries are stored in the routing table. This function will lookup the ip destination in the routing table. If the destination requires forwarding to a gateway, the route of the gateway will be looked up. The route entry is inspected to determine if the link layer destination address is known. If unknown, the arp generation function for IP attached to the interface is called to create an arp request packet.",
