VFS_KERNEL_EVENT: need for update is driven by in-kernel events. Skip extra authentication.\n\n## Return Value\n\n0 for success, or an error code for authentication failure or problem with call to filesystem to request information.\n\n## Discussion\n\nEach filesystem has a struct vfsstatfs associated with it which is updated as events occur; this function updates it so that the structure pointer returned by vfs_statfs() returns a pointer to fairly recent data.\n\n",
