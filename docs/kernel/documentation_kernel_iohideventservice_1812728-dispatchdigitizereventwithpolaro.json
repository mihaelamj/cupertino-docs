This is typically used to determine the distance between the transducer and surface\n- **tipPressure**: Absolute pressure exerted on surface by tip from 0.0 to 1.0 in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **auxPressure**: Absolute pressure exerted on transducer from 0.0 to 1.0 in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **twist**: Absolute clockwise rotation along the transducer's major axis from 0.0 to 360.0 degrees in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **altitude**: Specifies angle with the X-Y plane thorugh a signed, semicircular range. Positive values specify an angle downward and toward the positive Z axis. Value is represented in degrees from -180.0 to 180.0 in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **azimuth**: Counter clockwise rotation of the cursor around the Z-axis through a full circular range. Value is represented in degrees from 0.0 to 360.0 in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **options**: Additional options to be used when dispatching event.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is meant to be used with transducers that leverage polar orientation\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **dispatchDigitizerEvent**: Dispatch tablet events without orientation\n- **dispatchDigitizerEventWithTiltOrientation**: Dispatch tablet events with tilt orientation\n- **dispatchMultiAxisPointerEvent**: Dispatch multi-axis pointer event\n- **handleClose**: Handle a client close on the interface.\n- **handleIsOpen**: Query whether a client has an open on the interface.\n- **handleOpen**: Handle a client open on the interface.\n- **handleStart**: Prepare the hardware and driver to support I\/O operations.\n- **handleStop**: Quiesce the hardware and stop the driver.\n\n",
