Allocates wired memory in the kernel map, with an alignment restriction and physically contiguous.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nvoid * IOMallocContiguous(vm_size_t size, vm_size_t alignment, IOPhysicalAddress *physicalAddress);\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **size**: Size of the memory requested.\n- **alignment**: Byte count of the alignment for the memory. For example, pass 256 to get memory allocated at an address with bits 0-7 zero.\n- **physicalAddress**: IOMallocContiguous returns the physical address of the allocated memory here, if physicalAddress is a non-zero pointer. The physicalAddress argument is deprecated and should be passed as NULL. To obtain the physical address for a memory buffer, use the IODMACommand class in conjunction with the IOMemoryDescriptor or IOBufferMemoryDescriptor classes.\n\n## Return Value\n\nVirtual address of the allocated memory, or zero on failure.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis is a utility to allocate memory in the kernel, with an alignment restriction which is specified as a byte count, and will allocate only physically contiguous memory. The request may fail if memory is fragmented, and may cause large amounts of paging activity.
