The sections are contiguously numbered across segments, starting from 1, according to the order they appear in the `LC_SEGMENT` load commands.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nuint8_t n_sect;\n```\n\n## Fields\n\n- **n_un**: A union that holds an index into the string table, `n_strx`. To specify an empty string (`\"\"`), set this value to 0. The `n_name` field is not used in Mach-O files.\n- **n_type**: A byte value consisting of data accessed using four bit masks:\n- **n_desc**: A 16-bit value providing additional information about the nature of this symbol for non-stab symbols. The reference flags can be accessed using the `REFERENCE_TYPE` mask (0xF) and are defined as follows:\n- **n_value**: An integer that contains the value of the symbol. The format of this value is different for each type of symbol table entry (as specified by the `n_type` field). For the `N_SECT` symbol type, `n_value` is the address of the symbol. See the description of the `n_type` field for information on other possible values.\n\n",
