The tap mode will join together (bit or) the modes of all bpf devices using that interface for that dlt. If you return an error from this function, the bpf device attach attempt that triggered the tap will fail. If this function was called bacuse the tap state was decreasing (tap in or out is stopping), the error will be ignored.",
