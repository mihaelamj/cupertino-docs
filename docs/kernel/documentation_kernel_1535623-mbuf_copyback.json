The mbuf chain will be shorter than expected but all of the data up to the end of the mbuf chain will be valid.\n\nIf an offset is specified, mbuf_copyback will skip that many bytes in the mbuf chain before starting to write the buffer in to the chain. If the mbuf chain does not contain this many bytes, mbufs will be allocated to create the space.",
