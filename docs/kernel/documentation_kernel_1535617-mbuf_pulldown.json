Upon success, this will be overwritten with the offset from the mbuf returned in location.\n- **length**: The length of data that should be made contiguous.\n- **location**: Upon success, *location will be the mbuf the data is in.\n\n## Return Value\n\n0 upon success otherwise the errno error.\n\n## Discussion\n\nMake length bytes at offset in the mbuf chain contiguous. Nothing before offset bytes in the chain will be modified. Upon return, location will be the mbuf the data is contiguous in and offset will be the offset in that mbuf at which the data is located.
