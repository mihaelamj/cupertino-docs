Do not free an object in use and do not release the object anymore times than you have retained it.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nvirtual void freeCommand(\n IOATACommand *inCommand); \n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **inCommand**: the command to be released.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **allocCommand**: create IOATACommands. Device drivers should allocate command objects only through this method.\n- **executeCommand**: Submit IO requests\n- **getDeviceType**: Find out what kind of device this nub is (ata or atapi)\n- **getUnitID**: Determine whether this device is number 0 or 1 (ie, primary\/secondary)\n- **matchLocation**: matching stuff for IOBSDInit and so on.\n- **matchPropertyTable(OSDictionary *)**: matching stuff for IOBSDInit and so on.\n- **matchPropertyTable(OSDictionary *, SInt32 *)**: matching stuff for IOBSDInit and so on.\n- **notifyEvent**: called by controllers when they need to send a message to client (disk) drivers.\n- **provideBusInfo**: Find out the bus capability so the client can choose the features to set and commands to run.\n- **provideConfig**: Find out what speed the bus has configured for this unit.\n- **selectConfig**: Tell the bus what speed to use for your device.\n\n",
