If UPL is NULL, then it means the filesystem has opted into VFC_VFSVNOP_PAGEOUTV2 semantics, which means that it will create and operate on its own UPLs as opposed to relying on the one passed down into the filesystem. This means that the filesystem must be responsible for N cluster_pageout calls for N dirty ranges in the UPL.\n- **pl_offset**: Offset in UPL from which to start paging out data. Under the new VFC_VFSVNOP_PAGEOUTV2 semantics, this is the offset in the range specified that must be paged out if the associated page is dirty.\n- **f_offset**: Offset in file of data needing to be paged out. Under the new VFC_VFSVNOP_PAGEOUTV2 semantics, this represents the offset in the file where we should start looking for dirty pages.\n- **size**: Amount of data to page out (in bytes). Under VFC_VFSVNOP_PAGEOUTV2, this represents the size of the range to be considered. The fileystem is free to extend or shrink the specified range to better fit its blocking model as long as the page at 'pl_offset' is included.\n- **flags**: UPL-style flags: UPL_IOSYNC, UPL_NOCOMMIT, UPL_NORDAHEAD, UPL_VNODE_PAGER, UPL_MSYNC. Filesystems should generally leave it to the cluster layer to handle these flags. See the memory_object_types.h header in the kernel framework if interested.\n- **ctx**: Context to authenticate for pageout request.\n\n",
