Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nbool supportsDMA(\n void ); \n```\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **atabusinfo**: factory method\n- **getDMAModes**: bit-significant map of DMA mode(s) supported on the bus. Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus.\n- **getPIOModes**: returns the bit-significant map of PIO mode(s) supported on the bus. Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus.\n- **getSocketType**: returns the socket type, internal fixed, media-bay, PC-Card Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus\n- **getUltraModes**: bit-significant map of Ultra mode(s) supported on the bus. Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus.\n- **getUnits**: How many devices are present on bus. Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus.\n- **maxBlocksExtended**: The maximum number of 512-byte blocks this controller supports in a single Extended LBA transfer. Some controllers may be limited to less than the maximum sector count allowed under extended LBA protocol.\n- **setDMAModes**: Bit significant map of supported transfer modes. Set by ATAControllers.\n- **setDMAQueued**: Set true if supports DMA Queued Feature. Set by ATAControllers.\n- **setExtendedLBA**: Set true for supports 48-bit LBA. Set by ATAControllers.\n- **setMaxBlocksExtended**: value set by controllers to indicate the maximum number of blocks allowed in a single transfer of data. Some dma engines may not be capable of supporting the full 16-bit worth of sector count allowed under 48 bit extended LBA. Default is 256 blocks, same as standard ATA.\n- **setOverlapped**: Set true for supports overlapped packet feature set. Set by ATAControllers.\n- **setPIOModes**: Bit significant map of supported transfer modes. Set by ATAControllers.\n- **setSocketType**: internal fixed, media-bay, PC-Card. Set by ATAControllers.\n- **setUltraModes**: Bit significant map of supported transfer modes. Set by ATAControllers.\n- **setUnits**: set to indicate how many devices are on this bus. Set by ATAControllers.\n- **supportsDMAQueued**: Supports DMA Queued Feature set if true. Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus.\n- **supportsExtendedLBA**: Supports 48-bit LBA if true. Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus.\n- **supportsOverlapped**: Supports overlapped packet feature set if true. Used by clients of ATAControllers to find out about the bus.\n- **zeroData**: set this object to a blank state.\n\n",
