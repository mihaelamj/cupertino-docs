In the case of a callout, that function is expected to take care of cleaning up and freeing the buffer. Otherwise, if the buffer is marked B_ASYNC (e.g. it was passed to buf_bawrite()), then buf_biodone() considers itself justified in calling buf_brelse() to return it to free lists--no one is waiting for it.
