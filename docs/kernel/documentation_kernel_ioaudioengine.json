  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn IOAudioEngine is defined by a single I\/O engine to transfer data to or from one or more sample buffers. Each sample buffer is represented by a single IOAudioStream instance. A single IOAudioEngine must contain at least one IOAudioStream, but has no upper limit on the number of IOAudioStreams it may contain. An IOAudioEngine instance may contain both input and output IOAudioStreams.\n\nAn audio driver must subclass IOAudioEngine in order to provide certain services. An IOAudioEngine subclass must start and stop the I\/O engine when requested. The I\/O engine should be continuously running and loop around from end to beginning. While the audio engine is running, it must take a timestamp as the sample buffer(s) wrap around and start at the beginning. The CoreAudio.framework uses the timestamp to calculate the exact position of the audio engine. An IOAudioEngine subclass must implement getCurrentSampleFrame() to provide a sample position on demand. Finally, an IOAudioEngine subclass must provide clipping and format conversion routines to go to\/from the CoreAudio.framework's native float format.\n\nIf multiple stream formats or sample rates are allowed, the IOAudioEngine subclass must provide support for changing the hardware when a format or sample rate is changed.\n\nThere are several attributes associated with a single IOAudioEngine:\n\nThe IOAudioEngine superclass provides a shared status buffer that contains all of the dynamic pieces of information about the audio engine (type IOAudioEngineStatus). It runs an erase process on all of the output streams. The erase head is used to zero out the mix and sample buffers after the samples have been played. Additionally, the IOAudioEngine superclass handles the communication with the CoreAudio.framework and makes the decision to start and stop the audio engine when it detects it is in use.\n\nIn order for an audio device to play back or record sound, an IOAudioEngine subclass must be created. The subclass must initialize all of the necessary hardware resources to prepare for starting the audio I\/O engine. It typically will perform these tasks in the initHardware() method. A subclass may also implement a stop() method which is called as the driver is being torn down. This is typically called in preparation of removing the device from the system for removable devices.\n\nIn addition to initializing the necessary hardware, there are a number of other tasks an IOAudioEngine must do during initHardware(). It must create the necessary IOAudioStream objects to match the device capabilities. Each IOAudioStream must be added using addAudioStream(). It also should create the IOAudioControls needed to control the various attributes of the audio engine: output volume, mute, input gain, input selection, analog passthru. To do that, addDefaultAudioControl() should be called with each IOAudioControl to be attached to the IOAudioEngine. In order to provide for proper synchronization, the latency of the audio engine should be specified with setSampleLatency(). This value represents the latency between the timestamp taken at the beginning of the buffer and when the audio is actually played (or recorded) by the device.
