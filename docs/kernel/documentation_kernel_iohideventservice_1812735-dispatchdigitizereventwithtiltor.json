This is typically used to determine the distance between the transducer and surface\n- **tipPressure**: Absolute pressure exerted on surface by tip from 0.0 to 1.0 in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **auxPressure**: Absolute pressure exerted on transducer from 0.0 to 1.0 in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **twist**: Absolute clockwise rotation along the transducer's major axis from 0.0 to 360.0 degrees in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **tiltX**: Absolute plane angle between the Y-Z plane and the plane containing the transducer axis and the Y axis. A positive X tilt is to the right. Value is represented in degrees from -90.0 to 90.0 in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **tiltY**: Absolute plane angle between the X-Z plane and the plane containing the transducer axis and the X axis. A positive Y tilt is towards the user. Value is represented in degrees from -90.0 to 90.0 in 16:16 fixed point.\n- **options**: Additional options to be used when dispatching event.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is meant to be used with transducers that leverage tilt orientation\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n- **dispatchDigitizerEvent**: Dispatch tablet events without orientation\n- **dispatchDigitizerEventWithPolarOrientation**: Dispatch tablet events with polar orientation\n- **dispatchMultiAxisPointerEvent**: Dispatch multi-axis pointer event\n- **handleClose**: Handle a client close on the interface.\n- **handleIsOpen**: Query whether a client has an open on the interface.\n- **handleOpen**: Handle a client open on the interface.\n- **handleStart**: Prepare the hardware and driver to support I\/O operations.\n- **handleStop**: Quiesce the hardware and stop the driver.\n\n",
