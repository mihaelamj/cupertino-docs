The data store calls on its delegate to build the missing context.\n\nFor privacy reasons, and depending on factors like the user’s role as student, teacher, or unmanaged user, the data store may or may not keep a persistent copy of a context returned by the delegate. As a result, it’s impossible to predict from within your app which context requests might result in a delegate callback.
