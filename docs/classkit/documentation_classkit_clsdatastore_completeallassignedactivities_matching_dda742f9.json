The `contextPath` is the same identifier path you use for a call to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.classkit\/documentation\/ClassKit\/CLSDataStore\/contexts(matchingIdentifierPath:completion:)] method, but affects only the last context in the path.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSchoolwork displays a per-student Done indicator to teachers, along with statistics about task completion for the entire class.
