  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo set up your Apple developer account and Xcode to implement Apple Pay in your apps, you complete three steps:\n\n### Create a merchant identifier\n\nTo enable your app to use Apple Pay, register an identifier with Apple that uniquely identifies your business as a merchant able to accept payments. This ID never expires, and you can use it in multiple websites and apps. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/configure-app-capabilities\/configure-apple-pay#create-a-merchant-identifier] for the setup steps.\n\n### Create a payment processing certificate\n\nUsing your registered merchant identifier, create a certificate to secure transaction data. Apple Pay servers use the certificate’s public key to encrypt payment data. You (or your payment service provider) use the private key to decrypt the data to process payments. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/configure-app-capabilities\/configure-apple-pay#create-a-payment-processing-certificate] for the setup steps.\n\n### Enable Apple Pay capability in Xcode\n\nAfter creating a merchant identifier, enable the Apple Pay capability in your Xcode project.\n\nThe screenshot below shows the Apple Pay capability without any merchant identifiers:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app].\n\n### Configure Apple Pay on the web\n\nIf you’re also developing websites using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ApplePayontheWeb], you can use the same merchant ID and Payment Processing Certificate for your website. However, Apple Pay on the web requires additional setup; see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ApplePayontheWeb\/configuring-your-environment], [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/tech-talks\/111381], and the [http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/apple-pay\/Apple-Pay-Merchant-Integration-Guide.pdf] for more information.",
