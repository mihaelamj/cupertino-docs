To make it easier for people to add a payment pass to Apple Pay directly within Apple Wallet, Apple Pay offers extensions for in-app provisioning, called Wallet Extensions. Wallet Extensions improve discoverability of the option to add an issued card to Apple Wallet, as people can tap a button within Apple Wallet to begin a provisioning experience that doesn’t require them to enter details manually.\n\nUse this sample as a guide for developing the Wallet Extensions feature. The feature relies on two extensions, a UI extension and a non-UI extension. The issuer app needs a non-UI extension to report on the status of the extension and passes the app has available to add, and to perform the card data lookup—just like when adding payment passes to Apple Wallet from within the issuer app via in-app provisioning.\n\nAs for the UI extension, the issuer app needs a UI extension to perform user authentication if the non-UI extension reports that authentication is required. The UI extension isn’t a redirect to the issuer app, but a separate screen that uses the same issuer app login credentials.\n\nThe project contains four targets:\n\nFor more information on Wallet Extensions, see the [https:\/\/applepaydemo.apple.com\/wallet-extensions].\n\n### Configure the sample code project\n\nBecause Wallet Extensions require an entitlement from Apple, you can’t run the app extensions in this sample.
