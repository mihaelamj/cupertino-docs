To order the widgets that appear in the Smart Stack, watchOS attempts to determine a widget’s relevance based on several factors, including contextual clues your app provides to the system.\n\nTo give your widget additional visibility in the watchOS Smart Stack and ensure it appears when a person needs it, use RelevanceKit to provide contextual clues that signal the widget’s relevance to the system. For example, your widget might be most useful at a specific location or time, or every time a person starts a workout.\n\nNote that you use RelevanceKit in combination with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppIntents] to provide interactive and contextually relevant widgets in the Smart Stack, including iPhone widgets that appear on Apple Watch. When you add an import statement for App Intents to your code, App Intents implicitly adds a dependence to RelevanceKit . You don’t need to explicitly add `import RelevanceKit` to your code.\n\nFor more information, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Widget-Suggestions-In-Smart-Stacks].",
