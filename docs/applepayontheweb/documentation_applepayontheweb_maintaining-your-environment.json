While your merchant ID never expires, certificates and domain verification do expire, as follows:\n\n### View Expiration Dates and Update Certificates\n\nYou can view expiration dates and update your certificates on the Apple developer website by following these steps:\n\nCertificate expiration dates appear for each of the certificates listed on the page. You can also update the certificates on this page.\n\n### Renew Your Domain Verification\n\nDomain verification expires on the same date that your domain’s SSL certificate expires. Apple servers check if SSL certificates have been renewed at 30, 15, and 7 days before expiration.\n\nMake sure that the Apple servers — listed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ApplePayontheWeb\/setting-up-your-server#Allow-Apple-IP-Addresses-for-Domain-Verification] — can access the URL you used to validate the merchant domain. If the URL is behind a proxy or redirect the Apple servers won’t be able to access it. The URL may be similar to `https:\/\/yourdomain.com\/.well-known\/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`.",

While your merchant ID never expires, certificates and domain verification do expire, as follows:\n\n- The Payment Processing certificate expires every 25 months.\n- The Merchant Identity certificate expires every 25 months.\n- A registered domain’s verification expires when its SSL certificate expires.\n\n\n\n### View Expiration Dates and Update Certificates\n\nYou can view expiration dates and update your certificates on the Apple developer website by following these steps:\n\n- Sign in to your account — you need to be an Account Holder or Admin.\n- Open the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/ios\/certificate\/] page.\n- Under Identifiers, select Merchant IDs.\n- Select your domain’s  ID and select Edit.\n\nCertificate expiration dates appear for each of the certificates listed on the page. You can also update the certificates on this page.\n\n### Renew Your Domain Verification\n\nDomain verification expires on the same date that your domain’s SSL certificate expires. Apple servers check if SSL certificates have been renewed at 30, 15, and 7 days before expiration.\n\n- If you update the SSL certificate before it expires, Apple detects the renewed certificate and the domain remains verified. No further action is required on your part.\n- If the SSL certificate expires and is not replaced before expiring, you must redo domain verification in your Apple Developer Account. See [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/developer-account\/#\/dev1731126fb] for additional information.\n\nMake sure that the Apple servers — listed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ApplePayontheWeb\/setting-up-your-server#Allow-Apple-IP-Addresses-for-Domain-Verification] — can access the URL you used to validate the merchant domain. If the URL is behind a proxy or redirect the Apple servers won’t be able to access it.
