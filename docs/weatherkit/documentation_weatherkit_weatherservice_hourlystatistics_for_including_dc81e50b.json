Each item returned represents statistics for a particular hour of the year, in UTC. For example, if the hours of December 31, UTC time, are within the span, the statistics returned for those particular hours will be taken from data recorded over the years for hours 8737 to 8760 of the year, or 8761 to 8784 if December 31 of the span falls on a leap year.\n\nThis is a variadic API in which any combination of data sets can be requested and returned as a tuple.
