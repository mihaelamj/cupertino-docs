For example, if December 31, UTC time, is within the span, the statistics returned for that particular day will be taken from data recorded over the years for day 365 of the year, or 366 if December 31 of the span falls on a leap year.\n\nThis is a variadic API in which any combination of data sets can be requested and returned as a tuple.
