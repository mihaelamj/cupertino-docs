  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe source for your pass includes all the information the system needs to show it to the user:\n\nCreate the source in a directory that you use to create the final distributable pass [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle]. For information on building a pass from the source, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.walletpasses\/documentation\/WalletPasses\/building-a-pass].\n\n### Create the Directory and add Files for the Pass\n\nFirst create a directory to hold all the source files. The name of the directory is the name of the final pass file followed by `.pass`. For example, `Lift It Membership.pass` is the name of the top-level directory for the source of the Lift It membership pass.\n\nAdd the `pass.json` file that contains the information and metadata for the pass. For more information on the contents of this file, see the top-level [doc:\/\/com.apple.walletpasses\/documentation\/WalletPasses\/Pass] object.\n\nThe following figure shows the directory structure for a simple pass that’s localized for English and Simplified Chinese:\n\n\n\n### Add the images for the Pass\n\nCustomize the look of your pass by using images for a logo and other items. All passes require an icon:\n\nSome types of passes include other types of images, such as a background. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/UserExperience\/Conceptual\/PassKit_PG\/Creating.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40012195-CH4-SW1]\n\n### Add Localization to the Pass\n\nExpand your audience by localizing the strings and images of your pass to different languages and regions.\n\n\n\nAdd a directory at the top-level source directory of each pass for each localization. The name of the directory identifies the language and an optional region:\n\n`[language identifier]-[region identifier].lproj`\n\nFor example, the name for the French localization directory is `fr.lproj`, and the name for the Simplified Chinese directory is `zh-Hans.lproj`. For more information on language identifiers, see `Understand the Language Identifier`.\n\nLocalize an image by adding the location-specific image files to each localization directory. For example, to add the localized versions of the diamond logo shown above, add the English version of the `logo@2x.png` and `logo@3x.png` files to the `en.lproj` folder and the Chinese version of the `logo@2x.png` and `logo@3x.png` files to the `zh-Hans.lproj` folder. Each folder must contain the same number of resolutions for an image.\n\n### Localize the Strings\n\nWhen a user opens a pass, the system localizes displayed strings in two different ways. The system localizes pass fields that contain dates, times, and currencies that use standard formats in the `pass.json` file. For example, in the pass shown above, the expiration date value is an ISO 8601 date in [doc:\/\/com.apple.walletpasses\/documentation\/WalletPasses\/PassFieldContent]:\n\nThe system always displays localized versions of these values, even when your pass doesn’t contain localization folders for the language. For example, the figure below shows a pass that contains localizations for English and Simplified Chinese displayed on a device set to the Arabic language. The system only localizes the date:\n\n\n\nThe system localizes other strings on your pass using a *strings file* which contains a list of keys and associated localized strings. Add localized strings to your pass in three steps:\n\nFor example, the following three code snippets show the code to localize the offer label and offer text of the passes shown above to English and to Simplified Chinese.\n\nSet the value of the strings in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.walletpasses\/documentation\/WalletPasses\/PassFields\/PrimaryFields-data.dictionary] object in the `pass.json` file to the keys you use to show a localized string in the `pass.strings` files`:`\n\nSet the English strings in `en.lproj\/pass.strings`:\n\nSet the Simplified Chinese strings in `zh-Hans.lproj\/pass.strings`:\n\nUse UTF-16 encoding for non-ASCII characters.",
