When the user taps to grant or deny access, the completion handler will be called on an arbitrary queue. Your app isn’t blocked while the user decides to grant or deny permission.\n\nAfter users choose their permission level, the event store either calls the completion handler or broadcasts an [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKEventStoreChangedNotification].
