To make an event recurring, assign it a recurrence rule that describes when the event occurs. Recurrence rules are represented by instances of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceRule] class.\n\nRecurrence is applicable to both calendar events and reminders. Unlike with recurring events, only the first incomplete reminder of a recurring set is obtainable. This is true with EventKit as well as the Reminders app. When the reminder is completed, the next reminder in the recurrence set becomes available.\n\n### Create a Basic Rule\n\nYou can create a recurrence rule with a simple daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly pattern using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceRule\/init(recurrenceWith:interval:end:)] method. You provide three values to this method:\n\n- **The recurrence frequency.** This is a value of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceFrequency] that indicates whether the recurrence rule is daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.\n- **The recurrence interval.** This is an integer greater than `0` that specifies how often a pattern repeats. For example, if the recurrence rule is a weekly recurrence rule and its interval is `1`, then the pattern repeats every week. If the recurrence rule is a monthly recurrence rule and its interval is `3`, then the pattern repeats every three months.\n- **The recurrence end.** This optional parameter is an instance of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceEnd] class, which indicates when the recurrence rule ends. The recurrence end can be based on a specific end date or on an amount of occurrences. If you don’t want to specify an end for the recurrence rule, pass `nil`.\n\n### Create a Complex Rule\n\nYou can create a recurrence rule with a complex pattern using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceRule\/init(recurrenceWith:interval:daysOfTheWeek:daysOfTheMonth:monthsOfTheYear:weeksOfTheYear:daysOfTheYear:setPositions:end:)] method. As for a basic recurrence rule, you provide a frequency, interval, and optional end for the recurring event.
