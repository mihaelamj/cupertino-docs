Can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.\n- **interval**: The interval between instances of this recurrence. For example, a weekly recurrence rule with an interval of `2` occurs every other week. Must be greater than `0`.\n- **days**: The days of the week that the event occurs, as an array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceDayOfWeek] objects.\n- **monthDays**: The days of the month that the event occurs, as an array of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNumber] objects. Values can be from `1` to `31` and from `-1` to `-31`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceFrequency\/monthly].\n- **months**: The months of the year that the event occurs, as an array of `NSNumber` objects. Values can be from `1` to `12`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceFrequency\/yearly].\n- **weeksOfTheYear**: The weeks of the year that the event occurs, as an array of `NSNumber` objects. Values can be from `1` to `53` and from `-1` to `-53`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceFrequency\/yearly].\n- **daysOfTheYear**: The days of the year that the event occurs, as an array of `NSNumber` objects. Values can be from `1` to `366` and from `-1` to `-366`. This parameter is only valid for recurrence rules of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceFrequency\/yearly].\n- **setPositions**: An array of ordinal numbers that filters which recurrences to include in the recurrence rule’s frequency. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.eventkit\/documentation\/EventKit\/EKRecurrenceRule\/setPositions] for more information.\n- **end**: The end of the recurrence rule.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe initialized recurrence rule, or `nil` if invalid values are provided.\n\n## Discussion\n\nNegative values indicate counting backwards from the end of the recurrence rule’s frequency.\n\n",
