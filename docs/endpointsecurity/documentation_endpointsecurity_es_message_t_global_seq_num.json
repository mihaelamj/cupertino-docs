If the kernel doesn’t drop any events for this client, `global_seq_num` increments by 1 for every message.\n\nTo determine whether the kernel dropped events, compare the previous value of `global_seq_num` to the value received in the latest message. When the kernel drops no events, the difference is 1, since the current message increments the counter. You can therefore calculate the number of dropped messages as follows:\n\nDropped events generally indicate that the kernel generated more events than the client could handle.\n\nThis field is available if the message version is greater than `4`.",
