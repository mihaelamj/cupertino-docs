All initializers in frameworks that link to you.\n\nIn addition:\n\n- A class’s `+load` method is called after all of its superclasses’ `+load` methods.\n- A category `+load` method is called after the class’s own `+load` method.\n\nIn a custom implementation of [doc:\/\/com.apple.objectivec\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class\/load()] you can therefore safely message other unrelated classes from the same image, but any [doc:\/\/com.apple.objectivec\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/NSObject-swift.class\/load()] methods implemented by those classes may not have run yet.\n\n\n\n## Initializing a Class\n\n- **initialize()**: Initializes the class before it receives its first message.\n\n",
