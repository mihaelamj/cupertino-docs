Contains pointers to recently used methods.\n\n## Overview\n\nTo limit the need to perform linear searches of method lists for the definitions of frequently accessed methods—an operation that can considerably slow down method lookup—the Objective-C runtime functions store pointers to the definitions of the most recently called method of the class in an `objc_cache` data structure.\n\n## Fields\n\n- **mask**: An integer specifying the total number of allocated cache buckets (minus one). During method lookup, the Objective-C runtime uses this field to determine the index at which to begin a linear search of the `buckets` array. A pointer to a method’s selector is masked against this field using a logical AND operation (`index = (mask & selector))`. This serves as a simple hashing algorithm.\n- **occupied**: An integer specifying the total number of occupied cache buckets.\n- **buckets**: An array of pointers to [doc:\/\/com.apple.objectivec\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/Method] data structures. This array may contain no more than `mask + 1` items. Note that pointers may be `NULL`, indicating that the cache bucket is unoccupied, and occupied buckets may not be contiguous. This array may grow over time.\n\n## Class-Definition Data Structures\n\n- **Method**: An opaque type that represents a method in a class definition.\n- **Ivar**: An opaque type that represents an instance variable.\n- **Category**: An opaque type that represents a category.\n- **objc_property_t**: An opaque type that represents an Objective-C declared property.\n- **IMP**: A pointer to the start of a method implementation.\n- **objc_method_description**: Defines an Objective-C method.\n- **objc_property_attribute_t**: Defines a property attribute.\n\n",
