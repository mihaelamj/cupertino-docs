To make use of the default implementation, you must therefore implement and register a suitable class description—see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSClassDescription].\n\nFor example, suppose an Employee class has a relationship named `department` to a Department class, and that Department has a relationship called `employees` to Employee. The statement:\n\nreturns the string `employees`.",
