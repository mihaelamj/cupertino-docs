  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe nib-loading infrastructure sends an `awakeFromNib` message to each object recreated from a nib archive, but only after all the objects in the archive have been loaded and initialized. When an object receives an `awakeFromNib` message, it is guaranteed to have all its outlet and action connections already established.\n\nYou must call the `super` implementation of `awakeFromNib` to give parent classes the opportunity to perform any additional initialization they require. Although the default implementation of this method does nothing, many UIKit classes provide non-empty implementations. You may call the `super` implementation at any point during your own `awakeFromNib` method.\n\nDuring the instantiation process, each object in the archive is unarchived and then initialized with the method befitting its type. Objects that conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSCoding] protocol (including all subclasses of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController]) are initialized using their `initWithCoder:` method. All objects that do not conform to the `NSCoding` protocol are initialized using their `init` method. After all objects have been instantiated and initialized, the nib-loading code reestablishes the outlet and action connections for all of those objects. It then calls the `awakeFromNib` method of the objects. For more detailed information about the steps followed during the nib-loading process, see Nib Files in Resource Programming Guide.\n\nTypically, you implement `awakeFromNib` for objects that require additional set up that cannot be done at design time. For example, you might use this method to customize the default configuration of any controls to match user preferences or the values in other controls. You might also use it to restore individual controls to some previous state of your application.",
