The object needs to implement the class methods described below to specify the properties and methods to export. Furthermore, a method is not exported if its return type and all its parameters are not Objective-C objects or scalars.\n\nMethod argument and return types that are Objective-C objects will be converted to appropriate types for the scripting environment. For example:\n\n- `nil` is converted to undefined.\n- `NSNumber` objects will be converted to JavaScript numbers.\n- `NSString` objects will be converted to JavaScript strings.\n- `NSArray` objects will be mapped to special read-only arrays.\n- `NSNull` will be converted to JavaScript’s `null`.\n- `WebUndefined` will be converted to undefined.\n- `WebScriptObject` instances will be unwrapped for the scripting environment.\n\nInstances of all other classes will be wrapped before being passed to the script, and unwrapped as they return to Objective-C. Primitive types such as `int` and `char` are cast to a numeric in JavaScript.\n\nAccess to an object’s attributes, such as instance variables, is managed by key-value coding (KVC).
