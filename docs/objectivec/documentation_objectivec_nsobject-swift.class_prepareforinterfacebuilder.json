You can implement this method in your designable classes and use it to configure their design-time appearance. For example, you might use the method to configure a custom text control with a default string. The system does not call this method; only Interface Builder calls it.\n\nInterface Builder waits until all objects in a graph have been created and initialized before calling this method. So if your object’s runtime configuration relies on subviews or parent views, those objects should exist by the time this method is called.\n\nYour implementation of this method must call `super` at some point so that parent classes can perform their own custom setup.",
