The type must match the type of the property identified by `key`. (See also the Discussion section.)\n\nFor example, if the property is a to-many relationship, `value` will always be an array of objects to be copied, and this method must therefore return an array of objects.\n- **key**: A key that identifies the relationship into which to insert the copied object or objects.\n- **properties**: The properties to be set in the copied object or objects.  Derived from the “with properties” parameter of a `duplicate` command. (See also the Discussion section.)\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe copied object or objects.
