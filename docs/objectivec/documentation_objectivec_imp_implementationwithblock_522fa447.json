The signature of `block` should be `method_return_type ^(id self, method_args …)`. The selector of the method is not available to `block`. `block` is copied with `Block_copy()`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.objectivec\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/IMP] that calls `block`. You must dispose of the returned [doc:\/\/com.apple.objectivec\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/IMP] using the function.\n\n## Using Objective-C Language Features\n\n- **objc_enumerationMutation(_:)**: Inserted by the compiler when a mutation is detected during a foreach iteration.\n- **objc_setEnumerationMutationHandler(_:)**: Sets the current mutation handler.\n- **imp_getBlock(_:)**: Returns the block associated with an `IMP` that was created using [doc:\/\/com.apple.objectivec\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/imp_implementationWithBlock(_:)].\n- **imp_removeBlock(_:)**: Disassociates a block from an `IMP` that was created using [doc:\/\/com.apple.objectivec\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/imp_implementationWithBlock(_:)], and releases the copy of the block that was created.\n- **objc_loadWeak(_:)**: Loads the object referenced by a weak pointer and returns it.\n- **objc_storeWeak(_:_:)**: Stores a new value in a `__weak` variable.\n\n",
