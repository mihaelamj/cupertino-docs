During method lookup, the Objective-C runtime uses this field to determine the index at which to begin a linear search of the `buckets` array. A pointer to a method’s selector is masked against this field using a logical AND operation (`index = (mask & selector))`. This serves as a simple hashing algorithm.\n- **buckets**: An array of pointers to [doc:\/\/com.apple.objectivec\/documentation\/ObjectiveC\/Method] data structures. This array may contain no more than `mask + 1` items. Note that pointers may be `NULL`, indicating that the cache bucket is unoccupied, and occupied buckets may not be contiguous. This array may grow over time.\n\n",
