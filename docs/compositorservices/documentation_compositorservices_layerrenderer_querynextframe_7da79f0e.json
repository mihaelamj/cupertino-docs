The system maintains a limited number of frames, so don’t try to render more than one frame in advance. If this function returns `nil`, wait a short time and try again. When the system finishes displaying a rendered frame, it returns that frame to the shared pool and makes it available for you to use again.\n\nThe index of each returned frame is always greater than the index of the previous frame.
