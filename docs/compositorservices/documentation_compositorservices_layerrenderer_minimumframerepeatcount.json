For example, if this value is `1`, the layer displays the same content for the duration of two screen update cycles.\n\nUse this value to determine the pacing of your drawing operations. A higher repeat count increases the amount of time you have to render each frame, and decreases the amount of power your app uses per frame. However, higher repeat counts also mean your content updates less frequently.",
