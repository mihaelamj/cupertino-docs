Use the layer to start your rendering loop and deliver successive frames of content. The layer provides the timing information you need to deliver frames at the refresh rate of the display. It also provides the Metal textures and other information that you need to draw content on the device displays.\n\nFor more information about how to draw your app’s content using Metal, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Metal].",
