You typically draw only one frame at a time, starting work on each new frame only after completing the previous frame.\n\nSeparate the work you do for each frame into two phases: the update phase and the encode phase. Use the update phase to perform tasks that don’t depend on the current device pose. For example, you might update your app’s data structures to reflect recent interactions with your content. Use the submission phase to retrieve the current pose and render the frame’s content using that information.
