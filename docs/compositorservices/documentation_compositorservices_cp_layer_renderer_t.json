When you present an immersive space with [doc:\/\/com.apple.compositorservices\/documentation\/CompositorServices\/CompositorLayer] content, the system creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.compositorservices\/documentation\/CompositorServices\/LayerRenderer] type and makes it available to the content’s closure. Use the information in the layer to set up your app’s rendering loop, and to start drawing frames of content.\n\nEach layer has information that tells the system how to configure the Metal textures and data types your app needs. Compositor Services provides a default configuration for layers, but you can customize the configuration of your layer as needed. Specify your custom configuration details using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.compositorservices\/documentation\/CompositorServices\/CompositorLayerConfiguration] protocol and pass a type with those details to the initializer for your immersive space’s content . Use the layer’s capability information to validate any configuration choices you make.\n\nFor information about how to create and configure a layer and use it to run your rendering loop, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.compositorservices\/documentation\/CompositorServices\/drawing-fully-immersive-content-using-metal].",
