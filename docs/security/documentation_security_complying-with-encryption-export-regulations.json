If you distribute your app outside the U.S. or Canada, your app is subject to U.S. export laws, regardless of where your legal entity is based. If your app uses, accesses, contains, implements, or incorporates encryption, this is considered an export of encryption software, which means your app is subject to U.S. export compliance requirements, as well as the import compliance requirements of the countries where you distribute your app.\n\nEvery time you submit a new version of your app, App Store Connect asks you questions to guide you through a compliance review. You can bypass these questions and streamline the submission process by providing the required information in your app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List] file.\n\nFor more information about export compliance, read [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/#\/dev88f5c7bf9].\n\n### Declare Your App’s Use of Encryption\n\nAdd the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption] key to your app’s information property list with a Boolean value that indicates whether your app uses encryption. Set the value to `NO` if your app—including any third-party libraries it links against—doesn’t use encryption, or if it only uses forms of encryption that are exempt from export compliance documentation requirements. Otherwise, set it to `YES`.\n\n\n\nTypically, the use of encryption that’s built into the operating system—for example, when your app makes HTTPS connections using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSession]—is exempt from export documentation upload requirements, whereas the use of proprietary encryption is not. To determine whether your use of encryption is considered exempt, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-app-information\/determine-and-upload-app-encryption-documentation].\n\n### Provide Compliance Documentation\n\nIf your app requires export compliance documentation, upload the required items to App Store Connect, as described in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-app-information\/determine-and-upload-app-encryption-documentation].
