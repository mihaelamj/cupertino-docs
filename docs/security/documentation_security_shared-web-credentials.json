Users often save their username and password in their iCloud keychain when logging into websites in Safari. Later, they may run a native app from the same developer to access the same account. With shared web credentials, the app can access the credentials stored for the website instead of requiring the user to reenter a username and password. Users can also create new accounts, update passwords, or delete their accounts from within the app. These changes are then saved and used by Safari.\n\n",
