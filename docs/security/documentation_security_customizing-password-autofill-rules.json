If you don’t include the allowed property, all the required characters are permitted. If you include both properties, all the allowed and required characters are permitted. If neither are specified, then all ASCII printable characters are permitted\n- **Character Classes:** Use a combination of `upper` (A-Z), `lower` (a-z), `digits` (0-9), `special` (-~!@#$%^&*_+=`|(){}[:;”’<>,.? ] and space), `ascii-printable` (all ASCII printable characters), or `unicode` (all unicode characters).\n- **Maximum Length Key:** Use `max-consecutive` to specify the maximum length of consecutive characters in your password. If you have multiple `max-consecutive` properties in your rule, the minimum value of the properties will be applied. Without this property, the password can be of any length.\n- **Custom Character Class:** A `<character-class>` is a custom characters class. This property consists of a list of ASCII characters surrounded by square brackets. For example, `[abc]` only allows characters “a”, “b”, and “c”.\n- **Non-negative Integer Class:** A `<non-negative-integer>` is a valid non-negative integer. This property is used to specify the `max-consecutive` property, since the maximum length can’t be negative.\n\nThe default password rule is applied without any definition for the password rules property. It allows all ASCII printable characters, written as `allowed: ascii-printable`.\n\nYou can combine these keywords to form your rule. Duplicate property values, empty character classes, and properties without a value are ignored. Don’t specify the `pattern` property if using password rules. If you have two password fields (one for the password, one for confirmation), you don’t need to specify password rules for both fields when the user enters a new password.\n\n\n\nThe specified password length can’t be less than 12, and the allowed characters must consist of at least 2 of the following classes: ASCII uppercase letters, ASCII lowercase letters, and digits.
