The framework provides a set of APIs for reading and writing one or more files to a directory, while abstracting away iCloud concepts. It handles common save syncing scenarios like conflict resolution and offline play. Additionally, it provides a set of convenience UI alerts for these typical scenarios. GameSave also supports local saving for when the device isn’t signed into iCloud Drive.",
