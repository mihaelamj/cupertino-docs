Your server is responsible for parsing, interpreting, and responding to all server-to-server notification posts. For more information about responding, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responding-to-app-store-server-notifications].\n\nThe body of the POST contains the data elements described in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responseBodyV2] for version 2 notifications, and [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responseBodyV1] for version 1. Parse them using the following information:\n\n- The version 2 response body, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responseBodyV2], contains a [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/signedPayload] that’s cryptographically signed by the App Store in JSON Web Signature (JWS) format. The JWS format increases security and enables you to decode and validate the signature on your server.  Some notifications include a [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/data] object, which has transaction and subscription renewal information that the App Store signs in JWS. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI] and the StoreKit [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/in-app-purchase] API use the same JWS-signed format for transaction and subscription status information. For more information about JWS, see the [https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/html\/rfc7515] specification.\n- The version 1 response body, [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responseBodyV1], is a JSON object. It includes the receipt that contains the most recent in-app purchase transaction for the app. For more information, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/unified_receipt] object.\n\n\n\nUse the notification type along with the transaction and subscription renewal information to update a user’s service or present promotional offers according to your business logic. For information on handling notifications that contain an external purchase token, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/externalPurchaseToken].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Enabling App Store Server Notifications**: Configure your server and provide an HTTPS URL to receive notifications about in-app purchase events and unreported external purchase tokens.\n- **Responding to App Store Server Notifications**: Send HTTP status codes to indicate the success of a notification post.\n- **App Store Server Notifications changelog**: Learn about changes to the App Store Server Notifications service.\n\n",
