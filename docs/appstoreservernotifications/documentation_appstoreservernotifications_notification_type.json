  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nYou receive and can react to server notifications in real time for the subscription and refund events that these notification type values describe. The `notification_type` appears in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responseBodyV1].\n\n### Handle use cases for notification events\n\nWhen events occur that affect the customer’s product and subscription life-cycle, your server receives notifications from the App Store. Here are some examples of product events and the server notifications you can expect to receive:\n\n### Receive notifications for the purchaser and family members\n\nThe following table identifies the notifications you receive for the purchaser and for their family members who share products through Family Sharing. To determine if a notification is for the purchaser or a family member, check the value of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/in_app_ownership_type] field, which appears in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/unified_receipt\/Latest_receipt_info-data.dictionary] of the `responseBody` object. For more information about Family Sharing, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/supporting-family-sharing-in-your-app].\n\nThe `CONSUMPTION_REQUEST` notification applies to consumable in-app purchases, which aren’t eligible for Family Sharing.\n\n### Test notification events with sandbox\n\nYour development-signed apps use the sandbox environment when you sign in to App Store using a Sandbox Apple Account. To create a Sandbox Apple Account or test account in App Store Connect, see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/#\/dev8b997bee1].\n\nIf you enabled App Store Server Notifications, test your logic for transactions in the sandbox environment. To determine if a notification for a subscription event occurred in the test environment, check whether the value of the `environment` field in the JSON [doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/responseBodyV1] object equals `Sandbox`.\n\nThe following notification types are available in sandbox: `INITIAL_BUY`, `DID_CHANGE_RENEWAL_PREF`, `DID_CHANGE_RENEWAL_STATUS`, `DID_RENEW`, `INTERACTIVE_RENEWAL`, `CANCEL`, and `REFUND`. Notifications in the sandbox environment are for the purchaser only, and have [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreReceipts\/in_app_ownership_type] equal to `PURCHASED`. For more information about testing in-app purchases, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/testing-in-app-purchases-with-sandbox].",
