Use HTTP status codes to indicate whether the App Store server notification post succeeded:\n\n- Send HTTP `200`, or any HTTP code between `200` and `206`, if the post was successful.\n- Send HTTP `50x` or `40x` to have the App Store retry the notification, if the post didn’t succeed.\n\nThe system considers all other HTTP codes an unsuccessful post. Your server isn’t required to return a data value.\n\nIf the App Store server doesn’t receive a success response from your server after the initial notification attempt, it retries as follows:\n\n- For version 2 notifications, it retries five times, at 1, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the previous attempt.\n- For version 1 notifications, it retries three times, at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the previous attempt.\n\n\n\n### Recover from server outages\n\nIf your server misses notifications due to an outage, you can always get up-to-date transaction information by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI] endpoints including [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Transaction-History] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-All-Subscription-Statuses].\n\nIf you use version 2 notifications ([doc:\/\/com.apple.appstoreservernotifications\/documentation\/AppStoreServerNotifications\/App-Store-Server-Notifications-V2]), you can recover missed notifications by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Get-Notification-History]. You can also test whether your server is receiving and responding to version 2 notifications correctly by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreServerAPI\/Request-a-Test-Notification] endpoint.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Enabling App Store Server Notifications**: Configure your server and provide an HTTPS URL to receive notifications about in-app purchase events and unreported external purchase tokens.\n- **Receiving App Store Server Notifications**: Implement server-side code to receive and parse notification posts.\n- **App Store Server Notifications changelog**: Learn about changes to the App Store Server Notifications service.\n\n",
