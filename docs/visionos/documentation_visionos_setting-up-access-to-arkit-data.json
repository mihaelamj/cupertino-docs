Add the following keys to your app’s information property list to provide a user-facing usage description that explains how your app uses the data:\n\n### Choose between up-front or as-needed authorization\n\nYou can choose when someone sees an authorization request to use ARKit data. If you need precise control over when the request appears, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARKitSession\/requestAuthorization(for:)] method on [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARKitSession] to explicitly authorize access at the time you call it. Otherwise, people see an authorization request when you call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARKitSession\/run(_:)] method. This is an implicit authorization because the timing of the request depends entirely on when you start the session.\n\n### Open a space and run a session\n\nTo help protect people’s privacy, ARKit data is available only when your app presents a Full Space and other apps are hidden. Present one of these space styles before calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ARKit\/ARKitSession\/run(_:)] method.\n\nThe following shows an app structure that’s set up to use a space with ARKit:\n\nCall [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/openImmersiveSpace] from your app’s user interface to create a space, start running an ARKit session, and kick off an immersive experience. The following shows a simple view with a button that opens the space:\n\n### Provide alternatives for declined and revoked authorizations\n\nSomeone might not want to give your app access to data from ARKit, or they might choose to revoke that access later in Settings. Handle these situations gracefully, and remove or transition content that depends on ARKit data. For example, you might fade out content that you need to remove, or recenter content to an appropriate starting position. If your app uses ARKit data to place content in a person’s surroundings, consider letting people place content using the system-provided interface.\n\nProviding alternatives is especially important if you’re using ARKit for user input. People using accessibility features, trackpads, keyboards, or other forms of input might need a way to use your app without ARKit.",
