  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nPerformance tuning is an important part of the development process, regardless of platform. Performance tuning means making your app run as efficiently as possible, so it does more work in less time and with fewer system resources. Efficiency is especially important on devices that can support multiple apps in an immersive experience. Apps that consume too many resources, can push the device beyond thermal limits. When this occurs, the system takes steps to cool down to a more acceptable level. This can have a noticeable visual impact and be disorienting for the wearer.\n\nAs you start development, set aggressive goals and evaluate progress throughout the development cycle. Automate the collection of performance metrics as much as possible and look at data over time to see if performance is improving or declining. When you detect a significant decrease in performance, take immediate steps to correct it. When you start fine-tuning early in development, you have more time to make needed changes to algorithms and approaches.\n\nFor more information on performance tuning, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/improving-your-app-s-performance].\n\n### Set performance and power targets\n\nPerformance isn’t a single metric that you measure and improve. Typically, you choose several metrics and set goals for each of them. For example, consider:\n\nAfter you choose the metrics you want, set realistic goals and prioritize them, so you know which ones matter the most. Performance tuning often involves making tradeoffs between competing goals. For example, if you reduce CPU usage by caching computed data or pre-load assets to improve responsiveness, you increase your app’s memory usage. Make these kinds of tradeoffs carefully, and always measure the results of any changes to learn whether they were successful. In some cases, you might find the sacrifice isn’t worthwhile.\n\nConsider how people will use your app. If your app runs in the Shared Space, consider more conservative targets and goals for system resources. If you expect people to use your app for longer periods of time, factor this extended use into your targets and goals when choosing metrics.\n\n### Identify the code flows and user scenarios to test\n\nAfter you choose the metrics to collect, decide which portions of your app to test. Choose features that are repeatable, measurable, and reliable to test. Repeatable automated tests allow you to compare the results and know the comparisons represent the exact same task. Focus on places where your app executes code, but don’t ignore places where your app hands off data to the system and waits. If your app spends a significant amount of time waiting for information, consider eliminating the requests altogether or batching them to achieve better performance.\n\nFocus your tuning efforts on the parts of your app that people use the most, or that have the most impact on overall system performance, including:\n\nChoose actions that people perform frequently or that correspond to important features. For example, if your app lets someone add a new contact, test the workflow for creating the contact, editing the contact, and saving the results. Test your app with a particular feature enabled and disabled to determine whether the feature is solely responsible for any performance impacts. Choose lightweight workflows such as how your app performs at idle time, and also heavyweight workflows, for example, ones that involve user interactions and your app’s responses. For launch times, gather metrics for both hot and cold launches — that is, when the app is already resident in memory and when it is not.\n\n### Consider thermal and environmental factors\n\nConsider how environmental factors impact your app. The characteristics of your physical environment can affect system load and thermals of the device. Consider the effect that ambient room temperature, the presence of other people, and the number and type of real-world objects can have on the your app‘s algorithms. Try to test in different settings to get an idea of whether you need to optimize for these scenarios or not.\n\nUse Xcode’s thermal inducers to mimic the device hitting its thermal limits and consider how your app responds to fair, serious, and critical thermal notifications. You might need to have different performance goals when under thermal pressure, and prioritize optimizing for power or find ways to dynamically lower your app‘s complexity in response to thermal pressure to give a smoother experience, even if latency is a bit higher.\n\n### Choose tools to collect performance data\n\nThere are many tools and APIs you can use to collect performance-related data for your visionOS app. Use a variety of tools to make sure you have the data you need:\n\n### Profile on a physical device\n\nIn general, profile and analyze performance on a physical device rather than in Simulator. Even if something works well in Simulator, it might not perform as well on devices for all use cases. Simulator doesn’t support some hardware features and APIs. There are differences in the rendering pipeline for Simulator running on macOS, so rendering performance characteristics will be different. Other pipelines such as input delivery and audio or video playback are also different. There are, however, some insights you can gain profiling in Simulator, such as CPU stalls, that help you spot areas to investigate and address.\n\n### Build automated test cases and run them regularly\n\nXcode comes with tools to help you automate the collection of performance data:\n\nConfigure Xcode to run test cases each time you build your app, or create a separate target to run test cases or custom scripts on demand. Integrate your performance tests into your Xcode Cloud workflows, or your own custom continuous integration solution.\n\nFor information about how to write test cases for your app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/testing].

Integrate these scripts into your project’s build process to automate their execution.\n\nConfigure Xcode to run test cases each time you build your app, or create a separate target to run test cases or custom scripts on demand. Integrate your performance tests into your Xcode Cloud workflows, or your own custom continuous integration solution.\n\n\n\nFor information about how to write test cases for your app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/testing].
