The main view creates text variations from this property in its methods and computed properties.\n\n### Create the foremost text view\n\nThe `textFrontView` property creates a variation of the `text` property, to act as the view that pops out the most, by changing its offset along the z-axis:\n\n```swift\nvar textFrontView: some View {\n    text.offset(z: Double(layerSpacing * layers) * animationProgress)\n}\n```\n\nThe sample achieves this by passing the largest value into the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/offset(z:)] modifier. The offset value, excluding the `animationProgress` value that controls the animation, is the product of the `layerSpacing` and `layers` properties:\n\n```swift\n\/\/\/ The number of text layers that extend from the window along its z-axis.\nlet layers = 5\n\n\/\/\/ The number of points between each layer.\nlet layerSpacing = 100\n```\n\n### Generate a series of text layers along the z-axis\n\nThe `textMiddleViews` property makes several variations of the `text` property to form the middle layers between the shadow and the front of the stack. It does this by creating a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ForEach] instance to generate the text views:\n\n```swift\nvar textMiddleViews: some View {\n    ForEach(1..<layers, id: \\.self) { layer in\n        let layerPercent = Double(layer) \/ Double(layers)\n        let maximumOffset = Double(layerSpacing * layers)\n        let maximumOpacity = 1.0\n\n        text\n            .offset(z: maximumOffset * layerPercent * animationProgress)\n            .opacity(maximumOpacity * layerPercent)\n    }\n}   \n```\n\nThe property dynamically applies a unique offset along the z-axis to each text view by passing a larger value to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/offset(z:)] modifier with each iteration. This offset creates a stacking effect that shows the text extending outward from the view window.\n\nThe `layers` property controls the number of iterations:\n\n```swift\nlet layers = 5\n```\n\n### Generate a shadow version of the text view\n\nThe `textShadowView` property makes a version of the `text` property that acts as a shadow by adding a blur effect and modifying its style and transparency:\n\n```swift\nvar textShadowView: some View {\n    \/\/\/ The width, in points, of the blur effect relative to the text's edges.\n    let blurRadius: CGFloat = 12\n    let maximumOpacity = 0.6\n\n    return text\n        .foregroundStyle(.black)\n        .blur(radius: blurRadius)\n        .opacity(maximumOpacity * animationProgress)\n}\n```\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/blur(radius:opaque:)] view modifier applies a Gaussian blur to the text view, and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Color\/opacity(_:)] view modifier makes the view semitransparent.\n\n\n\n### Stack the text with animations\n\nThe `DepthTextView` arranges its view properties along its z-axis by adding a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ZStack] as the main view of its `body` property:\n\n```swift\nvar body: some View {\n    \/\/ Create a stack of the same text view with different opacities and\n    \/\/ positions along the z-axes, starting with a blurry shadow version.\n    ZStack {\n        textShadowView\n        textMiddleViews\n        textFrontView\n    }\n    .onAppear(perform: animateWithSpringEffect)\n}\n```\n\nThe `textShadowView`, `textMiddleViews`, and `textFrontView` properties each create a version of the text. The sample adds an animation effect to its [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ZStack] by passing its `animateWithSpringEffect` method to the stack’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/onAppear(perform:)] view modifier.\n\nThe `animateWithSpringEffect` method animates the transition through the `animationProgress` property from `0.0` to `1.0` by:\n\n1. Creating a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Spring] instance.\n2. Creating an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Animation\/interpolatingSpring] animation with that spring.\n3.
