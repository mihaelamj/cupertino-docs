[Overview](\/documentation\/visionos\/creating-2d-shapes-in-visionos-with-swiftui#Overview)\n\nThis sample code project demonstrates how to create and display 2D shapes in your visionOS app, using SwiftUI views that adopt the [`Shape`](\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Shape) protocol, including your custom types.\n\nThe following image shows the main view of the app, which draws four shapes:\n\n- A circle\n\n- A rectangle\n\n- A triangle\n\n- A dashed line\n\nSwiftUI defines the `Circle` and `Rectangle` types, and the sample defines the custom types `Triangle` and `Line`.\n\n### [Add existing shapes from SwiftUI to a view](\/documentation\/visionos\/creating-2d-shapes-in-visionos-with-swiftui#Add-existing-shapes-from-SwiftUI-to-a-view)\n\nThe app’s main view draws the outline of a circle and a rectangle by adding an instance of [`Circle`](\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Circle) and [`Rectangle`](\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Rectangle), respectively.\n\n\n\n```\nstruct ShapesView: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        \/\/\/ The gap between each shape.\n        let spaceBetweenShapes: CGFloat = 30.0\n\n\n        \/\/\/ The width and height for the frame of each shape view.\n        let shapeScale: CGFloat = 100.0\n\n\n        \/\/\/ A width for all the lines in each shape.\n        let strokeWidth: CGFloat = 5.0\n\n\n        \/\/ ...\n\n\n        HStack(spacing: spaceBetweenShapes) {\n            Circle()\n                .stroke(lineWidth: strokeWidth)\n                .frame(width: shapeScale, height: shapeScale)\n            Rectangle()\n                .stroke(lineWidth: strokeWidth)\n                .frame(width: shapeScale, height: shapeScale)\n                \n            \/\/ ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe [`stroke(_:lineWidth:)`](\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Shape\/stroke(_:lineWidth:)) method sets the thickness of the line that the shape uses to draw itself, and the [`frame(width:height:alignment:)`](\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/frame(width:height:alignment:)) method puts the shape inside an invisible view.\n\n### [Create custom shape types](\/documentation\/visionos\/creating-2d-shapes-in-visionos-with-swiftui#Create-custom-shape-types)\n\nThis sample defines custom shape types for lines and triangles that draw themselves by adopting the [`Shape`](\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Shape) protocol and implementing a custom [`Path`](\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Path) method.\n\nThe `Line` type stores two endpoints and draws a line between them in its `path(in:)` method.\n\n\n\n```\nimport SwiftUI\n\n\nstruct Line: Shape {\n    let endPoint1: CGPoint\n    let endPoint2: CGPoint\n\n\n    \/\/ ...\n    \n    func path(in bounds: CGRect) -> Path {\n        \/\/\/ The drawing path for the triangle shape.\n        var path = Path()\n        \n        \/\/ Draw the line between the two endpoints.\n        path.move(to: endPoint1)\n        path.addLine(to: endPoint2)\n\n\n        return path\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe `Triangle` type stores three vertices for a triangle and draws a line between each vertex in its custom `path(in:)` method.\n\n\n\n```\nimport SwiftUI\n\n\nstruct Triangle: Shape {\n    let vertex1: CGPoint\n    let vertex2: CGPoint\n    let vertex3: CGPoint\n\n\n    \/\/ ...\n    \n    func path(in bounds: CGRect) -> Path {\n        \/\/\/ The drawing path for the triangle shape.\n        var path = Path()\n\n\n        \/\/ Start at the first vertex.\n        path.move(to: vertex1)\n\n\n        \/\/ Draw the triangle's first two sides.\n        path.addLine(to: vertex2)\n        path.addLine(to: vertex3)\n        \n        \/\/ Draw the triangle's third side by returning to the first vertex.\n        path.closeSubpath()\n\n\n        return path\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe shapes view adds a triangle by creating three [`CGPoint`](\/documentation\/CoreFoundation\/CGPoint) instances and passing them to the `Triangle` initializer.\n\n\n\n```\nstruct ShapesView: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        \/\/\/ The gap between each shape.\n        let spaceBetweenShapes: CGFloat = 30.0\n\n\n        \/\/\/ The width and height for the frame of each shape view.\n        let shapeScale: CGFloat = 100.0\n\n\n        \/\/\/ A width for all the lines in each shape.\n        let strokeWidth: CGFloat = 5.0\n\n\n        \/\/\/ The upper-leading corner of the triangle.\n        let vertex1 = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: 0.0)\n\n\n        \/\/\/ The lower-trailing corner of the triangle.\n        let vertex2 = CGPoint(x: shapeScale, y: shapeScale)\n\n\n        \/\/\/ The lower-leading corner of the triangle.\n        let vertex3 = CGPoint(x: 0.0, y: shapeScale)\n\n\n        \/\/ ...\n\n\n        HStack(spacing: spaceBetweenShapes) {\n            \/\/ ...\n            \n            Triangle(vertex1, vertex2, vertex3)\n                .stroke(lineWidth: strokeWidth)\n                .frame(width: shapeScale, height: shapeScale)\n         \n            \/\/ ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nEach vertex uses SwiftUI coordinates. The origin of this coordinate system is in the upper-left corner, and the y-axis increases in a downward direction.\n\n### [Add customizations to shape types](\/documentation\/visionos\/creating-2d-shapes-in-visionos-with-swiftui#Add-customizations-to-shape-types)\n\nTo draw a line with dashes, add a `dashed(_:)` method to the `Line` type, which the sample puts in an extension.\n\n\n\n```\nextension Line {\n    func dashed(_ width: CGFloat,\n                _ dashPattern: [CGFloat]? = nil) -> some Shape {\n        let pattern = dashPattern ?? [width]\n        let style = StrokeStyle(lineWidth: width, dash: pattern)\n\n\n        return stroke(style: style)\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe method creates an instance of a line, applying a stroke style to it.\n\nThe shapes view calls this method to create a dashed line based on the stroke width for all the shapes in the view.\n\n\n\n```\n        \/\/\/ The gap between each shape.\n        let spaceBetweenShapes: CGFloat = 30.0\n\n\n        \/\/\/ The width and height for the frame of each shape view.\n        let shapeScale: CGFloat = 100.0\n\n\n        \/\/\/ A width for all the lines in each shape.\n        let strokeWidth: CGFloat = 5.0\n\n\n        \/\/ ...\n\n\n        \/\/\/ A pattern for the dashed line.\n        let strokePattern = [3 * strokeWidth, 2 * strokeWidth]\n\n\n        HStack(spacing: spaceBetweenShapes) {\n            \/\/ ...\n            \n            Line(shapeScale)\n                .dashed(strokeWidth, strokePattern)\n                .frame(width: shapeScale, height: shapeScale)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this sample, the view draws each line segment one-and-a-half times longer than the gaps between adjacent line segments.\n\n## [See Also](\/documentation\/visionos\/creating-2d-shapes-in-visionos-with-swiftui#See-Also)\n\n#### [Related samples](\/documentation\/visionos\/creating-2d-shapes-in-visionos-with-swiftui#Related-samples)\n\n[Creating 3D entities with RealityKit](\/documentation\/visionos\/creating-3d-entities-with-realitykit)Display a horizontal row of three-dimensional shapes in your visionOS app, using predefined mesh and white material.",
