  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf you’re new to visionOS, start with a new Xcode project to learn about the platform features, and to familiarize yourself with visionOS content and techniques. When you build an app for visionOS, SwiftUI is an excellent choice because it gives you full access to visionOS features. Although you can also use UIKit to build portions of your app, you need to use SwiftUI for many features that are unique to the platform.\n\nIn any SwiftUI app, you place content onscreen using scenes. A scene contains the views and controls to display onscreen. Scenes also define the appearance of those views and controls when they appear onscreen. In visionOS, you can include both 2D and 3D views in the same scene, and you can present those views in a window or as part of the person’s surroundings.\n\nStart with a new Xcode project and add features to familiarize yourself with visionOS content and techniques. Run your app in Simulator to verify your content looks like you expect, and run it on device to see your 3D content come to life.\n\nOrganize your content around one or more scenes, which manage your app’s interface. Each scene contains the views and controls you want to display, and the scene type determines whether your content adopts a 2D or 3D appearance. SwiftUI adds 3D scene types specifically for visionOS, and also adds 3D elements and layout options for all scene types.\n\n### Create your Xcode project\n\nCreate a new project in Xcode by choosing File > New > Project. Navigate to the visionOS section of the template chooser, and choose the App template. When prompted, specify a name for your project along with other options.\n\nWhen creating a new visionOS app, you can configure your app’s initial scene types from the configuration dialog. To display primarily 2D content in your initial scene, choose a Window as your initial scene type. For primarily 3D content, choose a Volume. You can also add an immersive scene to place your content in the person’s surroundings.\n\n\n\nInclude a Reality Composer Pro project file when you want to create 3D assets or scenes to display from your app. Use this project file to build content from primitive shapes and existing USDZ assets. You can also use it to build and test custom RealityKit animations and behaviors for your content.\n\n### Modify the existing window\n\nBuild your initial interface using standard SwiftUI views. Views provide the basic content for your interface, and you customize the appearance and behavior of them using SwiftUI modifiers. For example, the `.background` modifier adds a partially transparent tint color behind your content:\n\nTo learn more about how to create and configure interfaces using SwiftUI, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/tutorials\/swiftui].\n\n### Handle events in your views\n\nMany SwiftUI views handle interactions automatically — all you do is provide code to run when the interactions occur. You can also add SwiftUI gesture recognizers to a view to handle tap, long-press, drag, rotate, and zoom gestures. The system automatically maps the following types of input to your SwiftUI event-handling code:\n\nFor more information about handling interactions in SwiftUI views, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/tutorials\/swiftui\/handling-user-input] in the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/tutorials\/swiftui] tutorial.\n\n### Build and run your app\n\nBuild and run your app in Simulator to see how it looks. Simulator for visionOS has a virtual background as the backdrop for your app’s content. Use your keyboard and your mouse or trackpad to navigate around the environment and interact with your app.\n\nTap and drag the window bar below your app’s content to reposition the window in the environment. Move the pointer over the circle next to the window bar to reveal the window’s close button. Move the cursor to one of the window’s corners to turn the window bar into a resizing control.\n\nFor additional information about how to interact with your app in Simulator, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/interacting-with-your-app-in-the-visionos-simulator].",
