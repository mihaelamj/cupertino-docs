  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA fully immersive experience replaces everything the person sees with custom content you create. You might use this type of experience to:\n\nWith a fully immersive experience, you’re responsible for everything that appears onscreen. The system hides passthrough video and displays the content you provide, showing the person’s hands only when they come into view. To achieve the best performance, use RealityKit or Metal to create and animate your content.\n\nTypically, you combine a fully immersive experience with other types of experiences and provide transitions between them. When you display a window first and then offer controls to enter your immersive experience, you give people time to prepare for the transition. It also gives them the option to skip the experience if they prefer to use your app’s windows instead.\n\n### Prepare someone for your app’s transitions\n\nGive people control over when they enter or exit fully immersive experiences, and provide clear transitions to and from those experiences. Clear visual transitions make it easier to adjust to such a large change. Sudden transitions might be disorienting, unpleasant, or make the person think something went wrong.\n\nAt launch time, display windows or other content that allows the person to see their surroundings. Add controls to that content to initiate the transition to the fully immersive experience, and provide a clear indication of what the controls do. Inside your experience, provide clear controls and instructions on how to exit the experience.\n\nFor guidelines on how to design fully immersive experiences, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/human-interface-guidelines].\n\n### Open an immersive space\n\nTo create a fully immersive experience, open an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ImmersiveSpace] and set its style to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ImmersionStyle\/full]. An immersive space is a type of SwiftUI scene that lets you place content anywhere in the person’s surroundings. Applying the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ImmersionStyle\/full] style to the scene tells the system to hide passthrough video and display only your app’s content.\n\nDeclare spaces in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/App\/body-swift.property] property of your app object, or anywhere you manage SwiftUI scenes. The following example shows an app with a main window and a fully immersive space. At launch time, the app displays the window.\n\nTo display an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ImmersiveSpace], open it using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/openImmersiveSpace] action, which you obtain from the SwiftUI environment. This action runs asynchronously and uses the provided information to find and initialize your scene. The following example shows a button that opens the space with the `solarSystem` identifier:\n\nAn app can display only one space at a time, and it’s an error for you to try to open a space while another space is visible. To dismiss an open space, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/EnvironmentValues\/dismissImmersiveSpace] action.\n\nFor more information about displaying spaces, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/ImmersiveSpace] type.\n\n### Draw your content using RealityKit\n\nRealityKit works well when your content consists of primitive shapes or existing content in USD files. Organize the contents of your scene using RealityKit entities, and animate that content using components and systems. Use Reality Composer Pro to assemble your content visually, and to attach dynamic shaders, animations, audio, and other behaviors to your content. Display the contents of your RealityKit scene in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/RealityKit\/RealityView] in your scene.\n\nTo load a Reality Composer Pro scene at runtime, fetch the URL of your Reality Composer Pro package file, and load the root entity of your scene. The following example shows how to create the entity for a package located in the app’s bundle:\n\nFor more information about how to display content in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/RealityKit\/RealityView] and manage interactions with your content, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.visionOS\/documentation\/visionOS\/adding-3d-content-to-your-app].\n\n### Draw your content using Metal\n\nAnother option for creating fully immersive scenes is to draw everything yourself using Metal. When using Metal to draw your content, use the Compositor Services framework to place that content onscreen. Compositor Services provides the code you need to set up your Metal rendering engine and start drawing.\n\nFor details on how to render content using Metal and Compositor Services, and manage interactions with your content, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CompositorServices\/drawing-fully-immersive-content-using-metal].",
