The text-based on-device model identifies patterns that allow for generating new text that’s appropriate for the request you make, and it can make decisions to call code you write to perform specialized tasks.\n\nGenerate text content based on requests you make. The on-device model excels at a diverse range of text generation tasks, like summarization, entity extraction, text understanding, refinement, dialog for games, generating creative content, and more.\n\nGenerate entire Swift data structures with guided generation. With the `@Generable` macro, you can define custom data structures and the framework provides strong guarantees that the model generates instances of your type.\n\nTo expand what the on-device foundation model can do, use [`Tool`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/tool) to create custom tools that the model can call to assist with handling your request. For example, the model can call a tool that searches a local or online database for information, or calls a service in your app.\n\nTo use the on-device language model, people need to turn on Apple Intelligence on their device. For a list of supported devices, see [Apple Intelligence](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-intelligence\/).\n\nFor more information about acceptable usage of the Foundation Models framework, see [Acceptable use requirements for the Foundation Models framework](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/apple-intelligence\/acceptable-use-requirements-for-the-foundation-models-framework).\n\n### [Related videos](\/documentation\/foundationmodels#Related-videos)\n\n[ Meet the Foundation Models framework ](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/286)[ Deep dive into the Foundation Models framework ](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/301)[ Code-along: Bring on-device AI to your app using the Foundation Models framework ](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2025\/259)## [Topics](\/documentation\/foundationmodels#topics)\n\n### [Essentials](\/documentation\/foundationmodels#Essentials)\n\n[Generating content and performing tasks with Foundation Models](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/generating-content-and-performing-tasks-with-foundation-models)Enhance the experience in your app by prompting an on-device large language model.[Improving the safety of generative model output](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/improving-the-safety-of-generative-model-output)Create generative experiences that appropriately handle sensitive inputs and respect people.[Supporting languages and locales with Foundation Models](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/supporting-languages-and-locales-with-foundation-models)Generate content in the language people prefer when they interact with your app.[Adding intelligent app features with generative models](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/adding-intelligent-app-features-with-generative-models)Build robust apps with guided generation and tool calling by adopting the Foundation Models framework.[`class SystemLanguageModel`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/systemlanguagemodel)An on-device large language model capable of text generation tasks.[`struct UseCase`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/systemlanguagemodel\/usecase)A type that represents the use case for prompting.### [Prompting](\/documentation\/foundationmodels#Prompting)\n\n[Prompting an on-device foundation model](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/prompting-an-on-device-foundation-model)Tailor your prompts to get effective results from an on-device model.[`class LanguageModelSession`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/languagemodelsession)An object that represents a session that interacts with a language model.[`struct Instructions`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/instructions)Details you provide that define the model’s intended behavior on prompts.[`struct Prompt`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/prompt)A prompt from a person to the model.[`struct Transcript`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/transcript)A linear history of entries that reflect an interaction with a session.[`struct GenerationOptions`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/generationoptions)Options that control how the model generates its response to a prompt.### [Guided generation](\/documentation\/foundationmodels#Guided-generation)\n\n[Generating Swift data structures with guided generation](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/generating-swift-data-structures-with-guided-generation)Create robust apps by describing output you want programmatically.[`protocol Generable`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/generable)A type that the model uses when responding to prompts.### [Tool calling](\/documentation\/foundationmodels#Tool-calling)\n\n[Expanding generation with tool calling](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/expanding-generation-with-tool-calling)Build tools that enable the model to perform tasks that are specific to your use case.[Generate dynamic game content with guided generation and tools](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/generate-dynamic-game-content-with-guided-generation-and-tools)Make gameplay more lively with AI generated dialog and encounters personalized to the player.[`protocol Tool`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/tool)A tool that a model can call to gather information at runtime or perform side effects.### [Feedback](\/documentation\/foundationmodels#Feedback)\n\n[`struct LanguageModelFeedback`](\/documentation\/foundationmodels\/languagemodelfeedback)Feedback appropriate for logging or attaching to Feedback Assistant.",
