  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse an adapter to adapt the on-device foundation model to fit your specific use case without needing to retrain the entire model from scratch. Before you can load a custom adapter, you first need to train one with an adapter training toolkit. The toolkit uses Python and Pytorch, and requires familiarity with training machine-learning models. After you train an adapter, you can use the toolkit to export a package in the format that Xcode and the Foundation Models framework expects.\n\nWhen you train an adapter you need to make it available for deployment into your app. An adapter file is large — 160 MB or more — so don’t bundle them in your app. Instead, use App Store Connect, or host the asset on your server, and download the correct adapter for a person’s device on-demand.\n\nFor more information about the adapter training toolkit, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/apple-intelligence\/foundation-models-adapter\/]. For more information about asset packs, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets].\n\n## Test a local adapter in Xcode\n\nAfter you train an adapter with the adapter training toolkit, store your `.fmadapter` package files in a different directory from your app. Then, open `.fmadapter` packages with Xcode to locally preview each adapter’s metadata and version compatibility before you deploy the adapter.\n\nIf you train multiple adapters:\n\nAfter you initialize an `Adapter`, create an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundationmodels\/documentation\/FoundationModels\/SystemLanguageModel] with it:\n\nTesting adapters requires a physical device and isn’t supported on Simulator. When you’re ready to deploy adapters in your app, you need the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.foundation-model-adapter] entitlement. You don’t need this entitlement to train or locally test adapters. To request access to use the entitlement, log in to Apple Developer and see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/contact\/request\/foundation-models-framework-adapter-entitlement].\n\n## Bundle adapters as asset packs\n\nWhen people use your app they only need the specific adapter that’s compatible with their device. Host your adapter assets on a server and use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets] to manage downloads. For hosting, you can use your own server or have Apple host your adapter assets. For more information about Apple-hosted asset packs, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-asset-packs\/overview-of-apple-hosted-asset-packs\/].\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets] framework has a type of asset pack specific to adapters that you create for the Foundation Models framework. The Foundation Models adapter training toolkit helps you bundle your adapters in the correct asset pack format. The toolkit uses the `ba-package` command line tool that’s included with Xcode 16 or later. If you train your adapters on a Linux GPU machine, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/apple-intelligence\/foundation-models-adapter\/#how-to-train-adapters] to set up a Python environment on your Mac. The adapter toolkit includes example code that shows how to create the asset pack in the correct format.\n\nAfter you generate an asset pack for each adapter, upload the asset packs to your server. For more information about uploading Apple-hosted adapters, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-asset-packs\/upload-apple-hosted-asset-packs].\n\n## Configure an asset-download target in Xcode\n\nTo download adapters at runtime, you need to add an asset-downloader extension target to your Xcode project:\n\nThe type of extension depends on whether you self-host them or Apple hosts them:\n\nAfter you create an asset-downloader extension target, check that your app target’s info property list contains the required fields specific to your extension type:\n\nIf you use *Self-Hosted, Unmanaged*, then you don’t need additional keys. For more information about configuring background assets with an extension, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/configuring-an-unmanaged-background-assets-project]\n\n## Choose a compatible adapter at runtime\n\nWhen you create an asset-downloader extension, Xcode generates a Swift file — `BackgroundDownloadHandler.swift` — that [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets] uses to download your adapters. Open the Swift file in Xcode and fill in the code based on your target type. For *Apple-Hosted, Managed* or *Self-Hosted, Managed* extension types, complete the function `shouldDownload` with the following code that chooses an adapter asset compatible with the runtime device:\n\nIf your extension type is *Self-Hosted, Unmanaged*, the file Xcode generates has many functions in it for manual control over the download life cycle of your assets.\n\n## Load adapter assets in your app\n\nAfter you configure an asset-downloader extension, you can start loading adapters. Before you download an adapter, remove any outdated adapters that might be on a person’s device:\n\nCreate an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundationmodels\/documentation\/FoundationModels\/SystemLanguageModel\/Adapter] using your adapter’s base name, but exclude the file extension. If a person’s device doesn’t have a compatible adapter downloaded, your asset-downloader extension starts downloading a compatible adapter asset pack:\n\nInitializing a [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundationmodels\/documentation\/FoundationModels\/SystemLanguageModel\/Adapter] starts a download automatically when a person launches your app for the first time or their device needs an updated adapter. Because adapters can have a large data size they can take some time to download, especially if a person is on Wi-Fi or a cell network. If a person doesn’t have a network connection, they aren’t able to use your adapter right away. This method shows how to track the download status of an adapter:\n\nFor more details on tracking downloads for general assets, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/downloading-apple-hosted-asset-packs].\n\nBefore you attempt to use the adapter, you need to wait for the status to be in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/AssetPackManager\/DownloadStatusUpdate\/finished(_:)] state. The system returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/AssetPackManager\/DownloadStatusUpdate\/finished(_:)] immediately if no download is necessary.\n\n## Compile your draft model\n\nA draft model is an optional step when training your adapter that can speed up inference. If your adapter includes a draft model, you can compile it for faster inference:\n\nFor more about training draft models, see the “Optionally train the draft model” section in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/apple-intelligence\/foundation-models-adapter\/].\n\nCompiling a draft model is a computationally expensive step, so use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks] framework to configure a background task for your app. In your background task, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.foundationmodels\/documentation\/FoundationModels\/SystemLanguageModel\/Adapter\/compile()] on your adapter to start compilation. For more information about using background tasks, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/using-background-tasks-to-update-your-app].\n\nCompilation doesn’t run every time a person uses your app:\n\nThe full compilation process runs every time you launch your app through Xcode because Xcode assigns your app a new UUID for every launch. If you receive a rate-limiting error while testing your app, stop your app in Xcode and re-launch it to reset the rate counter.",
