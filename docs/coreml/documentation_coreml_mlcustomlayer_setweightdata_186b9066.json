Your implementation should validate the weights and throw an error if the weights do not have the expected shape or values.\n\nThe data encoded in the `weights` field of the `.mlmodel` file is loaded and passed into this method. If there are repeated weights in the `.mlmodel` file, they will be listed explicitly in the `weights` array. The weight values are provided in the order that they were defined during the custom layer conversion process. Keep a reference to the `weights` passed in because copying the `weights` array can significantly increase an app’s memory. Avoid modifying values of the weights.",
