Each element represents the size of the shaped array’s corresponding dimension.\n- **initializer**: A closure you provide that initializes the shaped array’s underlying memory. The initializer calls your closure with a pointer to the memory and an array of strides that correspond to the shaped array’s dimensions.\n\n",
