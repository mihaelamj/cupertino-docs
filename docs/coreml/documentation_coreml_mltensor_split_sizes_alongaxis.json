The tensor is split  into `sizes.shape[0]` parts.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nfunc split(sizes: [Int], alongAxis axis: Int = 0) -> [MLTensor]\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **sizes**: A one-dimensional tensor containing the size of each split, must add up to the size of dimension `axis`.\n- **axis**: The dimension along which to split this tensor. Must be in the range `[-rank, rank)`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nArray containing the tensors parts.\n\n## Discussion\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\/\/ 'value' is a tensor with shape [5, 30]\n\/\/ Split 'value' into 3 tensors with sizes [4, 15, 11] along dimension 1:\nlet parts = value.split(sizes: [4, 15, 11], alongAxis: 1)\nparts[0] \/\/ has shape [5, 4]\nparts[1] \/\/ has shape [5, 15]\nparts[2] \/\/ has shape [5, 11]\n```\n\n## Splitting the tensor\n\n- **split(count:alongAxis:)**: Splits a tensor into multiple tensors. The tensor is split along dimension `axis` into `count` smaller tensors.\n\n",
