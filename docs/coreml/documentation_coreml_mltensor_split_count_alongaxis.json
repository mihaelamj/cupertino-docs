The tensor is split along dimension `axis` into `count` smaller tensors.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nfunc split(count: Int, alongAxis axis: Int = 0) -> [MLTensor]\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **count**: The number of splits to create, must divide the size of dimension `axis` evenly.\n- **axis**: The dimension along which to split this tensor. The `axis` must be in the range `[-rank, rank)`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn array containing the tensor parts.\n\n## Discussion\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n\/\/ 'value' is a tensor with shape [5, 30]\n\/\/ Split 'value' into 3 tensors along dimension 1:\nlet parts = value.split(count: 3, alongAxis: 1)\nparts[0] \/\/ has shape [5, 10]\nparts[1] \/\/ has shape [5, 10]\nparts[2] \/\/ has shape [5, 10]\n```\n\n## Splitting the tensor\n\n- **split(sizes:alongAxis:)**: Splits a tensor into multiple tensors. The tensor is split  into `sizes.shape[0]` parts.\n\n",
