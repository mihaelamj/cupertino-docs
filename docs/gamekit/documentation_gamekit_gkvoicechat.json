It’s your responsibility to provide player controls and display feedback during the chat.\n\nFirst, configure voice chat by adding the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSMicrophoneUsageDescription] key to the Information Property List and creating an audio session. Then, create a `GKVoiceChat` object using the `GKMatch` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatch\/voiceChat(withName:)] method passing a string that identifies the voice channel. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKVoiceChat\/start()] method to connect players to the channel. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKVoiceChat\/isActive] property to activate the microphone or switch the microphone between channels.\n\nProvide a handler using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKVoiceChat\/playerVoiceChatStateDidChangeHandler] property to update the interface when a player connects, speaks, or disconnects from a chat. You can also add controls that mute and set the volume using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKVoiceChat\/setPlayer(_:muted:)] method and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKVoiceChat\/volume] property.\n\nNote that if there’s insufficient bandwidth over Wi-Fi to maintain a voice chat, GameKit may disconnect players from the channel or disband a channel.",
