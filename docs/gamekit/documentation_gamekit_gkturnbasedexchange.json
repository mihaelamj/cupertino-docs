The exchange object encapsulates your custom game data that you want to communicate to other players.\n\nYou initiate an exchange request using the `GKTurnBasedMatch` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch\/sendExchange(to:data:localizableMessageKey:arguments:timeout:completionHandler:)] method. Then GameKit sends the request to the recipients passing the exchange object to the `GKTurnBasedEventListener` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventListener\/player(_:receivedExchangeRequest:for:)] protocol method. GameKit sets the status of the exchange object to [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedExchangeStatus\/active].\n\nAfter all recipients respond to the request, using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedExchange\/reply(withLocalizableMessageKey:arguments:data:completionHandler:)] method, or exceed the time out specified in the request, GameKit sends the exchange to the sender and the current participant. GameKit sets the exchange status to [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedExchangeStatus\/complete] and then passes it to the `GKTurnBasedEventListener` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventListener\/player(_:receivedExchangeReplies:forCompletedExchange:for:)] method.\n\nBefore the current participant ends their turn, save the completed exchanges using the `GKTurnBasedMatch` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch\/saveMergedMatch(_:withResolvedExchanges:completionHandler:)] method.

Alternatively, save exchange data in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventListener\/player(_:receivedExchangeReplies:forCompletedExchange:for:)] protocol method when all recipients reply to specific exchange requests.\n\nTo cancel an active or complete exchange, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedExchange\/cancel(withLocalizableMessageKey:arguments:completionHandler:)] method. GameKit notifies the recipients when the player cancels an exchange, using the `GKTurnBasedEventListener` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventListener\/player(_:receivedExchangeCancellation:for:)] protocol method.",
