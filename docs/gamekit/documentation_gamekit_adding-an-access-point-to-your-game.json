  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYou can add an *access point* to your game that provides a way for players to manage their profile, and view leaderboards, achievements, and challenges.\n\nThe access point initially shows player highlights, like how many achievements they’ve earned and where they stand in leaderboards. Then the access point collapses into the player’s avatar and remains on your game’s screen. When the player taps or clicks the avatar, GameKit displays the dashboard so players can drill down into the details of their Game Center data, including more highlights and statistics. You can choose where to display the access point, and select the highlights to display.\n\n\n\nYou can also display the dashboard on its own, or a particular section of the dashboard. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/displaying-the-game-center-dashboard]. For design guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/game-center#Access-point].\n\n### Configure the access point\n\nYou can place the access point in a corner of the screen and choose whether to show highlights when the access point first appears, such as the number of achievements or the player’s rank on the default leaderboard. Start by obtaining the shared [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint] object using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/shared] class property.\n\nIf you don’t want the access point to appear on the main window, set it to another window using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/parentWindow] property. For example, set the parent window to your title screen or main menu. For volumetric games on visionOS, you need to set the parent window for the access point to appear. For immersive games on visionOS, it appears below the HUD and in front of the person by default.\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/location-swift.property] property to set the corner in which the access point appears. The default location is the upper-left corner ([doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/Location-swift.enum\/topLeading]). For volumetric and immersive games on visionOS, if you don’t set the parent window, GameKit ignores the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/location-swift.property] property (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/adding-an-access-point-to-your-game#Configure-the-access-point-on-visionOS]).\n\nFor right-to-left languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew, the system flips the location. For example, [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/Location-swift.enum\/topLeading] specifies the upper-right corner and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/Location-swift.enum\/bottomLeading] specifies the bottom-left corner.\n\nTo display highlights when the access point appears, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/showHighlights] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true]:\n\nWhen you’re done configuring the access point, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/isActive] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true]:\n\nHide the access point when displaying game intros or settings. To give your players a consistent experience, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/game-center\/overview\/access-point\/] in the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/].\n\n### Adapt your game to the access point\n\nYou can observe access point properties to adjust your game when the access point either changes sizes or just before it presents the dashboard.\n\n\n\nTo adjust your graphics when the access point size changes (for example, while it displays highlights), observe the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/frameInScreenCoordinates] property. Be sure to convert the screen coordinates of the access point to your view’s coordinates.\n\nTo make changes to your game before the player interacts with the dashboard, observe the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/isPresentingGameCenter] property. For example, you should pause animations when the player clicks or taps the access point to display the dashboard.\n\n### Change the focus and display the dashboard programmatically\n\nIf you handle the input from an Apple TV remote and game controller yourself, you need to programmatically change the focus to the access point and display the dashboard when the player taps or clicks it.\n\nYou can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/frameInScreenCoordinates] property to change the focus when the player navigates the area behind the access point:\n\nThen use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/trigger(state:handler:)] method to show the dashboard when the player selects the access point.\n\n### Configure the access point on visionOS\n\nThe location of the access point and dashboard varies depending on the type of visionOS game. To change the default behavior below, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/location-swift.property] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/parentWindow] properties before you set [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAccessPoint\/isActive] to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true]. For example, if you don’t set the parent window of volumetric games, the access point doesn’t appear.\n\nFor all types of visionOS games, when the person displays the dashboard using the access point, it appears in a separate floating container app that the person can position in the space. However, if you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKGameCenterViewController] class to present the dashboard (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/displaying-the-game-center-dashboard]), it appears anchored to the window, scene, or view relative to where you present the view controller.",
