You can create multiple sessions for a single app, allowing players to play several games at once. All of the information for a game session is saved in the owner’s iCloud.\n\nEach session can contain a maximum of 100 players. Inside of a session, up to 16 of those players can be connected to each other in real-time. The 16 connected players can be selected from any of the 100 players in the session. You can change a connected player with another player in the session at any time.\n\nAfter a game session is created, you can save game data in iCloud. Each game session can save a maximum of 512KB data. This prevents games from using a large about of space in a user’s iCloud account. This data can be loaded, edited, and saved by anyone in the game session, providing your app provides this behavior. You must ensure that you delete a game session from a user’s iCloud after a game is over, otherwise the session will stay in the user’s iCloud forever. Game sessions are not automatically removed after a set amount of time. They can only be actively removed.",
