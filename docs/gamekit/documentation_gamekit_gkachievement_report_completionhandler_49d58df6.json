An achievement object is implicitly tied to the local player that was initialized when the object was created; your game should only report progress when the same local player is still on the device.\n\nWhen the progress is successfully reported, the achievement is made visible if it was previously hidden. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/percentComplete] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/lastReportedDate] property values stored on Game Center are updated if the new [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/percentComplete] value is greater than the value previously stored on Game Center. if the value of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/percentComplete] property was equal to `100.0`, then the achievement is marked as completed and a banner may be shown to the player.\n\nWhen this method is called, it creates a new background task to handle the request. The method then returns control to your game. The background task automatically handles network errors, resending the data until the task completes. When the task is complete, Game Kit calls your completion handler. The completion handler is always called on the main thread.",
