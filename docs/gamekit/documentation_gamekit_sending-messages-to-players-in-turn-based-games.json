  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nGameKit provides several APIs for you to communicate events and send messages in your turn-based games. You can include a message and custom game data in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch] object passed between active participants. You can also send a notification to other participants when they’re not running your game.\n\nTo send other types of data between players when they’re not taking their turn, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedExchange] class.\n\n### Pass messages from the current participant\n\nYou can send localized or non-localized messages from the current participant to others in a turn-based match using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch] object. If the game isn’t running or is in the background, the message you provide appears immediately at the top of the screen as a notification. If the game is in the foreground, get the message from the match object GameKit passes to participants and display it in your own interface.\n\nBefore you perform an action such as ending a turn, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch\/message] property of the match object. Alternatively, set a message that GameKit localizes using the receiving participant’s language and region settings using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch\/setLocalizableMessageWithKey(_:arguments:)] method.\n\nIf a participant taps the notification when it appears, GameKit launches the game or brings it to the foreground. GameKit invokes the `GKTurnBasedEventListener` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventListener\/player(_:receivedTurnEventFor:didBecomeActive:)] protocol method passing [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] as the active parameter. Implement this method to join the match. For more information on handling turn-based events, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/starting-turn-based-matches-and-passing-turns-between-players].\n\nIf the game is in the foreground, GameKit invokes this method but passes [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] as the active parameter. You can then present the message in your own interface by getting the message from the match object using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch\/message] property.\n\nTo localize a message, add the key you pass to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch\/setLocalizableMessageWithKey(_:arguments:)] method and a placeholder translation to a `.strings` file in your project (for example, the default `Localizable.strings` file). For more information on adapting your game for different languages and regions, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/localization].\n\n### Send messages from any participant\n\nSend a localized message from any participant to others using a Game Center notification. For example, send a reminder to the current participant from another participant who is waiting for them to take their turn. GameKit sends the reminder to the participants as a push notification that doesn’t interrupt their gameplay. The notification only appears when the game isn’t running — it doesn’t appear if the participant runs the game in either the foreground or background.\n\n\n\nTo display the GameKit notification:\n\nWhen the player taps the notification, GameKit invokes the `GKTurnBasedEventListener` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventListener\/player(_:receivedTurnEventFor:didBecomeActive:)] protocol method passing [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] as the active parameter. Implement this method to join the existing match.

The notification only appears when the game isn’t running — it doesn’t appear if the participant runs the game in either the foreground or background.\n\n\n\nTo display the GameKit notification:\n\n1. Invoke the `GKTurnBasedMatch` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch\/sendReminder(to:localizableMessageKey:arguments:completionHandler:)] method passing the participants and a localized message key:\n\n```swift\n\/\/ Create an array that contains the current participant.\nlet participants = match.participants.filter {\n    $0 == match.currentParticipant\n}\n\n\/\/ Send a reminder to the current participant.\ntry await match.sendReminder(to: participants, localizableMessageKey: \"It's your turn to play.\", arguments: [])\n```\n\n1. Add the localized message key and placeholder translation to a  `.strings` file in your project. If necessary, add a `.strings` file (for example, the default `Localizable.strings` file) to your project and make it localizable. For the Xcode steps, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-resources-to-localizations] and `Editing XLIFF and strings files`.\n\n```swift\n\"It's your turn to play.\" = \"It's your turn to play.\";\n```\n\nWhen the player taps the notification, GameKit invokes the `GKTurnBasedEventListener` [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventListener\/player(_:receivedTurnEventFor:didBecomeActive:)] protocol method passing [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] as the active parameter.
