Instead, GameKit passes a match object to a [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmakerViewControllerDelegate] method or a [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker] handler when you set up a multiplayer game. For details, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/finding-multiple-players-for-a-game].\n\nIf you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmakerViewController] class to find players, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmakerViewControllerDelegate\/matchmakerViewController(_:didFind:)] delegate method to set the match delegate. If you use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker] class, set the match delegate in the handler you pass to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/findMatch(for:withCompletionHandler:)] method.\n\nYou can begin exchanging data when two or more players join the match. Implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchDelegate\/match(_:player:didChange:)-8ohgr] delegate method to track when players connect or disconnect from the match. Then use either the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatch\/sendData(toAllPlayers:with:)] or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatch\/send(_:to:dataMode:)] method to send data. To process the data on the recipient side, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchDelegate\/match(_:didReceive:fromRemotePlayer:)] delegate method.\n\nTo implement voice chat, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatch\/voiceChat(withName:)] method to create one or more voice channels represented by the returned [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKVoiceChat] object.\n\nWhen you’re finished with a match, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatch\/disconnect()] method and set the match’s delegate to `nil`. Otherwise, GameKit may send [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchDelegate\/match(_:player:didChange:)-8ohgr] to the delegate until all players disconnect from the match.",
