If the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKGameCenterViewController] class is available, you should use it instead.\n- **GKChallengeEventHandler**: The `GKChallengeEventHandler` class is used to respond to events related to challenges sent or received by the local player.\n- **GKChallengesViewController**\n- **GKChallenge**: A challenge issued by the local player to another player.\n- **GKScoreChallenge**: A type of challenge where a player must beat the leaderboard score of another player.\n- **GKAchievementChallenge**: A type of challenge where a player must earn another player’s achievement.\n- **GKCloudPlayer**: The object representing the currently signed-in iCloud user.\n- **GKGameCenterViewController**: The dashboard that allows players to access their Game Center data in your game.\n- **GKGameSession**: A game session you can use to save game data, invite other players, and create turn-based and real-time game apps.\n- **GKGameSessionSharingViewController**: A user interface you can use to invite other users into a tvOS game session.\n- **GKFriendRequestComposeViewController**: Your game uses the `GKFriendRequestComposeViewController` class to present a screen that allows the local player to send friend requests to other players.\n- **GKLeaderboardViewController**: The `GKLeaderboardViewController` class provides a standard user interface that displays leaderboard scores to the player. If the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKGameCenterViewController] class is available, you should use it instead.\n- **GKScore**: An object containing information for a score that was earned by the player.\n- **GKSession**: A [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKSession] object provides the ability to discover and connect to nearby iOS devices using Bluetooth or Wi-fi.\n- **GKTurnBasedEventHandler**: The [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventHandler] class is used to respond to important messages related to turn-based matches. To use it, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventHandler\/shared()] class method to get the singleton instance and assign an object that implements the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventHandlerDelegate] protocol to its [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventHandler\/delegate] property.
