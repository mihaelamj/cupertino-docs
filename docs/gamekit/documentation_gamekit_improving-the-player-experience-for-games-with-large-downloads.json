  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAs games become larger and more visually impressive, it’s important to balance initial download time with a smooth gameplay experience and responsible disk usage. Providing a small base installation that merely begins another installation phase doesn’t make for a great experience when players are excited to play your game. Instead, provide enough content in your initial download that a player can evaluate your game, and keep your initial download to under 30 minutes. Apple provides two technologies that your game can use to provide the right amount of content in your base installation and help you download additional content in the background: on-demand resources and the Background Assets framework.\n\n### Maximize your app bundle’s size\n\nIf your game targets iOS 18, iPadOS 18, or any version of tvOS, your game’s app bundle can be up to 4 GB in size, as outlined in the table below. You need to deliver any additional content through on-demand resources, the Background Assets framework, or your own in-game solution.\n\n### Include additional content in your game’s base installation\n\nWith on-demand resources, you can specify additional content to download from the App Store while your game installs. Alternatively, you can use the Background Assets framework to write an extension that downloads content from your own website or CDN. With either solution, the player sees a single progress indicator while the system downloads your game’s app bundle and any additional first-launch content. A purely in-app solution can’t include additional content in the base installation.\n\n### Apply tags to use on-demand resources\n\nOn-demand resources are assets hosted by Apple. To use them, split your game’s content into asset packs, apply one or more tags to each pack, and submit your asset packs to the App Store along with your game. For more information on applying tags to your assets, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/FileManagement\/Conceptual\/On_Demand_Resources_Guide\/Tagging.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40015083-CH3-SW1].\n\n### Identify which tags apply to essential and early-game content\n\nAfter you assign tags to your asset packs, use the Prefetch view to identify which tags you should include in your game’s base installation. Asset packs matching these tags are included in the base installation progress and are available when your game first launches. You can also specify an additional set of tags to automatically download after the base installation completes. This prefetched content might not finish downloading before the user launches your game. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/FileManagement\/Conceptual\/On_Demand_Resources_Guide\/Tagging.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40015083-CH3-SW2].\n\n### Use the on-demand resources API for later-game and optional content\n\nYour game can programmatically download asset packs using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSBundleResourceRequest] API. This allows you to save disk space by only downloading content after the player unlocks it through progression or In-App Purchases. Because asset packs can have multiple tags, splitting your content into smaller asset packs can further reduce your game’s disk space usage. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSBundleResourceRequest] API to request tags, which prompt the system to download any matching asset packs as necessary.\n\nFor content unlocked by progress, requesting tags before they’re needed can make the content available to the player without waiting. In case the download doesn’t complete before the player needs the content, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSBundleResourceRequest\/progress] property to keep the user informed.\n\nWhen the player completes part of your game’s content, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle\/setPreservationPriority(_:forTags:)] method of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Bundle] class to inform the system that the asset packs containing that content are no longer necessary.\n\n### Stay within the on-demand resources limits\n\nIf your game targets iOS 18, iPadOS 18, or tvOS 18, it can have up to 70 GB of assets in up to 1,000 asset packs, an unlimited subset of which you can include in your initial install tags or prefetch tags. The table below shows the resource limits:\n\n### Use Background Assets for content outside the App Store\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets] framework if you want to host your game’s additional content outside the App Store. To use Background Assets, write a Background Assets extension that tells the system how to download assets from your website or CDN. Your extension can also react to authentication challenges and changes in download status. Your game uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/BADownloadManager] API to stay informed of completed downloads and schedule new downloads.\n\n### Add information about your essential content\n\nThe `BAEssentialDownloadAllowance` key tells the App Store how much additional content your Background Assets Extension downloads during installation. Your App Store listing includes this information in the displayed download size. The `BAEssentialMaxInstallSize` key tells the system how much space those assets require when uncompressed.\n\n### Extract your assets to the correct location\n\nThe system places downloaded files in a purgeable location. When the system finishes downloading your essential content, it informs your game if the user launched it immediately or it informs your extension. The process that receives the notification must extract the assets to a stable location where your game can find them. Choose a location within your game’s `Caches` directory. Don’t extract your assets to the `Documents` directory because this causes them to get included in device backups. To find the appropriate `Caches` directory, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager] API:\n\n### Redownload essential assets on failure\n\nIf an essential download fails, the system skips it, and installation of your app proceeds. Therefore, reschedule the asset as nonessential so that it begins downloading. The system delivers the failure notification to your game if it’s running or else to your extension.",
