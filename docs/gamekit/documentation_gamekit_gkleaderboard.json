  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nLeaderboards allow players to compare their scores against other players in your game. You configure a classic or recurring leaderboard in App Store Connect and then access the localized information for a leaderboard in your code using [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard] objects.\n\nA *classic leaderboard* is persistent, that is, the scores never reset unless you delete the leaderboard. A *recurring leaderboard* contains scores for a period of time useful for competitions and encouraging players to try for higher scores. You configure the duration, frequency, and delay between occurrences that Game Center uses to automatically restart the leaderboard in App Store Connect.\n\nIn your code, you use the identifier you set for the leaderboard in App Store Connect to submit scores or load leaderboards. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/submitScore(_:context:player:leaderboardIDs:completionHandler:)] class method to submit a score to one or more leaderboards. Alternatively, load a recurring leaderboard using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadLeaderboards(IDs:completionHandler:)] class method and then submit a score using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/submitScore(_:context:player:completionHandler:)] method. To learn more about recurring leaderboards, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/creating-recurring-leaderboards].\n\nTo retrieve information about all leaderboards in your game, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadLeaderboards(IDs:completionHandler:)] class method. To fetch the scores for a leaderboard, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadEntries(for:timeScope:range:completionHandler:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadEntries(for:timeScope:completionHandler:)] method. Use the parameters of these methods to filter the scores to the player’s friends, a rank, and time period when the score occurs.\n\nYou must create leaderboard objects using one of the load methods above. If the request is successful, GameKit passes corresponding [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard] objects to the handler. GameKit doesn’t load the images you add to App Store Connect when it loads the leaderboards. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadImage(completionHandler:)] method to get the image for a leaderboard.",
