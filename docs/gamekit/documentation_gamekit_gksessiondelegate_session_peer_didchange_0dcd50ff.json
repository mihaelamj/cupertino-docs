The action your delegate should take depends on what state the peer moved to.\n\n- When a peer first becomes visible to the session, it appears with a state of GKPeerStateAvailable.  Your application should show this peer in its user interface. If the peer changes its state to GKPeerStateUnavailable, it no longer accepts connection requests and your application should remove it from the user interface.\n- The delegate should ignore GKPeerStateConnecting changes and implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKSessionDelegate\/session(_:didReceiveConnectionRequestFromPeer:)] method instead.\n- When a peer is connected (GKPeerStateConnected), your application may send data to the peer and receive data from the peer. If a connection to a peer is lost or if the peer deliberately disconnects (GKPeerStateDisconnected), your application should stop sending messages to this peer.\n\n\n\n",
