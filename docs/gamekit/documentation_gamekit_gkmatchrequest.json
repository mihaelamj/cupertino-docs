  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo request a match, set the properties of the match request, such as the number of players, the invitation message, and whether to use automatch to fill the player slots. You’re required to set the minimum and maximum number of players allowed in the match. Then, pass the match request to the appropriate class, depending on the type of game and whether you implement your own user interface.\n\nTo use the matchmaking user interface that GameKit provides, pass the match request to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmakerViewController] class for real-time games, or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewController] class for turn-based games. GameKit sends messages to the delegates of these classes when players receive and accept invitations to the match.\n\nIf you implement your own interface for finding players, pass the match request to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker] class for real-time games, or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatch] class for turn-based games. If the player selects the other players to invite in your interface, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/recipients], the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/inviteMessage], and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/recipientResponseHandler] properties before creating the match.\n\n### Matchmaking using rules\n\nYou can refine the match results and reduce player wait times by configuring matchmaking before you present an interface. You can either find players using matchmaking rules you set up on the server, or find players from a subset of players you specify in the game.\n\nTo use matchmaking rules, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/queueName] property to the queue name that you configure in App Store Connect. Optionally, set [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/properties] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/recipientProperties] to game-specific criteria. Players in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/recipientProperties] property need to also be in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/recipients] property — that is, be a recipient of an invitation. When using matchmaking rules, Game Center ignores the subset that you specify using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/playerGroup] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/playerAttributes] properties.\n\nIf you set the request’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/minPlayers] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/maxPlayers] properties, use values that are in the rule set’s player range. Otherwise, the default values for these properties are the rule set’s `minPlayers` and `maxPlayers` fields (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/POST-v1-gameCenterMatchmakingRuleSets]).\n\nIf you don’t use matchmaking rules, you can restrict finding players to a subset of players. Set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/queueName] property to `nil`, and set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/playerGroup] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/playerAttributes] properties to specify the subset. Then matchmaking ignores the rules-based [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/properties] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest\/recipientProperties] properties.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/GameKit\/finding-players-using-matchmaking-rules].",
