For macOS apps, add the Group Activities capability to your Xcode to enable this feature.\n\nTo start a group activity on behalf of the player and receive callbacks for each player that joins, invoke the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/startGroupActivity(playerHandler:)] method. Implement the handler to add each player that joins to the match before starting gameplay using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/addPlayers(to:matchRequest:completionHandler:)] method.\n\nIf an app with a SharePlay interface isn’t running when you invoke the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/startGroupActivity(playerHandler:)] method, GameKit presents an interface that lets the player share a group activity in an app that supports SharePlay. Then the player can stop showing the group activity using the SharePlay interface, or you can stop the group activity on behalf of the player using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/stopGroupActivity()] method.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to present a familiar GameKit interface, instead present a [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmakerViewController] object that lets the player start a group activity by selecting SharePlay to invite players.",
