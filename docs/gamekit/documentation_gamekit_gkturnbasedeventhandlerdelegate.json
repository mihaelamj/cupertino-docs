All methods are called on the main thread.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nprotocol GKTurnBasedEventHandlerDelegate\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nThis protocol has been deprecated in iOS 7, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedEventListener].\n\n## Receiving Turn-based Events\n\n- **handleInvite(fromGameCenter:)**: Sent to the delegate when the local player receives an invitation to join a new turn-based match.\n- **handleTurnEvent(for:)**: Sent to the delegate when it is the local player’s turn to act in a turn-based match.\n- **handleTurnEvent(for:didBecomeActive:)**: Sent to the delegate when it is the local player’s turn to act in a turn-based match.\n- **handleMatchEnded(_:)**: Sent to the delegate when a match the local player is participating in has ended.\n\n## Deprecated protocols\n\n- **GKAchievementViewControllerDelegate**: An object implementing the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievementViewControllerDelegate] protocol is called when the user dismisses the achievements view controller. Typically, this protocol is implemented by the object in your game that originally displayed the achievements user interface.\n- **GKChallengeEventHandlerDelegate**: You implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKChallengeEventHandlerDelegate] delegate to control how challenges are displayed in your game.\n- **GKChallengesViewControllerDelegate**\n- **GKChallengeListener**: An object that responds to challenge events.\n- **GKFriendRequestComposeViewControllerDelegate**: The [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKFriendRequestComposeViewControllerDelegate] protocol is implemented by delegates of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKFriendRequestComposeViewController] class. The delegate is called when the player dismisses the friend request.\n- **GKGameSessionEventListener**: An event listener that handles game session events.\n- **GKLeaderboardViewControllerDelegate**: The [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboardViewControllerDelegate] protocol is implemented by delegates of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboardViewController] class. The delegate is called when the player dismisses the leaderboard.\n- **GKPeerPickerControllerDelegate**: The [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKPeerPickerControllerDelegate] protocol is implemented on an object to customize the behavior of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKPeerPickerController] object. The delegate is called by the peer picker to create a session object and to respond as the session is configured by the controller.\n- **GKSessionDelegate**: An object implements the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKSessionDelegate] protocol to control the behavior of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKSession] object. The delegate is called when other visible peers change their state relative to the session. It is also called to determine whether another peer is allowed to connect to the session.\n- **GKVoiceChatClient**: The [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKVoiceChatClient] protocol is implemented to control the behavior of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKVoiceChatService] object. The voice chat client has a number of responsibilities:\n\n",
