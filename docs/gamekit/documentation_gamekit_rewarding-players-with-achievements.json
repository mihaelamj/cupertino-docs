  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn *achievement* is a collectible item that a player receives as a reward for successfully reaching a particular goal in your game. Achievements provide players an additional way of engaging with your game, tracking gameplay progress, and sharing that progress with friends. You define the achievements available to players in your game, and Game Center saves the progress players make toward earning them. Players can view your game achievements and track their progress in the dashboard.\n\n\n\nYour game can have a maximum of 100 achievements, 100 points per achievement, and 1000 points total for all achievements. To keep players engaged, you can progressively add achievements to each version of your game until you reach the limit.\n\nFor design guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/game-center#Achievements].\n\n## Configure and test achievements\n\nConfigure achievements in Xcode before accessing them in your code and testing locally with Game Progress Manager. When you’re ready to deploy your configuration, sync your updates with App Store Connect. For more information about configuring and testing Game Center features, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/initializing-and-configuring-game-center].\n\nWhen you configure an achievement in Xcode, you specify details like how many points the players earn for it, and whether they can earn the achievement more than once.\n\n\n\nYou also localize the user-facing text and assets in each language and region you support, and specify whether to hide the achievement from players before they reach a goal in your game. If you don’t hide the achievement, Game Center shows it immediately in the locked state. Players can browse all the achievements in your game, including locked achievements, to learn more about them.\n\nIf you add an achievement to an unreleased version of your game or sign the game with a development certificate, Game Center annotates the achievement with a prerelease indicator. For example, if you run your game in Xcode, a prerelease indicator appears next to the achievement name and a message appears in the detail view. To change an achievement’s app version, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/configure-game-center\/add-achievements-to-an-app-version].\n\nUse the Game Progress Manager to test achievements on your local device before you push the configuration update to App Store Connect. After selecting an achievement, update the progress for it in the detail panel on the right. When the progress updates, the system sends an update to your app so you can verify that the achievement changes.\n\n\n\nFor more information about the achievement properties you can configure, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/reference\/achievements].\n\n## Get the object that represents the achievement\n\nTo start or continue reporting progress toward an achievement, you need a [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement] object that represents the achievement.\n\nLoad the in-progress achievements for the player using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/loadAchievements(completionHandler:)] method. Use the identifier you enter in Xcode to find the corresponding `GKAchievement` object in the array that GameKit passes to the completion handler.\n\nIf the achievement isn’t in the array, your game hasn’t reported any progress toward this achievement for this player yet, and the dashboard shows it in the locked state. You must create a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement] object using the identifier from App Store Connect. For the local player, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/init(identifier:)] method to create the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement] object. For another player, when ending a turn-based match, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/init(identifier:player:)] method.\n\n## Report the player’s progress\n\nInitially, the percentage complete is `0` and the dashboard shows the achievement in the locked state. As the player progresses toward earning an achievement, you report the percentage the player completes for the achievement to Game Center.\n\nSet the achievement’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/percentComplete] property to a value between `0` and `100`. For example, increase the percentage complete by 10%.\n\nThen report the progress to Game Center by passing the achievement in an array to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/report(_:withCompletionHandler:)] method.\n\nWhen reporting a percentage greater than `0` and less than `100`, the dashboard shows the achievement as in-progress. When you report that the player completes the achievement 100%, the dashboard shows the image for the achievement, and Game Center adds it to the player’s completed achievements.\n\nGameKit also displays a banner notifying the player when they complete an achievement. If you want to display your own interface, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/showsCompletionBanner] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] before reporting the player’s progress so the default banner doesn’t appear.\n\nYou can also hide an achievement in Xcode when you configure it, and not report on the progress until the player completes it. For example, use a hidden achievement if an achievement description reveals aspects of your game’s plot, or if you want to surprise the player with awards.\n\nIf the player completes all achievements in your game or if you want to clear all progress the local player makes toward all their achievements, you can reset them using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievement\/resetAchievements(completionHandler:)] class method.\n\nIf you prefer to report progress through your own server, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI\/game-center-player-achievements].\n\n## Show achievements to players\n\nPlayers can view their achievements in the dashboard, which provides a familiar and consistent experience for users. You can add the access point to your game so players can open the dashboard and navigate to their achievements. The access point displays achievements in the highlights, and on the dashboard when the player opens it. You can also display the dashboard in the state that shows the achievements so players can drill down and navigate to their other Game Center data.\n\nIf you want to display the data directly in your interface, you can load details of all the achievements, including their identifiers and artwork, using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievementDescription\/loadAchievementDescriptions(completionHandler:)] class method. GameKit returns the localized achievement titles and descriptions, which you provide when you configure the achievements in App Store Connect. To load the artwork for an achievement, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievementDescription\/loadImage(completionHandler:)] method.",
