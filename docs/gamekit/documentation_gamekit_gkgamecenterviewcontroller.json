You can present the dashboard in a specific state from which players can navigate to other areas, including their profile. Your game should pause other activities before presenting the dashboard.\n\nTo present the dashboard, initialize a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKGameCenterViewController] object and set its delegate. Optionally, initialize a view controller in a specific state, to show a leaderboard with scores from a set of players or during a time period, or to show a specific achievement. Then present the view controller to the player, and GameKit calls your delegate when the player dismisses it.\n\nFor visionOS games, the dashboard appears anchored to the window, scene, or view relative to where you present the view controller. For immersive games, set the parent window to a separate window group than the immersive space window group. For the visionOS location of the dashboard when using the access point, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/adding-an-access-point-to-your-game#Configure-the-access-point-on-visionOS].",
