Game Center is an Apple service that provides a single account that identifies players across all their games and devices. After players sign in to Game Center on their device, they can access their friends and use Game Center features you implement.\n\n\n\nBefore you can use GameKit classes, you must enable Game Center in your project and initialize the local player in your code; otherwise, your game receives a [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKError\/Code\/notAuthenticated] error.\n\nIf you have an existing Unity project, you can access the GameKit framework using the [https:\/\/github.com\/Apple\/UnityPlugins].\n\n### Implement Game Center features\n\nAfter you’ve enabled Game Center, you can implement many useful features to enhance the gaming experience.\n\nYou can add leaderboards that let players see how well they rank amongst friends and players all over the world. Create recurring leaderboards to organize regular competitions that provide players more chances to earn the top score. As players progress through your game, you can reward them with achievements that encourage them to keep playing.\n\nGameKit supports real-time and turn-based multiplayer experiences. Players can choose automatic matching or invite their friends to join a game. You can support turn-based gaming in which a match plays out over a series of alternating turns, and players can receive invitations even when your game isn’t in the foreground.\n\nGameKit also provides user interface components for your players to see highlights and access their Game Center data directly in your game. The access point provides a way for players to open a dashboard in which they can browse their profile, leaderboards, and achievements, as well as manage their friends list.\n\nFor designing Game Center features in your app, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/game-center].",

The access point provides a way for players to open a dashboard in which they can browse their profile, leaderboards, and achievements, as well as manage their friends list.\n\nFor designing Game Center features in your app, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/game-center].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Initializing and configuring Game Center**: Enable Game Center, configure features, and test them locally in your Xcode project.\n- **Authenticating a player**: Confirm player credentials and device capabilities and check for account restrictions.\n-
