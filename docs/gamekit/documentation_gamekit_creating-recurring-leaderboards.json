  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse a *recurring leaderboard* to organize regular competitions or encourage players to score higher in your game. Unlike a classic leaderboard that never resets, a recurring leaderboard represents score rankings during a period of time. Each leaderboard in the sequence is called an *occurrence*.\n\nFor design guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/game-center#Leaderboards].\n\n## Configure and test recurring leaderboards\n\nConfigure recurring leaderboards in Xcode before accessing them in your code and testing locally with Game Progress Manager. When you’re ready to deploy your configuration, sync your updates with App Store Connect. For more information about configuring and testing Game Center features, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/initializing-and-configuring-game-center].\n\nYou configure a recurring leaderboard like a classic leaderboard, but you also enable the Recurring setting, and configure time-related properties. Under the Recurring section, set a start date for the first occurrence. Then, enter the duration for each occurrence to establish the period in which players can earn scores. To specify the frequency of the occurrences, enter a restart interval. Occurrences are sequential and don’t overlap, so the restart interval must be equal to or greater than the duration. To create a time delay between occurrences, set the restart interval to a number that is greater than the duration.\n\n\n\nFor example, if the restart interval and duration are both 24 hours, the recurring leaderboard runs daily with no gaps between occurrences. To create a 1-hour contest every Sunday at noon, set the start date to Sunday at noon, then set the restart interval to 7 days and the duration to 60 minutes. To create a 15-minute competition every hour, set the restart interval to 60 minutes and the duration to 15 minutes.\n\nUse the Game Progress Manager to test leaderboards on your local device before you push the configuration update to App Store Connect. After selecting a leaderboard, you can add players to the leaderboard with a score value. Click Reset Leaderboards to simulate what happens in your game when the leaderboard occurrence ends. You can’t access previous occurrences of a recurring leaderboard in Debug Mode.\n\nTo learn more about the information you enter in App Store Connect, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/reference\/leaderboards#leaderboard-properties].\n\n## Submit a score to the current occurrence\n\nUse the leaderboard ID you entered in Xcode to specify the current occurrence when submitting a score. Don’t submit scores to past occurances leaderboards.\n\nTo submit a score to one or more leaderboards, including recurring leaderboards, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/submitScore(_:context:player:leaderboardIDs:completionHandler:)] class method in [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard]. Pass one or more leaderboard IDs, the score, context, and player. The `context` parameter is an optional value for game-specific data that you can store, and fetch later with the score. If there’s an occurrence at the time you submit the score, the occurrence retains either the best score or the most recent score.\n\nAlternatively, submit the score to the recurring leaderboard by loading the leaderboard using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadLeaderboards(IDs:completionHandler:)] method in [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard]. Then use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/submitScore(_:context:player:completionHandler:)] instance method to submit the score to the recurring leaderboard.\n\nHowever, submitting a score with this method fails if the leaderboard isn’t active, so check the start date and duration properties of the leaderboard before calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/submitScore(_:context:player:completionHandler:)] method. To get the start date of the next occurrence, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/nextStartDate] property.\n\n## Access the previous occurrence\n\nIf you want the scores and rankings from the previous occurrence, you can get the occurrence using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadPreviousOccurrence(completionHandler:)] method in [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard]. First, load the current occurrence using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadLeaderboards(IDs:completionHandler:)] class method, then call [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadPreviousOccurrence(completionHandler:)] to load the previous occurrence.",
