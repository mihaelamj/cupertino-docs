  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse the `GKMatchmaker` class to auto-match players for a quicker game start, programmatically invite specific players, or implement your own interface for players to invite other players. If you want to present a familiar matchmaking GameKit interface to players, instead use either the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmakerViewController] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKTurnBasedMatchmakerViewController] class.\n\nIf you host a game on your own server, you can also use this class to find Game Center players. That is, you implement the networking and communication between the players through your own servers not Game Center.\n\nTo find players using this class, create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchRequest] object and configure it according to the parameters of your game. Then, pass the match request and a handler using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/findMatch(for:withCompletionHandler:)] method, or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/findPlayers(forHostedMatchRequest:withCompletionHandler:)] method for hosted games, to the shared `GKMatchmaker` object.\n\nGameKit calls the handler when players accept their invitations. Implement the handler to set the delegate of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatch] object that GameKit sends and start the game when there are enough players.\n\nIf the match doesn’t have enough players (for example, some players decline their invitations), you can create another match request and call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/addPlayers(to:matchRequest:completionHandler:)] method repeatedly until the match’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatch\/expectedPlayerCount] property is zero. When you have enough players to start the match, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/finishMatchmaking(for:)] method to end the matchmaking process.\n\nIf you provide a SharePlay interface for inviting players, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/startGroupActivity(playerHandler:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKMatchmaker\/stopGroupActivity()] methods to create a group activity on behalf of the player.",
