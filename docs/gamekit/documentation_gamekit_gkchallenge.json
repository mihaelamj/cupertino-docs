When a player issues a challenge to another player, Game Center sends a push notification to the other player. That player can then accept or refuse the challenge. If the player accepts the challenge, Game Center adds the challenge to the player’s list of challenges. Later, if the player beats the challenge, Game Center notifies both players.\n\nGame Center supports two kinds of challenges:\n\nYou never subclass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKChallenge] class directly. However, you can subclass [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKScoreChallenge] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKAchievementChallenge] to create specific kinds of challenges.\n\n### Enable Challenges\n\nYou must enable challenges for your game in App Store Connect before you can use the challenges features.
