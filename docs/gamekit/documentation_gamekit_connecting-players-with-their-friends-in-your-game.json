  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nFriends are such an important part of social play that GameKit gives you privacy-friendly access to a player’s Game Center friends. For example, you can show what level friends are on in your game, launch a mission together with friends, or show a friends-only recurring leaderboard.\n\nIf the player has friends, you can access the list with their permission. The first time a player tries to use functionality in your game that requires Game Center friends access, the system displays a prompt asking the player whether your game can access their friends list. If the player grants access to their friends, you’ll have access only to friends who also grant access.\n\nFor example, if a player grants access, then only the friends who also grant your game access to their friends appear in the friends list. When a player grants access to their friends, GameKit syncs the permission across the player’s devices so the player only needs to respond to this system prompt once.\n\n\n\n### Sending friend requests\n\nGame Center provides an interface for sending and receiving friend requests including an inbox that shows requests that a player may have missed. Players can also send friend requests within your game. For example, use this feature to encourage players to add more friends in your multiplayer game.\n\nAdd a friend request button to your interface using an add person SF Symbol (for example, `person.crop.circle.badge.plus`) for the button image. For details on using SF Symbols, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/configuring-and-displaying-symbol-images-in-your-ui].\n\nImplement the button’s action to call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLocalPlayer\/presentFriendRequestCreator(from:)-7j1kn] method that presents the Game Center request friend view controller. After the player sends the friend request using this interface, this method dismisses the view controller and returns control to your game. Before continuing, check whether an error occurs sending the friend request.\n\n### Providing a reason to access the friends list\n\nYou must provide a reason to access a player’s friends by adding the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSGKFriendListUsageDescription] key to the information property list. The system displays the reason in the prompt it presents to the player to grant your game access. If you don’t provide this key, an error occurs when you attempt to access the friends.\n\nFor details on the system prompt, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/requesting-access-to-protected-resources].\n\n### Checking whether the player grants access\n\nDisplay the prompt to access friends when it’s convenient for the player by checking whether the player grants you permission to access their friends using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLocalPlayer\/loadFriendsAuthorizationStatus(_:)] method.\n\nFor example, if the player hasn’t denied or authorized access yet, you may want to delay accessing their friends until there’s a good moment to prompt the player for permission. To ensure you allow enough time for the player to make a decision, don’t display the prompt during game play.\n\nImplement the completion handler you pass to this method to take the appropriate action:\n\n### Accessing the player’s friends\n\nOnce the player grants access, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLocalPlayer\/loadFriends(_:)] method to get the friends who also grant you access to their friends.\n\nFor example, you can display details on their friends leaderboard scores to a player. Pass the friends array to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLeaderboard\/loadEntries(for:timeScope:completionHandler:)] leaderboard method to get their avatar, display name, and score on the leaderboard.",
