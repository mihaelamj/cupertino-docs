Players can track their scores on leaderboards, view achievement progress, participate in challenges, and more. Before you can use the GameKit framework and access Game Center data, you need to enable Game Center.

Players can track their scores on leaderboards, view achievement progress, participate in challenges, and more. Before you can use the GameKit framework and access Game Center data, you need to enable Game Center. When you enable Game Center in your project, Xcode adds the Game Center entitlement to your App ID.\n\nAfter you enable Game Center, you can configure the features you want to use in your game — like leaderboards, achievements, activites, and challenges — right in Xcode or in App Store Connect.\n\nFor more information about the Game Center service, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/configure-game-center\/overview-of-game-center].\n\n## Enable Game Center\n\nAdd the Game Center capability to your project, so you can configure gameplay features for your game:\n\n1. In Xcode, select the project in the main window.\n2. Select the target in the project editor that appears on the right.\n3. Click the Signing & Capabilities tab.\n4. Click the add capability button (+ Capability) in the toolbar.\n5. Add the Game Center capability by double-clicking on it.\n\n\n\nFor Mac targets, ensure that you enable both Incoming Connections and Outgoing Connections in the App Sandbox capability under Network.\n\n## Configure Game Center features\n\nUse a GameKit bundle file to configure achievements, activities, challenges, leaderboards, and leaderboard sets. You need to configure these features in Xcode before you can access them in your code and begin testing them. When you configure resources, you can organize the list in the way you want Game Center to present them.\n\nBegin configuring the feature you want by creating a GameKit bundle file:\n\n1. In Xcode 16.3 and later, choose File > New > File from Template.\n2. Choose either iOS or macOS as the platform.\n3. Scroll down to Other, and select the GameKit Bundle template.\n4. Click Next.\n5. In the sheet that appears, enter a name for the configuration and select the appropriate targets.\n6. Click Create.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re ready to deploy your configuration updates, sync them with App Store Connect. If you already configured features in App Store Connect, you can sync your existing configuration with the GameKit bundle file:\n\n1. At the bottom of the left column, click the More (…) button.\n2. Choose Pull from App Store Connect.\n3. Select your development team.\n4. Select the bundle ID or Game Center group.\n5. Click Pull.\n\nThe details for the resource then appear in the editor at right. If you already pushed your configuration changes to App Store Connect, removing a resource from the local configuration file doesn’t remove it from App Store Connect.\n\nIf you don’t have an app record in App Store Connect, create one so you can sync your configuration while you develop your game. To create an app record in App Store Connect that matches your App ID in your developer account, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/create-an-app-record\/add-a-new-app\/] in App Store Connect Help.

You can also use it to test features and deep links to your game.\n\nBefore testing your GameKit configuration, turn on Debug Mode in Xcode:\n\n1. Choose Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme.\n2. Select the Run configuration in the left column.\n3. Select Options.\n4. Scroll down to GameKit Configuration, and click the Enable Debug Mode checkbox.\n5. Click Close.\n\n\n\nTo test your configuration, open Game Progress Manager in Xcode:\n\n1. Choose Debug > GameKit > Manage Game Progress.\n2. In the sidebar, click the “Select a device” pop-up button, and select the physical device you use for testing.\n3. Click the pop-up button beneath that and select the project you want to debug.\n\nThe test data stays local to your machine and doesn’t rely on App Store Connect to test.\n\n\n\nAfter selecting the device and app, choose the Game Center feature you want to test. In the inspector panel for a resource, you can simulate a variety of updates, like achievement progress, leaderboard scores, and deep links to your game activities.\n\n\n\nTo reset the progress for your Game Center resource, click the reset button at the top of the Game Progress Manager. You can’t access previous occurrences of a resource after resetting the Game Progress Manager.\n\n## Initialize the local player\n\nIn your game, you need to initialize the local player before you can use any GameKit APIs and Game Center services.

When you initialize the player, you connect the player with the Game Center services.\n\nThe best time to initialize Game Center is when the player launches your game, so don’t hide initialization behind game menus or the settings screen. When you initialize the local player, Game Center:\n\n- Checks whether you configured your game for Game Center\n- Verifies the credentials of the player and ensures their account is ready for use\n\nTo initialize the player, set [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLocalPlayer\/authenticateHandler] on the shared instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLocalPlayer] that represents the player of your game:\n\n```swift\nGKLocalPlayer.local.authenticateHandler = { viewController, error in\n   \/\/ Handle the initialization callbacks.\n}\n```\n\nFor more information about initializing a local player, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/authenticating-a-player].\n\nYou use the handler to initialize Game Center. If you need to authenticate a person with your own server, continue the flow with [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/GKLocalPlayer\/fetchItems(forIdentityVerificationSignature:)].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Authenticating a player**: Confirm player credentials and device capabilities and check for account restrictions.\n- **Improving the player experience for games with large downloads**: Provide ample content in your base installation and then use on-demand resources and the Background Assets API to handle additional content.\n- **Game Center Entitlement**: A Boolean value that indicates whether users of the app may see and compare achievements on a leaderboard, invite friends, and start multiplayer games.\n\n",
