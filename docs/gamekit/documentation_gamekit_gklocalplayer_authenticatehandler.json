Set this property to a method that GameKit invokes during the initialization process. If `viewController` is `nil`, Game Center initializes the player and the player can start your game. Otherwise, present the view controller so the player can perform any additional actions to complete the process.\n\nGame Center may show a brief initialization screen if the player isn’t already signed into Game Center.\n\nFor more information about initializing Game Center with a local player, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.gamekit\/documentation\/GameKit\/authenticating-a-player].",
