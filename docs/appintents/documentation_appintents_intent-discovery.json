When someone performs an action in your app, donate an intent that corresponds to that action. The system uses the information you provide to predict actions someone might take in the future. For example, if someone requests the weather from your app each morning, the system might proactively offer the corresponding app intent at the same time each day.\n\nDonate intents only when someone uses your app’s interface directly. You don’t need to donate intents associated with Siri or interactions with the Shortcuts app because the system donates them automatically. You can also delete donations when someone cancels or reverses a previously executed action, or when the action is no longer relevant.",
