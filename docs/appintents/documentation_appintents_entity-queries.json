  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen the system needs to retrieve one or more specific instances of an app entity, it asks you to provide a relevant query type. The system uses queries during parameter resolution when the parameter of an intent contains an entity. The system also uses them to resolve information in a different format into one of your app’s entities. For example, it uses them to resolve natural spoken language into one of your app’s entities.\n\nThe system can sometimes determine which entities it needs and provide you with a list of corresponding identifiers. Provide an [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/EntityQuery] type to supply the entities for those identifiers. Provide additional query types to perform more advanced searches, such as a search that matches specific properties of the entity.",
