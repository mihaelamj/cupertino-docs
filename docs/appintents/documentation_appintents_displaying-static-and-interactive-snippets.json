  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUsing App Intents, you can integrate your app into the system, allowing people to perform actions from system experiences such as Spotlight or Control Center, the Action button, or Siri. To inform people about the outcome of an action you make available as an app intent, the intent can return a static snippet.\n\nMany of the actions you make available to the system as app intents are simple, and happen quickly. App intents can return an interactive snippet that allows people to perform an action from a snippet instead of viewing static information. Instead of taking a person out of their current context by launching your app from the app intent if it needs further action from the person, you can change the app intent to display an interactive snippet that shows the intent’s result, a way to confirm its action, or a button for a follow-up action.\n\nFor example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences] sample app offers an app intent to view details about the landmarks nearby. People might use it to create shortcuts and perform its action from Spotlight or the Action button. When the app intent finds information about a nearby landmark, it displays an interactive snippet with the most important information, a button to add it to a list favorites, and a button to search for available tickets if the landmark requires people to pay an entrance fee.\n\n### Show a static snippet\n\nIf your app intent doesn’t require a follow-up action, return a static snippet that enables someone to view the outcome of the app intent. To show a static snippet as a result from an app intent, return a view from your app intent’s `perform()` method:\n\n### Return an interactive snippet\n\nTo display an interactive snippet as a result of an app intent, create an app intent for your action - or use an existing app intent. For example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences] sample app provides landmark information might already have an app intent that finds a nearby landmark and returns information about it:\n\nTo display a snippet instead of just returning the app entity, change your intent’s `perform()` function to return a [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] in addition to the existing return value by adding `& ShowsSnippetIntent`. When you return a  [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/ShowsSnippetIntent] result from the intent, you let the system know that the action displays an interactive snippet. In the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences] example app, the previous example’s updated `perform()` method might look like this:\n\nIn the example, the intent returns a landmark entity by declaring `-> some ReturnsValue<LandmarkEntity>` and, additionally, returns a `LandmarkSnippetIntent`. This intent, an implementation of [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] , handles the snippet’s layout and interactive components.\n\nWhen you adopt interactive snippets, you might be able to reuse existing intents and add logic to display a snippet. Like the example above, you can return several results from an intent. By keeping an existing result type and additionally returning a snippet intent, you avoid breaking people’s custom shortcuts that use the previous version of your intent.\n\n### Create the interactive snippet\n\nAs described in the previous section, the intent that performs your app’s action can return a [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent]. The snippet intent constructs your snippet’s layout and returns it to the system, which then displays the interactive snippet. To return the views for your interactive snippet:\n\nThe following code continues the previous example and shows how the `AppIntentsTravelTracking` app might return a `LandmarkView` from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent]:\n\nNote the `isFavorite` parameter in the view’s initializer. The `LandmarkView` indicates whether a landmark is marked as a favorite already, and includes a button to add or remove it from favorites. The `LandMarkView` also includes a button to start a search for tickets to visit the landmark.\n\n### Review the lifecycle of snippet intents\n\nA snippet remains visible until a person dismisses it, and, similar to SwiftUI views, the system and a person’s actions might result in your [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] being created and performed multiple times during its lifecycle.\n\nFor example, the landmarks sample code project’s snippet includes a Favorites button to add or remove a nearby landmark from a list of favorites. When a person taps the Favorites button, the system performs the `FavoriteLandmarkIntent` to make the change. It discards the snippet’s old SwiftUI views, and performs the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] again to provide a new version of the snippet to show that the person added or removed the landmark from the list of favorites.\n\nIn the snippet intent’s `perform()` function, retrieve app state - for example, whether a current landmark is a favorite - and return an updated snippet as shown in the `LandmarkSnippetIntent ` example code above.\n\nBecause the system creates and performs your [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] repeatedly, make sure calling its `perform()` method doesn’t produce side effects:\n\n### Create a sequence of snippets and request confirmation\n\nWith interactive snippets, you can create quick, fast-flowing interactions, allowing people to view content and perform a series of actions without leaving their current context. For example, the landmark example might display a sequence of three snippets:\n\nTo create this sequence of snippets, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences] app uses a combination of regular app intents, a request for confirmation, and snippet intents.\n\nFirst, the app defines the `FindTicketsIntent`, a regular app intent to perform the search. In its `perform()` method, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/AppIntent\/requestConfirmation(conditions:actionName:dialog:showDialogAsPrompt:snippetIntent:)-3vewj] API displays the interactive snippet for people to enter the tickets, using the  `TicketRequestSnippetIntent`.\n\nWhen the person has entered the number of tickets in the snippet that `TicketRequestSnippetIntent` presents, they confirm the number of tickets and the search starts. The search results appear in a third snippet that the  `TicketResultSnippetIntent` presents:\n\nBy displaying the snippet using the `requestConfirmation()` API, the snippet includes the option to cancel the action. If the person doesn’t confirm the number of tickets, the app intent doesn’t continue its `perform()` function, perform the search, or display another snippet.\n\n### Reload a snippet to display updated data\n\nIn the above example, three snippets appear in a sequence, each snippet replacing the previous snippet. If a snippet remains onscreen for some time; for example, if you perform a search like the in the example; reload the snippet to let people know that the search is ongoing. Similarly, reload the snippet if its underlying data changes.\n\nTo reload a snippet, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent\/reload()] function defined by [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] . The following example adds it to the trailing closure of the search method:",

For example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences] sample app provides landmark information might already have an app intent that finds a nearby landmark and returns information about it:\n\n```swift\nstruct ClosestLandmarkIntent: AppIntent {\n    static let title: LocalizedStringResource = \"Find Closest Landmark\"\n\n    func perform() async throws -> some ReturnsValue<LandmarkEntity> & ShowsSnippetIntent {\n        let landmark = await self.findClosestLandmark()\n\n        return .result(\n            value: landmarkEntity \/\/ Return information about the landmark.\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo display a snippet instead of just returning the app entity, change your intent’s `perform()` function to return a [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] in addition to the existing return value by adding `& ShowsSnippetIntent`.

This intent, an implementation of [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] , handles the snippet’s layout and interactive components.\n\nWhen you adopt interactive snippets, you might be able to reuse existing intents and add logic to display a snippet. Like the example above, you can return several results from an intent. By keeping an existing result type and additionally returning a snippet intent, you avoid breaking people’s custom shortcuts that use the previous version of your intent.\n\n### Create the interactive snippet\n\nAs described in the previous section, the intent that performs your app’s action can return a [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent]. The snippet intent constructs your snippet’s layout and returns it to the system, which then displays the interactive snippet. To return the views for your interactive snippet:\n\n1. Create an app intent that conforms to [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent].\n2. Make sure the intent’s `perform()` method returns a [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/ShowsSnippetView].\n\nThe following code continues the previous example and shows how the `AppIntentsTravelTracking` app might return a `LandmarkView` from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent]:\n\n```swift\nimport AppIntents\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct LandmarkSnippetIntent: SnippetIntent {\n    static let title: LocalizedStringResource = \"Landmark Snippet\"\n\n    @Parameter var landmark: LandmarkEntity\n    @Dependency var modelData: ModelData\n\n    func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult & ShowsSnippetView {\n        let isFavorite = await modelData.isFavorite(landmark)\n\n        return .result(\n            view: LandmarkView(landmark: landmark, isFavorite: isFavorite)\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nextension LandmarkSnippetIntent {\n    init(landmark: LandmarkEntity) {\n        self.landmark = landmark\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote the `isFavorite` parameter in the view’s initializer. The `LandmarkView` indicates whether a landmark is marked as a favorite already, and includes a button to add or remove it from favorites. The `LandMarkView` also includes a button to start a search for tickets to visit the landmark.\n\n\n\n### Review the lifecycle of snippet intents\n\nA snippet remains visible until a person dismisses it, and, similar to SwiftUI views, the system and a person’s actions might result in your [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] being created and performed multiple times during its lifecycle.\n\nFor example, the landmarks sample code project’s snippet includes a Favorites button to add or remove a nearby landmark from a list of favorites.

It discards the snippet’s old SwiftUI views, and performs the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] again to provide a new version of the snippet to show that the person added or removed the landmark from the list of favorites.\n\n\n\nIn the snippet intent’s `perform()` function, retrieve app state - for example, whether a current landmark is a favorite - and return an updated snippet as shown in the `LandmarkSnippetIntent ` example code above.\n\nBecause the system creates and performs your [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] repeatedly, make sure calling its `perform()` method doesn’t produce side effects:\n\n- If you pass data between intents, pass a minimum amount of immutable data.\n- Avoiding long-running tasks to ensure the snippet appears responsive.\n- Fetch dynamic values from a shared object instead of passing them around as parameters between intents; for example, the `LandmarkSnippetIntent` above uses an [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/AppDependency] for its `modelData`.\n\n\n\n### Create a sequence of snippets and request confirmation\n\nWith interactive snippets, you can create quick, fast-flowing interactions, allowing people to view content and perform a series of actions without leaving their current context. For example, the landmark example might display a sequence of three snippets:\n\n1. When a person performs the “Find Closest” App Shortcut, the landmarks snippet described above appears. It includes a button to search for tickets for the nearby landmark.\n2. When a person taps the button to search for tickets, a second snippet appears, requesting confirmation of the total number of tickets. When they’ve adjusted the number of tickets and confirmed the number of tickets, the search starts.\n3. When the search finishes, a third snippet appears to display the total amount for the number of tickets and a buy button.\n\nTo create this sequence of snippets, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/adopting-app-intents-to-support-system-experiences] app uses a combination of regular app intents, a request for confirmation, and snippet intents.\n\nFirst, the app defines the `FindTicketsIntent`, a regular app intent to perform the search. In its `perform()` method, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/AppIntent\/requestConfirmation(conditions:actionName:dialog:showDialogAsPrompt:snippetIntent:)-3vewj] API displays the interactive snippet for people to enter the tickets, using the  `TicketRequestSnippetIntent`.\n\n```swift\nimport AppIntents\n\nstruct FindTicketsIntent: AppIntent {\n\n    \/\/ ...\n\n    func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult & ShowsSnippetIntent {\n        let searchRequest = await searchEngine.createRequest(landmarkEntity: landmark)\n\n        \/\/ Present a snippet that allows people to change\n        \/\/ the number of tickets.\n        try await requestConfirmation(\n            actionName: .search,\n            snippetIntent: TicketRequestSnippetIntent(searchRequest: searchRequest)\n        )\n        \n        \/\/ ...\n    }\n}\n\n\/\/ ...\n```\n\nWhen the person has entered the number of tickets in the snippet that `TicketRequestSnippetIntent` presents, they confirm the number of tickets and the search starts. The search results appear in a third snippet that the  `TicketResultSnippetIntent` presents:\n\n```swift\n\/\/ ...\n\nfunc perform() async throws -> some IntentResult & ShowsSnippetIntent {\n    let searchRequest = await searchEngine.createRequest(landmarkEntity: landmark)\n\n    \/\/ Present a snippet that allows people to change\n    \/\/ the number of tickets.\n    try await requestConfirmation(\n        actionName: .search,\n        snippetIntent: TicketRequestSnippetIntent(searchRequest: searchRequest)\n    )\n    \n    \/\/ If the person has confirmed the action, perform the ticket search.\n    try await searchEngine.performRequest(request: searchRequest)\n\n    \/\/ Show the result of the ticket search.\n    return .result(\n        snippetIntent: TicketResultSnippetIntent(\n            searchRequest: searchRequest\n        )\n    )\n}\n\n\/\/ ...\n```\n\nBy displaying the snippet using the `requestConfirmation()` API, the snippet includes the option to cancel the action. If the person doesn’t confirm the number of tickets, the app intent doesn’t continue its `perform()` function, perform the search, or display another snippet.\n\n### Reload a snippet to display updated data\n\nIn the above example, three snippets appear in a sequence, each snippet replacing the previous snippet. If a snippet remains onscreen for some time; for example, if you perform a search like the in the example; reload the snippet to let people know that the search is ongoing. Similarly, reload the snippet if its underlying data changes.\n\nTo reload a snippet, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent\/reload()] function defined by [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/SnippetIntent] . The following example adds it to the trailing closure of the search method:\n\n```swift\n\/\/ ...\n\nfunc perform() async throws -> some IntentResult & ShowsSnippetIntent {\n    \/\/ ...\n        \n    \/\/ If the person has confirmed the action, perform the ticket search.\n    try await searchEngine.performRequest(request: searchRequest) {\n        \/\/ Creates and reloads the TicketResultSnippetIntent.\n        TicketResultSnippetIntent.reload()\n    }\n\n    \/\/ Show the result of the ticket search.\n    return .result(\n        snippetIntent: TicketResultSnippetIntent(\n            searchRequest: searchRequest\n        )\n    )\n}\n\n\/\/ ...\n```\n\n\n\n## Interactive Snippets\n\n- **SnippetIntent**: An app intent that presents an interactive snippet onscreen.\n\n",
