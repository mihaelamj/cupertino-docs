For example, natural spoken language commands from Siri are strings, but your app intent might require an integer or floating-point value instead. Resolvers let the system translate one type to another automatically.\n\nThe system provides resolvers to convert between integer, floating-point, Boolean, string, and URL types. As needed, the system can chain multiple resolvers together to translate between types for which no single resolver exists. For example, it can translate an integer into a string and then translate the string into a Boolean value. If your app defines custom types, create your own resolvers to translate those types to more recognizable values.",
