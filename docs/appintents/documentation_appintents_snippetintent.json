  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn app intent can present custom SwiftUI views to show people the result of their action, confirm a selection, and more. For example, an app could show a confirmation for a successful order.\n\nBy conforming your app intent to the `SnippetIntent` protocol, you can provide a *snippet*, a custom view with interactivity. Similar to widgets and Live Activities, a snippet can include buttons or toggles that use an [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/AppIntent] for their functionality. In many cases, you might be able to reuse views of your interactive widget or Live Activity.\n\nThe following code snippet shows what the perform method for a task management app could look like. The intent asynchronously loads a list of tasks and presents it using the `TodoListView` that the `perform()` function returns. The `TodoListView` could then offer a toggle for each item in the list to immediately mark a task as completed.\n\nWhen someone interacts with a snippet’s button or a toggle, the system first performs its associated app intent. When the button or toggle’s intent completes, the system calls the snippet intent’s `perform()` method again. In your snippet intent’s `perform()` implementation, make sure to handle multiple calls of `perform()`. For example, the example above would need to fetch the list of tasks to make sure it displays the most recent data. If a user completes a task from a snippet, the snippet needs to reflect this change and show the task as completed or remove it from the list of tasks.\n\nIf your intent does more than just returning a snippet; for example, if you extend an app intent that returns a value to also return a snippet; the intent is automatically discoverable in the Shortcuts app and Spotlight. If an app intent conforms to `SnippetIntent` and only returns a snippet — their return type only conforms to [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/IntentResult] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/ShowsSnippetView] —, it’s nondiscoverable by the Shortcuts app and in Spotlight. To make such an intent discoverable, explicitly set [doc:\/\/com.apple.AppIntents\/documentation\/AppIntents\/AppIntent\/isDiscoverable] to `true`.",
