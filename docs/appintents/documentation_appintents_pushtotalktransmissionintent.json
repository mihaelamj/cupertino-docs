For additional information about transmitting audio with the Push to Talk framework, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PushToTalk].\n\n## Actions\n\n- **AppIntent**: An interface for providing an app-specific capability that people invoke from system experiences like Siri and the Shortcuts app.\n- **AudioPlaybackIntent**: An App Intent that plays, pauses, or otherwise modifies audio playback state when it executes.\n- **AudioRecordingIntent**: An app intent that starts, stops or otherwise modifies audio recording state.\n- **AudioStartingIntent**: An App Intent that plays, pauses, or otherwise modifies audio playback state when it executes.\n- **CameraCaptureIntent**: Designates intent that will launch an activity that uses device’s camera to capture photos or videos. Marking your intent with this protocol makes it available as a possible action for Camera quick action.\n- **DeleteIntent**: Delete the associated entity(s).\n- **DeprecatedAppIntent**: An app intent that marks an action as deprecated and informs people which action to use instead.\n- **ForegroundContinuableIntent**: A protocol you use for app intents which begin their work with the app in the background but may request to continue in the foreground.\n- **OpenIntent**: Open the associated item.\n- **OpenURLIntent**: An intent that opens a universal link.\n- **PlayVideoIntent**: An intent that looks for videos based on a search term, then plays the content.\n- **ProgressReportingIntent**: An intent that reports progress to the system during its execution\n- **URLRepresentableIntent**: An app intent with a URL representation.\n- **SetValueIntent**: An intent that contains a value which can be set.\n- **ShowInAppSearchResultsIntent**: An app intent that takes a person to search results for a specified search term.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- AppIntent\n- PersistentlyIdentifiable\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n- SystemIntent\n\n",
