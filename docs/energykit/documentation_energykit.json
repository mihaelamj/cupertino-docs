It’s meant for residential, behind-the-meter applications, such as electricity usage of household devices, appliances, and EV charging. It’s not meant for commercial or industrial applications. The system is designed for initial use cases involving smart thermostats (HVAC) and EV charging.\n\n\n\nUsing EnergyKit, your app can:\n\n## Add the entitlement to your app\n\nTo use EnergyKit, the system requires your app to have the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.energykit] entitlement with a value of `true`.
