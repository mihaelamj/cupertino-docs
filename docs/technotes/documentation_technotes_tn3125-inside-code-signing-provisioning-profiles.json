  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nCode signing is a foundational technology on all Apple platforms.  Many documents that discuss code signing focus on solving a specific problem.  The *Inside Code Signing* technote series is different: It peeks behind the code signing curtain, to give you a better understanding of how this technology works.  Read these technotes to make better code signing choices up front, to understand why Apple’s code signing tools work the way they do, to inform your investigation of any code signing issues you encounter, and because learning stuff is fun!\n\nThe other technotes in the *Inside Code Signing* series are:\n\n## Provisioning profile fundamentals\n\nApple platforms, except macOS, won’t run arbitrary third-party code.  All execution of third-party code must be authorized by Apple.  This authorization comes in the form of a provisioning profile, which ties together five criteria:\n\nYou create provisioning profiles using the Apple Developer website, either directly using the website or indirectly using Xcode or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI].\n\nWhen the Apple Developer website creates a profile for you, it cryptographically signs it.  When you run an app on a device, the device checks this signature to determine if the profile is valid and, if so, checks that the app meets the criteria in the profile.\n\nThere is one interesting edge case with provisioning profiles: When you submit your app to the App Store, the App Store re-signs the app as part of the distribution process.  Before doing that, it checks that the app is signed and provisioned correctly.  That check means that each individual device doesn’t need to perform further security checks, so the final app doesn’t have a provisioning profile.  However, this third-party code was still authorized by a profile, albeit during the App Store distribution process.\n\n## Unpack a profile\n\nA provisioning profile is a property list wrapped within a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signature.  To view the original property list, remove the CMS wrapper using the `security` tool:\n\nFor more details on CMS, see [https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc5652].\n\nTo illustrate this point, the traditional property list view of a profile is no longer the source of truth on modern systems.  Rather, each profile contains a `DER-Encoded-Profile` property which holds a binary form of the profile that’s the new source of truth.  For more on this switch, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.technotes\/documentation\/Technotes\/tn3125-inside-code-signing-provisioning-profiles#The-future-is-DER].\n\nStill, the property list is easier to read and so the bulk of this technote focuses on that.\n\nFor more information about the tools used in these examples, read their man pages.  If you’re unfamiliar with that process, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/os\/reading-unix-manual-pages].\n\n## The who\n\nEvery profile has a `DeveloperCertificates` property holding the certificates of each developer who can sign code covered by the profile.  For example:\n\nTo extract a specific certificate, add its index to the key path:\n\nTo learn more about code-signing certificates, read [doc:\/\/com.apple.technotes\/documentation\/Technotes\/tn3161-inside-code-signing-certificates].\n\n## The what\n\nMost profiles apply to a single App ID, encoded in the `Entitlements` > `application-identifier` property:\n\nThis property holds an App ID, composed of an App ID prefix and a bundle ID.  In this example `SKMME9E2Y8` is the App ID prefix and `com.example.apple-samplecode.ProfileExplainer` is the bundle ID.\n\nA profile might refer to a wildcard App ID:\n\nThis profile applies to any app whose App ID starts with `SKMME9E2Y8.com.example.apple-samplecode.`\n\n## The where\n\nMost profiles apply to a specific list of devices.  This is encoded in the `ProvisionedDevices` property:\n\nApp Store distribution profiles have no `ProvisionedDevices` property because you can’t run an App Store distribution signed app locally.\n\nDeveloper ID and In-House (Enterprise) distribution profiles have the `ProvisionsAllDevices` property, indicating that they apply to all devices.  For more details about Developer ID provisioning profiles on the Mac, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.technotes\/documentation\/Technotes\/tn3125-inside-code-signing-provisioning-profiles#Entitlements-on-macOS].\n\n## The when\n\nEvery profile has an `ExpirationDate` property which limits how long the profile remains valid.  For example:\n\nThis validity period varies by profile type, but it’s typically not more than a year.  The exception here is Developer ID profiles, which have an expiration date far in the future.\n\n## The how\n\nEvery profile has an `Entitlements` property which authorizes the app to use specific entitlements.  For example:\n\nThe entitlements in the profile act as an allowlist.  This isn’t the same as the entitlements claimed by the app.  To actually claim an entitlement, include the entitlement in the app’s code signature.\n\nEvery entitlement claimed by the app must be in the profile’s allowlist but the reverse isn’t true.  It’s fine for the allowlist to include entitlements that the app doesn’t claim.\n\nSome entitlements in the allowlist use wildcard syntax.  In the above example, `SKMME9E2Y8.*` means that the app can claim any keychain access group with the `SKMME9E2Y8.` prefix.  Wildcards don’t make sense in the app’s code signature.\n\nTo dump the entitlements claimed by the app, use `codesign` with the `--entitlements` argument:\n\nEvery entitlement claimed by this app is authorized by its profile, and thus iOS allows the app to run.  Note that the `keychain-access-groups` value, `SKMME9E2Y8.com.example.apple-samplecode.ProfileExplainer`, starts with `SKMME9E2Y8.` and thus is allowed by the wildcard.\n\n## Entitlements on macOS\n\nA macOS app can claim certain entitlements without them being authorized by a provisioning profile.  These *unrestricted entitlements* include:\n\nIn contrast, *restricted entitlements* must be authorized by a provisioning profile.  This is an important security feature on macOS.  For example, the fact that the `keychain-access-groups` entitlement must be authorized by a profile means that other developers can’t impersonate your app in order to steal its keychain items.\n\nA Mac app that uses no restricted entitlements doesn’t need a provisioning profile.  This is true even if the app is distributed on the App Store.  The only exception to this rule is TestFlight, which always requires a profile.\n\nmacOS supports provisioning profiles for both App Store and Developer ID distribution.  Some entitlements are not supported by Developer ID profiles.  For the details, see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/developer-account\/#\/devadf555df9] in [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/developer-account\/].  For general information about Developer ID signing, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/developer-id\/]\n\n## Profile location\n\nIn the early days of iOS development it was common to install a provisioning profile on the device as a whole (in the Settings app).  That’s still possible, but current best practice is to embed the profile within the app itself:\n\nNote that macOS also uses a different file name extension for provisioning profiles.\n\nApps that you download from the App Store don’t contain an embedded provisioning profile because the App Store checks that the app is signed and provisioned correctly as part of its distribution process.\n\nSome macOS products, like daemons and command-line tools, ship as a standalone executable.  A standalone executable can’t claim a restricted entitlement because there’s no place to embed the provisioning profile that authorizes that claim.  If your standalone executable needs to do this, wrap it in an app-like structure.  For an example of this, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/signing-a-daemon-with-a-restricted-entitlement].\n\n## The future is DER\n\nModern systems no longer treat the profile’s property list as the source of truth.  Rather, they use the binary form of the profile stored in the profile’s `DER-Encoded-Profile` property:\n\nThis form of the profile is encoded as DER, a binary encoding of ASN.1 that’s common in cryptographic file formats.  To extract it, first extract the property to a file:\n\nThis is a whole new copy of the profile, so undo the CMS wrapper again:\n\nFinally, dump the DER-encoded payload itself:\n\nThis output contains mostly the same information as the property list, just encoded in DER form.\n\nThe one exception is the `DeveloperCertificates` property.  This doesn’t contain a full copy of each certificate, but rather a SHA-256 checksum of the certificate.  Assuming the certificate extracted from the property list earlier as `cert0.cer`, run `shasum` to confirm that checksum:\n\nThis DER-encoded profile is required starting with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8.  For more on that change, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/using-the-latest-code-signature-format].\n\n## Revision History",

Note that the `keychain-access-groups` value, `SKMME9E2Y8.com.example.apple-samplecode.ProfileExplainer`, starts with `SKMME9E2Y8.` and thus is allowed by the wildcard.\n\n## Entitlements on macOS\n\nA macOS app can claim certain entitlements without them being authorized by a provisioning profile.  These *unrestricted entitlements* include:\n\n- `com.apple.security.get-task-allow`\n- `com.apple.security.application-groups`\n- Those used to enable and configure the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/app-sandbox]\n- Those used to configure the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/hardened-runtime]\n\n\n\nIn contrast, *restricted entitlements* must be authorized by a provisioning profile.  This is an important security feature on macOS.  For example, the fact that the `keychain-access-groups` entitlement must be authorized by a profile means that other developers can’t impersonate your app in order to steal its keychain items.\n\nA Mac app that uses no restricted entitlements doesn’t need a provisioning profile.  This is true even if the app is distributed on the App Store.  The only exception to this rule is TestFlight, which always requires a profile.\n\nmacOS supports provisioning profiles for both App Store and Developer ID distribution.  Some entitlements are not supported by Developer ID profiles.  For the details, see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/developer-account\/#\/devadf555df9] in [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/developer-account\/].  For general information about Developer ID signing, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/developer-id\/]\n\n## Profile location\n\nIn the early days of iOS development it was common to install a provisioning profile on the device as a whole (in the Settings app).  That’s still possible, but current best practice is to embed the profile within the app itself:\n\n- macOS expects to find the profile at `MyApp.app\/Contents\/embedded.provisionprofile`.\n- Other Apple platforms expect to find the profile at `MyApp.app\/embedded.mobileprovision`.\n\nNote that macOS also uses a different file name extension for provisioning profiles.\n\nApps that you download from the App Store don’t contain an embedded provisioning profile because the App Store checks that the app is signed and provisioned correctly as part of its distribution process.\n\nSome macOS products, like daemons and command-line tools, ship as a standalone executable.  A standalone executable can’t claim a restricted entitlement because there’s no place to embed the provisioning profile that authorizes that claim.  If your standalone executable needs to do this, wrap it in an app-like structure.  For an example of this, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/signing-a-daemon-with-a-restricted-entitlement].\n\n## The future is DER\n\nModern systems no longer treat the profile’s property list as the source of truth.  Rather, they use the binary form of the profile stored in the profile’s `DER-Encoded-Profile` property:\n\n```shell\n% plutil -extract DER-Encoded-Profile raw -o - Profile_Explainer_iOS_Dev-payload.plist\nMIINQQYJKoZIhvcNAQcCoIINMjCCDS4CAQExDzANBglghkgBZQMEAgEFADCCAvwGCSqG…\n```\n\nThis form of the profile is encoded as DER, a binary encoding of ASN.1 that’s common in cryptographic file formats.  To extract it, first extract the property to a file:\n\n```shell\n% plutil -extract DER-Encoded-Profile raw Profile_Explainer_iOS_Dev-payload.plist | base64 -D > Profile_Explainer_iOS_Dev.der \n```\n\nThis is a whole new copy of the profile, so undo the CMS wrapper again:\n\n```shell\n% security cms -D -i Profile_Explainer_iOS_Dev.der -o Profile_Explainer_iOS_Dev-payload.der \n```\n\nFinally, dump the DER-encoded payload itself:\n\n```shell\n% openssl asn1parse -in Profile_Explainer_iOS_Dev-payload.der -inform der -i | cut -c 30- \nSET               \n …\n SEQUENCE          \n  UTF8STRING        :ExpirationDate\n  UTCTIME           :220723143034Z\n …\n SEQUENCE          \n  UTF8STRING        :ProvisionedDevices\n  SEQUENCE          \n   UTF8STRING        :00008030-001544522E60802E\n SEQUENCE          \n  UTF8STRING        :DeveloperCertificates\n  SEQUENCE          \n   OCTET STRING      [HEX DUMP]:1A6836292903FEFEB3A1303507436AD808BEDE7100E360F8F632579AC7EACA96\n SEQUENCE          \n  UTF8STRING        :Entitlements\n  appl [ 16 ]       \n   INTEGER           :01\n   cont [ 16 ]       \n    SEQUENCE          \n     UTF8STRING        :application-identifier\n     UTF8STRING        :SKMME9E2Y8.com.example.apple-samplecode.ProfileExplainer\n    SEQUENCE          \n     UTF8STRING        :com.apple.developer.team-identifier\n     UTF8STRING        :SKMME9E2Y8\n    SEQUENCE          \n     UTF8STRING        :get-task-allow\n     BOOLEAN           :255\n    SEQUENCE          \n     UTF8STRING        :keychain-access-groups\n     SEQUENCE          \n      UTF8STRING        :SKMME9E2Y8.*\n      UTF8STRING        :com.apple.token\n```\n\nThis output contains mostly the same information as the property list, just encoded in DER form.\n\nThe one exception is the `DeveloperCertificates` property.  This doesn’t contain a full copy of each certificate, but rather a SHA-256 checksum of the certificate.  Assuming the certificate extracted from the property list earlier as `cert0.cer`, run `shasum` to confirm that checksum:\n\n```shell\n% shasum -a 256 cert0.cer\n1a6836292903fefeb3a1303507436ad808bede7100e360f8f632579ac7eaca96 …\n```\n\nThis DER-encoded profile is required starting with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, tvOS 15, and watchOS 8.
