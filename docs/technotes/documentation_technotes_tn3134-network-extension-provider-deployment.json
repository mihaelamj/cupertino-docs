You might implement a custom VPN protocol with a packet tunnel provider, or add a content filter provider as part of a parental control app.  Network Extension supports many different provider types and each type has different deployment requirements.  The tables below summarise these requirements for each provider type.\n\nWhen reading these tables:\n\n- The Mac Catalyst platform refers to a provider embedded in a Mac Catalyst app running on Mac.  For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/mac-catalyst].\n- The iOS Apps on Mac platform refers to a provider embedded in an iOS app running on an Apple silicon Mac.  For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Apple-Silicon\/running-your-ios-apps-in-macos].\n- On macOS most Network Extension provider types can be packaged as either an app extension or a system extension.  App extensions run in a user context; if the user logs out, the provider is terminated.  System extensions run in a global context, completely independent of the logged in user.\n- When a provider’s per-app configuration is restricted to managed devices, the targeted apps must be installed using MDM.\n- If a macOS row doesn’t mention the “App Store only” restriction, the provider supports both App Store distribution and direct distribution using Developer ID signing.\n\nFor more information about using the Network Extension framework as a whole, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension].\n\n## Deploying a packet tunnel provider\n\nWhen building a packet tunnel provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/packet-tunnel-provider].\n\nBefore you decide to implement a packet tunnel provider, read [doc:\/\/com.apple.technotes\/documentation\/Technotes\/tn3120-expected-use-cases-for-network-extension-packet-tunnel-providers].\n\n## Deploying an app proxy provider\n\nWhen building an app proxy provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/app-proxy-provider].\n\n## Deploying a URL filter provider\n\nWhen building a URL filter provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/url-filters].\n\n## Deploying a content filter provider\n\nWhen building a content filter provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/content-filter-providers].\n\nIn the Screen Time case, content filters are only supported on child devices.  To enable a content filter:\n\n1. Add the Family Controls capability to your app.  See [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app].\n2. Run it on a device where the user has signed in as an under 18 child member of an iCloud family.\n3. Request child authorization. On iOS 16 and later, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/FamilyControls\/AuthorizationCenter\/requestAuthorization(for:)], passing in the `.child` option. On iOS 15, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/FamilyControls\/AuthorizationCenter\/requestAuthorization(completionHandler:)], which always requests child authorization.\n4. Authorize that as the child’s parent or guardian.\n\nBefore submitting your app to the App Store, you must request permission to use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.family-controls] entitlement for distribution.\n\n## Deploying a DNS proxy provider\n\nWhen building a DNS proxy provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/dns-proxy-provider].\n\n## Deploying a transparent proxy provider\n\nWhen building a transparent proxy provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see the discussion of transparent proxies within [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/app-proxy-provider].\n\nmacOS 11.0 introduced significant improvements to the transparent proxy feature; for the details, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NETransparentProxyProvider].\n\n## Deploying a packet filter provider\n\nWhen building a packet filter provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/content-filter-providers].\n\n## Deploying an Ethernet tunnel provider\n\nWhen building an Ethernet tunnel provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/NEEthernetTunnelProvider].\n\n## Deploying an app push provider\n\nWhen building an app push provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/local-push-connectivity].\n\n## Deploying a hotspot provider\n\nWhen building a hotspot provider, use the following table to plan your deployment:\n\n\n\nFor more information about hotspot providers, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/hotspot-helper].\n\nBefore starting development, request permission to use the `com.apple.developer.networking.HotspotHelper` entitlement.  See [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NetworkExtension\/hotspot-helper] for the details.\n\n## Revision History\n\n- **2025-08-19** Added sections for URL filter and hotspot providers.
