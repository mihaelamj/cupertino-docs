StoreKit Testing in Xcode is a local test environment for testing In-App Purchases without requiring a connection to App Store servers. To set up testing in this environment, add a local or synced StoreKit configuration file that contains In-App Purchases to your Xcode project. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Create-a-StoreKit-configuration-file]. When you [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Enable-StoreKit-Testing-in-Xcode] in your Xcode project, this file becomes active. StoreKit uses data saved in the active configuration file when your app calls StoreKit APIs in the test environment. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode].\n\nTo offer In-App Purchases in your app, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/products(for:)] with a list of [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/reference\/in-app-purchase-information] (`Product ID`) matching these products in the test environment. `Product.products(for:)` returns an array that includes an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product] for each of the In-App Purchases. Update your app’s UI with these returned instances, which contain all In-App Purchase information set up in the active configuration file for your app.\n\nIf `Product.products(for:)` fails to return a Product instance for your In-App Purchases, it may be due to the following reasons:\n\n## Validate your product identifier list\n\nInspect the active StoreKit configuration file in your Xcode project. Confirm each product identifier in your list matches the product identifier of an In-App Purchase configured in this file.\n\n## Disable the Simulated StoreKit Load Products failure setting\n\nA [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode#Create-a-StoreKit-configuration-file] includes settings you can use to specify test conditions or scenarios for your In-App Purchases such as Load Products. When you enable Load Products, the test environment simulates the load product failure scenario you specified such as network error. Calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Product\/products(for:)] in your app throws a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/StoreKitError]. When you disable this setting, the function returns all your In-App Purchases that exist in the active configuration file.
