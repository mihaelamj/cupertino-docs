  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo call the Automatic Sign-In API, the web service requires you to include identifying information in the header of your request. The information is a *bearer token*, which is a string that specifies your organization as the token creator, and certifies the authenticity of the entity making the request. An example call to the API looks like this:\n\nThe `[token string]` format is JSON Web Token (JWT), which consists of a header and a payload. The information you add in the token primarily provides the web service with:\n\n## Generate an API key or access an existing key\n\nAutomatic Sign-In API relies on the same authentication mechanism as StoreKit, so the web service checks the request header for an identifier of an In-App Purchase API key. App Store Connect issues your development team a unique key ID at your request and you include it in the header to identify that you’re the request originator.\n\nIf your app implements In-App Purchase and you have an existing API key, you can use it in the requests. Retrieve an existing key ID in [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] on the Users and Access page, from the Keys tab. The page lists any existing key IDs in a column under the Active heading. Hover over a key to reveal a link that copies the ID to the clipboard.\n\nTo create an API key:\n\nYou only have to create an API key once. Use its ID on all of your requests. However, the key information is read only, so if you want to change the key name, for example, you revoke it and generate a new one.\n\n## Create the token header\n\nThe token header is a JSON object that contains the following fields:\n\nHere’s an example of a complete JWT header:\n\n## Create the token payload\n\nThe token payload is a JSON object that contains the following fields:\n\nHere’s an example of a complete JWT payload:\n\n## Sign the token\n\nTo ensure the authenticity of the request, sign the token with your API-key private key using ES256 encryption.

An example call to the API looks like this:\n\n```shell\ncurl -v -H 'Authorization: Bearer [token string]' \n\"https:\/\/api.storekit.itunes.apple.com\/account\/v1\/autoSignIn\/update\"\n```\n\nThe `[token string]` format is JSON Web Token (JWT), which consists of a header and a payload. The information you add in the token primarily provides the web service with:\n\n- A number that App Store Connect issues that identifies your development team\n- The bundle ID of the app that generates the Automatic Sign-In tokens (your media-streaming app)\n- Certification of authenticity by using a cryptographic signature\n\n## Generate an API key or access an existing key\n\nAutomatic Sign-In API relies on the same authentication mechanism as StoreKit, so the web service checks the request header for an identifier of an In-App Purchase API key.

Navigate to the [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] Users and Access page and the Integrations tab.\n2. In the sidebar under Keys, click In-App Purchase.\n3. Click Generate In-App Purchase Key, or the Add (+) icon to add another key.\n4. Enter a name for the key. The name is for your reference on the website only.\n5. Click Generate to finalize creation and see the key ID next to the key’s name on the page.\n\nYou only have to create an API key once. Use its ID on all of your requests.
