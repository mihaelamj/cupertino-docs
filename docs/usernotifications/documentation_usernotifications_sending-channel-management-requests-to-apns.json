  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nBroadcast push notifications use channels to reach a large number of people with Live Activities. To send updates with a Live Activity for an event such a sports game using broadcast push notifications, associate your event with a channel, identified by creating a unique channel ID. Store the association for each Live Activity event with a unique channel ID, and then share the channel ID with the devices. Devices use this channel identifier to subscribe to push notifications for each Live Activity event. Devices on iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 can subscribe to receive updates on channels using [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/activitykit]. For more information on using ActivityKit to subscribe for updates on a channel, refer to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/activitykit\/starting-and-updating-live-activities-with-activitykit-push-notifications].\n\nThe figure below describes how your server communicates with Apple Push Notification service (APNs) when you create a channel. APNs returns a channel ID which your server shares with the people interested in receiving Live Activity updates. The device uses the channel ID to subscribe for broadcast push notifications on the channel.\n\n\n\nThe lifecycles of the channel ID and Live Activity on device are independent. Specifically, a channel ID exists even if there are no active subscribers, or all subscribers remove the Live Activity. In order to support several simultaneous events, you can maintain up to 10,000 channels for your app in the development and production environment, respectively. Once the Live Activity event is complete, and you no longer plan to use the channel for any subsequent updates, delete the channel to avoid going over the allocated channel limit.\n\n### Establish a connection to APNs\n\nUse HTTP\/2 and TLS 1.2 or later to establish a connection between your provider server and one of the following servers.\n\nFor more details on establishing a connection to the APNs server to send requests, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/establishing-a-connection-to-apns].\n\n### Create a channel\n\nTo create a new channel, create and send a POST request to APNs with the appropriate configuration. Channel IDs generate randomly when you create them, and you can’t request a channel with a specific ID.\n\nMessage storage policy configured as part of the request can’t be modified later. The message storage policy of the channel determines if the channel stores deferred messages for offline devices. There are two available options: No Message Storage and Most Recent Message Stored. For activities with frequent updates like sports scores, use No Message Storage, which allows a higher publishing budget. For activities with infrequent updates, such as event tracking and flight updates, use Most Recent Message Stored. Messages in Most Recent Message store for a maximum duration of 8 hours. You can specify an earlier expiration of messages by setting an `apns-expiration` header when you send push notification on the channel.\n\nThe table below describes the HTTP\/2 request fields:\n\nThe table below describes the JSON dictionary request body fields:\n\nThe code snippet below shows a sample to request a channel using a JWT.\n\nThe response to a successful request contains the header fields described below, with the body of the response empty.
