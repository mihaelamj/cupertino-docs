If the user selected one of your app’s custom actions, the `response` parameter contains the identifier for that action. (The response can also indicate that the user dismissed the notification interface, or launched your app, without selecting a custom action.) At the end of your implementation, call the `completionHandler` block to let the system know that you are done processing the user’s response. If you do not implement this method, your app never responds to custom actions.\n\nYou specify your app’s notification types at app launch using [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationCategory] objects, and you specify the custom actions for each type using [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationAction] objects.
