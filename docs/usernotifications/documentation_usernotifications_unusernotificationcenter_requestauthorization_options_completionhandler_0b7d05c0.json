Interactions include displaying an alert, playing a sound, or badging the app’s icon.\n\nThe first time your app calls the method, the system prompts the person to authorize the requested interactions. The person may grant or deny authorization, and the system stores the person’s response. Subsequent calls to this method don’t prompt the person again. After determining the authorization status, the user notification center object executes the block in the `completionHandler` parameter. Use that block to make any adjustments to your app’s behavior. For example, if the person denied authorization, you might notify a remote notification server not to send notifications to the user’s device.\n\nThe person may change the interactions they allow at any time in system settings.
