Users can interact with delivered notifications in many ways. If the notification’s category had associated action buttons, they can select one of those buttons. Users can also dismiss the notification without selecting one of your actions and they can open your app. A response object tells you which option the user selected.\n\nYou don’t create [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationResponse] objects yourself. Instead, the shared user notification center object creates them and delivers them to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate\/userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)] method of its delegate object. Use that method to extract any needed information from the response object and take appropriate action.\n\nFor more information about responding to actions, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/handling-notifications-and-notification-related-actions].",
