If you decide not to modify the content, call the `contentHandler` block with the original content from the `request` parameter.\n\nYou can modify any of the content from the original request. You might customize the content for the current user or replace it altogether. You can use this method to download images or movies and add them as attachments to the content.

If the content object doesn’t contain any alert text, the system ignores your modifications and delivers the original notification content.\n\nYour extension has a limited amount of time (no more than 30 seconds) to modify the content and execute the `contentHandler` block. If you don’t execute that block in a timely manner, the system calls your extension’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationServiceExtension\/serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire()] method to give you one last chance to execute the block.
