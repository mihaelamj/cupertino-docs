  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nRemote notifications convey important information to the user in the form of a JSON payload. The payload specifies the types of user interactions (alert, sound, or badge) that you want performed, and includes any custom data your app needs to respond to the notification.\n\n\n\nA basic remote notification payload includes Apple-defined keys and their custom values. You may also add custom keys and values specific to your notifications. Apple Push Notification service (APNs) refuses a notification if the total size of its payload exceeds the following limits:\n\n### Create the JSON payload\n\nSpecify the payload for a remote notification using a JSON dictionary. Inside this dictionary, include an `aps` key whose value is a dictionary containing one or more additional Apple-defined keys, listed in Table 1. You can include keys instructing the system to display an alert, play a sound, or badge your app’s icon. You can also instruct the system to handle the notification silently in the background. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/pushing-background-updates-to-your-app].\n\nIn addition to the Apple-defined keys, you may add custom keys to your payload to deliver small amounts of data to your app, notification service app extension, or notification content app extension. Your custom keys must have values with primitive types, such as dictionary, array, string, number, or Boolean. Custom keys are available in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationContent\/userInfo] dictionary of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationContent] object delivered to your app.\n\nTypically, you use custom keys to help your code process the notification. For example, you might include an identifier string that your code can use to look up app-specific data. Add app-specific keys as peers of the `aps` dictionary.\n\nListing 1 shows a notification payload that displays an alert message inviting the user to play a game. If the `category` key identifies a previously registered [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationCategory] object, the system adds action buttons to the alert. For example, the category here includes a play action to start the game immediately. The custom `gameID` key contains an identifier that the app can use to retrieve the game invitation.\n\nListing 1. A remote notification payload for showing an alert\n\nListing 2 shows a notification payload that badges the app’s icon and plays a sound. The specified sound file must be on the user’s device already, either in the app’s bundle or in the `Library\/Sounds` folder of the app’s container. The `messageID` key contains app-specific information for identifying the message that caused the notification.\n\nListing 2. A remote notification payload for playing a sound\n\nFor more information about creating sounds for your notifications, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/UNNotificationSound].\n\n### Localize your alert messages\n\nThere are two ways to localize the content of remote notifications:\n\nPlacing localized strings directly into the payload gives you more flexibility, but requires you to track the user’s preferred language on your provider server. Because your provider server supplies the strings, it must know which language to use. On the user’s device, you can retrieve the user’s preferred languages by examining the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSLocale\/preferredLanguages] property of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSLocale]. Your app can then forward that information to your server.\n\nIf the text of your notification messages is predetermined, you can store your message strings in the `Localizable.strings` file of your app bundle and use the `title-loc-key`, `subtitle-loc-key`, and `loc-key` payload keys to specify which strings you want to display. Your localized strings may contain placeholders so that you can insert content dynamically into the final string. Listing 3 shows an example of a payload with a message derived from an app-provided string. The `loc-args` key contains an array of replacement variables to substitute into the string.\n\nListing 3. A remote notification payload with localized content\n\nFor more information about the keys you use for localized content, see Table 2.\n\n### Payload key reference\n\nTable 1 lists the keys that you may include in the `aps` dictionary. To interact with the user, include the `alert`, `badge`, or `sound` keys. Don’t add your own custom keys to the `aps` dictionary; APNs ignores custom keys. Instead, add your custom keys as peers of the `aps` dictionary, as shown in Listing 1.\n\nTable 1. Keys to include in the `aps` dictionary\n\nTable 2 lists the keys that you may include in the `alert` dictionary. Use these strings to specify the title and message to include in the alert banner.\n\nTable 2. Keys to include in the `alert` dictionary\n\nTable 3 lists the keys that you may include in the `sound` dictionary. Use these keys to configure the sound for a critical alert.\n\nTable 3. Keys to include in the `sound` dictionary\n\nThe figure below shows the default placement of the `title`, `subtitle`, and `body` content in a banner notification. To customize the appearance of alerts, use a notification content app extension as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotificationsUI\/customizing-the-appearance-of-notifications].\n\n",
