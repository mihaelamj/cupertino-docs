You decide which notifications you want to send to your users, and when to send them. When it’s time to send a notification, you generate a request that contains the notification data and a unique identifier for the user’s device. You then forward your request to APNs, which handles the delivery of the notification to the user’s device.

How you implement these tasks depends on your infrastructure. Use the technologies that are appropriate for your company:\n\n- Write code to receive device tokens from instances of your app running on user devices, and to associate those tokens with your users’ accounts. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/registering-your-app-with-apns].\n- Determine when to send notifications to your users, and write code to generate notification payloads. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/generating-a-remote-notification].\n- Manage a connection to APNs using HTTP\/2 and TLS. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/sending-notification-requests-to-apns].\n- Write code to generate POST requests that contain your payloads, and send those requests over your HTTP\/2 connection. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/sending-notification-requests-to-apns].\n- Regenerate your token periodically for token-based authentication. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/establishing-a-token-based-connection-to-apns].\n\n### Establish a trusted connection to APNs\n\nCommunication between your provider server and APNs must take place over a secure connection.

APNs then forwards the stored notifications when the device comes online.\n- If APNs doesn’t deliver a notification immediately, either for device power considerations or because the destination is offline, it may coalesce notifications for the same bundle ID.\n\n## Server tasks\n\n- **Registering your app with APNs**: Communicate with Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and receive a unique device token that identifies your app.\n- **Generating a remote notification**: Send notifications to the user’s device with a JSON payload.\n- **Pushing background updates to your App**: Deliver notifications that wake your app and update it in the background.\n- **Establishing a connection to Apple Push Notification service (APNs)**: Secure your communications with APNs to send API requests.\n\n## Security\n\n- **Establishing a token-based connection to APNs**: Secure your communications with Apple Push Notification service (APNs) by using stateless authentication tokens.\n- **Establishing a certificate-based connection to APNs**: Secure your communications with Apple Push Notification service (APNs) by installing a certificate on your provider server.\n\n## Device push notifications\n\n- **Sending notification requests to APNs**: Transmit your remote notification payload and device token information to Apple Push Notification service (APNs).\n- **Handling notification responses from APNs**: Respond to the status codes that the APNs servers return.\n- **Viewing the status of push notifications using Metrics and APNs**: Monitor and interpret the status of your push notifications with Apple Push Notification service (APNs).\n\n## Broadcast push notifications\n\n- **Setting up broadcast push notifications**: Enable broadcast capability for Apple Push Notifications service (APNs).\n- **Sending channel management requests to APNs**: Manage channels that your application uses for broadcast push notifications.\n- **Sending broadcast push notification requests to APNs**: Transmit your broadcast notification payload to Apple Push Notifications service (APNs).\n- **Handling error responses from Apple Push Notification service**: Respond to the status codes returned by APNs servers.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Troubleshooting push notifications**: Debug your server to send push notifications with device and broadcast push notifications.\n\n## Remote notifications\n\n- **Sending push notifications using command-line tools**: Use basic macOS command-line tools to send push notifications to Apple Push Notification service (APNs).\n- **Testing notifications using the Push Notification Console**: Send test notifications and access delivery logs to test your app’s integration with Apple Push Notification service (APNs).\n\n",
