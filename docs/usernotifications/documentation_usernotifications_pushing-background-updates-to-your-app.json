  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf your app’s server-based content changes infrequently or at irregular intervals, you can use *background notifications* to notify your app when new content becomes available. A background notification is a remote notification that doesn’t display an alert, play a sound, or badge your app’s icon. It wakes your app in the background and gives it time to initiate downloads from your server and update its content.\n\n### Enable the remote notifications capability\n\nTo receive background notifications, you must add the remote notifications background mode to your app. In the Signing and Capability tab, add the Background Modes capability, then select the Remote notification checkbox. The figure below shows what you must select to recieve background notifications.\n\n\n\nFor watchOS, add this capability to your WatchKit Extension.\n\n### Create a background notification\n\nTo send a background notification, create a remote notification with an `aps` dictionary that includes only the `content-available` key, as shown in the sample code below. You may include custom keys in the payload, but the `aps` dictionary must not contain any keys that would trigger user interactions.\n\nAdditionally, the notification’s POST request should contain the `apns-push-type` header field with a value of `background`, and the `apns-priority` field with a value of `5`. The APNs server requires the `apns-push-type` field when sending push notifications to Apple Watch, and recommends it for all platforms. For more information, see Create a POST request to APNs in [doc:\/\/com.apple.usernotifications\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/sending-notification-requests-to-apns].\n\n### Receive background notifications\n\nWhen a device receives a background notification, the system may hold and delay the delivery of the notification, which can have the following side effects:\n\nTo deliver a background notification, the system wakes your app in the background. On iOS it then calls your app delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:)] method. On watchOS, it calls your extension delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WatchKit\/WKExtensionDelegate\/didReceiveRemoteNotification(_:fetchCompletionHandler:)] method. Your app has 30 seconds to perform any tasks and call the provided completion handler.
