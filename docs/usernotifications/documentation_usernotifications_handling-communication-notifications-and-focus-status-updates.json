  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nCommunication notifications have a distinct user experience that features prominent avatars and group names, as well as unique breakthrough behaviors. Implement these notifications for incoming calls and messages to provide additional context to the user.\n\n### Configure the Sample Code Project\n\nThis sample runs on physical devices in order to meet requirements for push notifications and the Notification Service Extension. The Notification Service Extension modifies a notification’s content before it’s displayed on the user’s device. To learn more about Notification Service Extensions, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/modifying-content-in-newly-delivered-notifications].\n\nBegin by configuring the iOS target to include your development team and a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/resources\/identifiers\/bundleId\/]. The bundle identifier must support the following capabilities:\n\nTo support communication notifications, the app’s `Info.plist` file must contain a top-level entry with the key [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSUserActivityTypes] and type `Array`. This array should contain `INStartCallIntent` if the app supports calling functionality, and `INSendMessageIntent` if it supports messaging.\n\nAccessing a user’s Focus status requires their authorization. To let the user know how the app uses their Focus status, include a usage description string. Provide this usage description string as a value for the `Privacy - Focus Status Usage Description` key in the app’s `Info.plist` file.\n\n### Donate Intent Interactions\n\nDonate an intent interaction for each communication that takes place in the app. The app should donate both outgoing and incoming communication interactions. Donate incoming interactions to update communication notifications and enable their unique user experience and breakthrough behavior. Donate outgoing interactions when the current user sends messages or initiates calls. This allows the system to make better suggestions and provide communication notification functionality.\n\nThe sample initializes interactions in `CommunicationMapper.ineraction(communicationInformation:)` and donates them in the `suggest(communicationInformation:completion:)` method. The provided communication information determines the interaction’s direction.\n\n### Update Notification Content\n\nTo display a communication notification, your app should update the notification’s content. This allows the notification to break through scheduled notification summaries. It’s also possible for communication notifications to break through an enabled Focus when the Allowed People list contains the sender. Use the same intent object that initialized the `incoming` interaction. Wait for the interaction donation to complete before updating notification content.\n\nThe sample updates notification content in the Notification Service Extension by calling `CommunicationInteractor.update(notificationContent:communicationInformation:completion:)`.\n\n### Request Focus Status\n\nWhen a user has enabled a Focus, it may be useful to display that status to other users of an app. This informs other users when someone silences their notifications and may not see communications right away.\n\nAccessing the user’s Focus status requires explicit user authorization. To request authorization, use `INFocusStatusCenter.default.requestAuthorization(completionHandler:)` and parse the result. Someone can choose to authorize the app to access their Focus status, deny the app access, or choose neither.\n\nOnce authorized, an app can request the user’s current Focus status. The perspective of the app is important; the user doesn’t appear focused to an app if an enabled Focus allows notifications from that app.\n\nThe sample accesses the current Focus status in the `requestFocusStatus(completion:)` method. Unauthorized apps don’t receive a Focus status value. Ensure the app handles the `nil` Focus status case.\n\nObserve Focus status changes from an Intents app extension. This extension launches in the background to handle interactions between your app and SiriKit. To learn more about Intents app extensions, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SiriKit\/creating-an-intents-app-extension]. Ensure your Intents app extension target includes support for [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Intents\/INShareFocusStatusIntent]. The Intents app extension target’s General tab in the project file contains the list of supported intents. Include the class names of all supported intents in the Supported Intents section.\n\nThe Intents app extension in the sample handles incoming [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Intents\/INShareFocusStatusIntent] objects. When doing so, the sample uses the intent itself to access the `isFocused` bool directly instead of using the default `INFocusStatusCenter`.",
