The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 16.2, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 16.2, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-16_2-release-notes].\n\n### Accelerate\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Resolved an issue impacting the accuracy of some linear algebra operations (*lartg). These functions have been restored to their 3.9.1 implementation.  (139760965) (FB15782411)\n\n### ActivityKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Resolved an issue where iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Silicon Macs quit unexpectedly if ActivityKit is linked.  (100240357)\n\n### Authentication Services\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Silicon Macs might quit unexpectedly if `-[ASAuthorizationController performAutoFillAssistedRequests]` is invoked.  (128153762)\n\n### ChatGPT Integration\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: For devices with MDM profiles, users with anonymous restrictions are unable to sign out.  (135440023)\n- Fixed: Image and Document Q&A requests to ChatGPT via Siri might fail if the query doesn’t specify “photo” or “document”.  (138352105)\n\n### Kernel\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Resolved an issue where running Ruby with YJIT enabled causes Mac with M4 chip to kernel panic.  (139714575) (FB15774033)\n\n### NSWritingToolsCoordinator\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` ignores the returned attributed string from `writingToolsCoordinator(_:replaceRange:inContext:proposedText:reason:animationParameters:completion:)`.  (139210266)\n- Resolved an issue to properly name `NSWritingToolsCoordinator`-related enums inside an `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` extension in Swift-style: `TextUpdateReason`, `State`, `TextReplacementReason`, `ContextScope`, and `TextAnimation`.  (139356801)\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- `NSWritingToolsCoordinator` only supports synchronous `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` interfaces, expecting the completion handler to be invoked without escaping the delegate methods.  (136769777)\n- The object does not support multiple `NSWritingToolsCoordinatorContext` elements, and supports only the first element used. Also, it does not support dynamic `decorationContainerView`. The two optional `NSWritingToolsCoordinator.Delegate` methods for multiple container support are never called.  (137983691)\n\n### ScreenCaptureKit\n\n#### New Features\n\n- ScreenCaptureKit is available for Catalyst applications. Developers must use the macOS 15.2 SDK or later.  (104444076) (FB11957714)\n- The system picking experience now surfaces additional metadata for user selected content, including details on the display, application, and window.  (133085308) (FB14629093)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### New Features\n\n- For macOS apps linked against macOS 15.2 SDK, the `onScrollGeometryChange(for:of:action:)` modifier can be used with `List` to post geometry changes for the List-owned scroll view.  (118852752)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Compiling in the Swift 6 language mode might cause an `@Entry` error due to “static property `defaultValue` is not concurrency-safe because non-‘Sendable’ type”.  (133885814)\n- Resolved an issue to improve performance and CPU usage when scrolling `ScrollView`s and `List`s.  (137546908)\n- Fixed: Views won’t accept dropped directories if [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/uniformtypeidentifiers\/uttype-swift.struct\/directory] or [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/uniformtypeidentifiers\/uttype-swift.struct\/fileurl] are not in the list of accepted content types for drop.  (138158126)\n\n### Virtualization\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Installation of macOS Sequoia 15.2 Beta in VMs is not available.  (137528160)\n- Fixed: Resolved an issue where macOS VM guest running macOS 13.3.1 or earlier fails to boot on a host Mac with M4 chip.  (139615567)\n\n### WidgetKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Silicon Macs quit unexpectedly if Live Activities API in WidgetKit are linked.  (107876557)\n\n## macOS 15\n\n- **macOS Sequoia 15.6 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Sequoia 15.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Sequoia 15.4 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Sequoia 15.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Sequoia 15.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Sequoia 15 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
