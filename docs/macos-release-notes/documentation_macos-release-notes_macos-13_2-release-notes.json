The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.2, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.2, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-14_2-release-notes].\n\n### ServiceManagement\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a regression in Ventura 13.1 that prevented daemons from being registered with SMAppService. Also fixed, toggling items on or off in Login Items may cause items to be ungrouped or deleted. (102938063)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### New Feature\n\n- Applications written using Swift App Lifecycle can now support scriptable application properties and elements.  Use `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` to bridge to your custom application delegate, then implement `application(_:delegateHandlesKey:)` and the necessary KVC accessors as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/NSApplicationDelegate\/application(_:delegateHandlesKey:)] and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/ScriptableCocoaApplications\/SApps_implement\/SAppsImplement.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/20000037-BBCJEEEC].
