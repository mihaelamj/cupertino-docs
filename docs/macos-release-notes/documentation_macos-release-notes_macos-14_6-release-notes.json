The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 15.4, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 15.4, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-15_4-release-notes].\n\n### ARKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Silicon Macs quit unexpectedly when initializing `ARSkeletonDefinition`.  (128038936)\n\n### Core Spotlight\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Silicon Macs quit unexpectedly when invoking `-[CSSearchableItemAttributeSet setActionIdentifiers:]`.  (128039095)\n\n### Finder\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Home Videos unexpectedly sync as Music Videos to iPod nano (7th generation).  (94899119)\n\n### Video Subscriber Account\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: iPhone and iPad apps on Apple Silicon Macs quit unexpectedly if `VSOpenTVProviderSettingsURLString` is referenced.  (113562872)\n\n### Video Toolbox\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue and now on Apple Silicon, if width or height is greater than 4096 columns or rows and content uses 4:2:0 chroma subsampling and 8-bit depth, the hardware decoder driver will reject it and a software decoder will be automatically selected to ensure artifact-free decoding. AVC (H.264) content at level 5.2 or lower can be handled by the hardware decoder. Content that otherwise conforms to level 5.2 but is high frame rate (e.g. 4k at 100 or 120 fps) is labelled level 6, 6.1 or 6.2 and is also handled by hardware. If content is 10-bit, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4, the hardware decoder will be used.
