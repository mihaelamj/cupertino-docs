The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 12.5, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 12.5, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-12_5-release-notes].\n\n### Displays\n\n#### New Features\n\n- You can now use graphics cards based on the AMD Navi RDNA2 architecture (6800, 6800XT and 6900XT). (73709953)\n\n### Xcode\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- Don’t use the iOS [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/MinimumOSVersion] information property list key to declare the minimum release of macOS in which your app runs. Use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/LSMinimumSystemVersion] instead. (73890473)\n\n- Future releases of macOS ignore the `MinimumOSVersion` key in Mac apps, including apps built with Mac Catalyst.\n- Future releases of macOS use the `LSMinimumSystemVersion` key in iOS apps built with Xcode 12.5 or later. If an iOS app doesn’t include an `LSMinimumSystemVersion` key, future releases of macOS compare the app’s `MinimumOSVersion` with the version of its Mac Catalyst runtime to determine compatibility.\n\n## macOS 11\n\n- **macOS Big Sur 11.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Big Sur 11.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Big Sur 11.2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Big Sur 11.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 Universal Apps Release Notes**: Update your apps to support Macs with Apple silicon.\n- **macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 iOS & iPadOS Apps on Mac Release Notes**: Considerations for running iPhone and iPad apps on Macs with Apple silicon.\n\n",
