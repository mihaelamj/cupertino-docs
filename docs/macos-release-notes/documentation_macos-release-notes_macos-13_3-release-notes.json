The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.3, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.3, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-14_3-release-notes].\n\n### Accelerate\n\n#### New Features\n\n- The BLAS and LAPACK libraries under the Accelerate framework are now inline with reference version 3.9.1. These new interfaces provide additional functionality and a new ILP64 interface. To use the new interfaces, define `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK` before including the Accelerate or vecLib headers. For ILP64 interfaces, also define `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64`. For Swift projects, specify `ACCELERATE_NEW_LAPACK=1` and `ACCELERATE_LAPACK_ILP64=1` as preprocessor macros in Xcode build settings. (105572917)\n\n### Accessory Security\n\n#### New Features\n\n- On Apple silicon portables, SD or SD extended capacity cards require user approval before the card can communicate with macOS. (102838867)\n\n### Core ML\n\n#### Deprecations\n\n- Core ML Model Deployment is being deprecated. Consider using Background Assets or `NSURLSession` instead. (102993813)\n\n### iCloud Settings\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- You might be unable to enter the upgrade page for iCloud+ from iCloud Settings. (104629261)\n\n**Workaround:** Click “Upgrade to iCloud+” from [https:\/\/www.apple.com\/icloud\/] to trigger the upgrade page.\n- Some apps which previously displayed sync toggles in iCloud Drive Settings aren’t currently displayed. (105239897)\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- macOS Ventura 13.3 beta installer fails when upgrading from versions prior to macOS Big Sur. (106102320)\n\n**Workaround:** Upgrade to macOS Ventura 13.2.1 before upgrading to macOS Ventura 13.3.\n\n### Metal\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/metal\/mtlaccelerationstructurecommandencoder?language=objc] now supports `nil` for a refit scratch buffer if the required size of the buffer is zero bytes. (103192673)\n\n### Pages, Numbers, and Keynote\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- When Advanced Data Protection for iCloud is turned on, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote might unexpectedly require collaborative documents to be closed. (103463223)\n\n**Workaround:** Close the affected document, spreadsheet, or presentation and reopen it after a few minutes.\n\n### Safari Web Extensions\n\n#### New Features\n\n- Added support for `modifyHeaders` action type for `declarativeNetRequest` rules. (71867709)\n- Added support for `browser.storage.session` to store up to 10MB of data in-memory. (79283961)\n- Added support for persistent content scripts via `browser.scripting.registerContentScript`, `browser.scripting.getRegisteredContentScripts`, `browser.scripting.unregisterContentScripts`, and `scripting.updateContentScripts`. (91261369)\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed `browser.webNavigation` events firing for hosts where the extension didn’t have access. Extensions should request host permissions for sites to receive events. (100204850)\n\n### StoreKit\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue causing iOS apps on Mac to fail while purchasing or restoring in-app content. (102123618)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a regression where the `truncationMode` view modifier didn’t truncate `TextField` on macOS. (53647517)\n- Fixed: Dragging an `Image` using `draggable` modifier no longer causes an app to freeze. (99157719)\n- Fixed: An App defined with a `Window` scene will no longer cause the window tabbing menu items to be displayed, nor will it participate in any window tabbing behavior. (100982500)\n- Fixed: Presentations in SwiftUI using the ‘sheet’ or ‘fullScreenCover’ modifier can now be dynamically presented again while a dismiss animation is in progress. Previously, attempting to present again in this case would do nothing.\n\nNote: A data race in app code that was previously ignored might cause a sheet to be presented again with this change. If this happens, check that your state isn’t triggering a new presentation. (101487810)\n- Fixed an issue on macOS where columns in `Table` might not be able to be resized. (101936572)\n- Fixed: When used as an auxiliary scene in a SwiftUI App, the `Window` scene will now behave as an auxiliary window with respect to Stage Manager and full screen mode. (102106455)\n- Fixed: `List` in `.sidebar` style now supports swipe actions. (103910772)\n- Fixed: `List` with `DisclosureGroup` now supports expand\/collapse animations when `isExpanded` is set within a `withAnimation` block. (104923100)\n- Fixed: `Table` on macOS will now properly respond to `scrollTo` requests with dynamcially added rows as target IDs. (105579236)\n\n### SwiftUI Navigation\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `.navigationSplitViewColumn` and `.layoutPriority` now control the widths of columns of a `NavigationSplitView` on macOS. Use the existing `.windowResizability(.contentSize)` scene modifier if needed to control the window’s size based off a root `NavigationSplitView`.\n\n```\nstruct MeasuredNavigationSplit: View {\n   var body: some View {\n      NavigationSplitView {\n          Color.cyan\n              .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min: 90, ideal: 100, max: 300)\n              .layoutPriority(2)\n       } content: {\n          Color.pink\n              .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(ideal: 300, max: 400)\n              .layoutPriority(3)\n       } detail: {\n          Color.yellow\n              .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min: 200, ideal: 300)\n              .layoutPriority(2)\n       }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n(58333786)\n- Fixed: Navigation destinations nested within `NavigationStack` and `NavigationSplitView` are detected more performantly and reliably, no longer logging update cycles. (97597634)\n- Fixed: Navigation destinations that present a new view on top of a `NavigationSplitViewColumn` (rather than pushing a view onto a stack in that column) no longer cause an assertion failure on iOS or infinite loop on macOS when the destination view is itself a `NavigationStack`.\n\nFor example, the below construction is functional\n\n```swift\nNavigationSplitView { \n    SidebarView()\n    .navigationDestination(isPresented: $present) {\n        NavigationStack { ... }\n    }\n} detail: { ... }\n```\n\n(103278180)\n- Fixed: Navigation destinations with data dependencies captured from ancestor views update more reliably.\n\n```swift\nstruct DataDependentNavigation: View {\n  @State var changeColor: Bool = false\n  @State var present: Bool = false\n\n  var body: some View {\n  NavigationSplitView {\n    Color.blue\n      .navigationDestination(isPresented: $present) {\n           \/\/ This is a data dependency from an ancestor view\n            changeColor ? Color.green : Color.yellow\n      }\n  } detail: {\n    Color.teal\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(103429535)\n\n### Task Manager\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue introduced in macOS Ventura 13.1 that caused the system to post excessive “Background Items Added” notifications after toggling items in System Settings > General > Login Items. Toggling items in macOS Ventura 13.2 doesn’t cause excessive notifications, but that release doesn’t automatically correct the issue inherited from macOS Ventura 13.1. (102352141)\n\n### Virtualization\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Installing macOS Ventura 13.3 beta on a virtual machine running on a Apple silicon Mac might result in a hang during setup.
