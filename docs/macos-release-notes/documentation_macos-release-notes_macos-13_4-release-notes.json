The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 14.3, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 14.3, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-14_3-release-notes].\n\n### Apple Studio Display\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- Apple Studio Display firmware update starts showing progress but never completes. (107287354)\n\n**Workaround:** To install other updates including future macOS Beta Updates, click “More info…” in Software Update Settings, uncheck Apple Studio Display firmware update, and click “Install Now.”\n\n### CSS\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed increasing `column-count` above 2 not updating the layout. (71808738)\n\n### File Bookmark\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed a regression in macOS Ventura 13.3 where a security check causes bookmark resolution to fail when the path contains Unicode characters stored with composed normalization. As an example, this prevented files in Finder from opening when double-clicked. (107550080)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: Using `ImageRenderer` within a `ShareLink`’s `preview` closure crashed the running application. (107763234)\n\n## macOS 13\n\n- **macOS Ventura 13.5 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Ventura 13.3 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Ventura 13.2 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Ventura 13.1 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n- **macOS Ventura 13 Release Notes**: Update your apps to use new features, and test your apps against API changes.\n\n",
