The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 26.1, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 26.1, see [\/documentation\/Xcode-Release-Notes\/xcode-26_1-release-notes].\n\n### Apple TV app\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: In Apple TV app on macOS, the Search bar is missing.   (159419539)\n\n### Background Assets\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: `AssetPackManager.url(for:)` unexpectedly throws an error when looking up the URL for a locally available asset file.  (157959878) (FB19512759)\n\n### Game Controller\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The time returned by `GCPressedStateInput.lastPressedStateTimestamp` is not in the correct time domain.  (159124910)\n- Fixed: Game controller input might be delayed when many tasks are submitted to the default global concurrent queue.  (159163570)\n- Fixed: Non-UI processes might not receive game controller input after setting `GCController. shouldMonitorBackgroundEvents` to `true`.  (160974748) (FB20307654)\n\n### sudo\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: There are now added security checks when loading the `\/etc\/sudoers` configuration and `\/etc\/sudoers.d` folder. When the owner is not set to `root`, the configuration is ignored and sudo might not work.  (155330149) (FB18698477)\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n#### Resolved Issues\n\n- Fixed: The `navigationLinkIndicatorVisibility` modifier crashes when run on iOS 17, iOS 18 and aligned releases.\n\nYou must recompile your app against the 26.1 SDK to receive this fix.  (158236264) (FB19613386)\n\n### Virtualization\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The serial number published for the virtual machine is 0, which prevents iCloud and related applications from functioning correctly.
