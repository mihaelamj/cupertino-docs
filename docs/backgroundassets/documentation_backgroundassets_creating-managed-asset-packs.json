Then Managed Background Assets can automatically manage downloads, updates, compression, and more for your assets.\n\nIf you use Apple-Hosted Background Assets, you upload the asset packs to App Store Connect and update them there along with your app builds. Apple-Hosted Background Assets can host up to 200GB of compressed assets and is available for apps distributed through the App Store on all platforms except watchOS.\n\nTo add an Apple-Hosted Background Assets downloader extension to your app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.backgroundassets\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/downloading-apple-hosted-asset-packs]. To test your asset packs before uploading them to App Store Connect, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.backgroundassets\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/testing-asset-packs-locally].\n\n### Identify asset packs and choose download policies\n\nGroup assets that you want to download together into asset packs. For example, create an asset pack that contains the textures, sound effects, and GPU shaders for a tutorial in your game. You can also include CPU and GPU executables in an asset pack, but not macOS executables.\n\nDecide on a download policy for each asset pack, which the system uses to manage the assets on a device:\n\nFor example, choose `essential` for the tutorial asset pack so that people can run the tutorial immediately after installing your game without delay.\n\nFor limits on asset packs hosted by Apple, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/reference\/apple-hosted-asset-pack-size-limits] in App Store Connect Help.\n\n### Create a manifest file\n\nAdd a manifest file to your asset pack that specifies a download policy and other details. Create a JSON manifest file that contains information about your asset pack. After you install Xcode, run this `xcrun` command in Terminal to generate a manifest template:\n\nThen, enter the information about your asset pack in the manifest file following the instructions in the comments:\n\nThis example shows a manifest file for downloading assets for a game’s tutorial. The first time  people install this game, the system downloads the tutorial’s assets, and later, when people update the game, the system doesn’t download the tutorial’s assets again.\n\n### Archive asset packs\n\nNext, use the packaging tool command to compress the assets, along with the manifest file, into an archive. Set the current directory in Terminal to the root of your source repository and pass the manifest file to the packaging tool command:\n\n### Manage asset packs in App Store Connect\n\nFor Apple-hosted asset packs, upload your asset packs — independent of your app builds — to App Store Connect using the  [https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/transporter\/id1450874784] app, the `altool` command-line tool, iTMSTransporter, or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI].

Create a JSON manifest file that contains information about your asset pack. After you install Xcode, run this `xcrun` command in Terminal to generate a manifest template:\n\n```sh\nxcrun ba-package template -o Manifest.json\n```\n\nThen, enter the information about your asset pack in the manifest file following the instructions in the comments:\n\n1. Set the `assetPackID` key to an identifier that you use in your code to access the asset pack.\n2. Set the `downloadPolicy` key to an object with a single key that’s either `essential`, `prefetch`, or `onDemand`.\n\n- For `essential` and `prefetch`, set the nested `installationEventTypes` key to an array of `firstInstallation`, `subsequentUpdate`, or both.\n- For `onDemand`, leave the value as an empty object.\n3. Add the paths to the files and folders that you want to include in the asset pack as file-selector objects in the `fileSelectors` array. Use the `file` key for individual assets and the `directory` key for folders that contain assets. All nested folders are also included.\n4. Specify the platforms on which you want to make the asset pack available in the `platforms` array.\n\n\n\nThis example shows a manifest file for downloading assets for a game’s tutorial. The first time  people install this game, the system downloads the tutorial’s assets, and later, when people update the game, the system doesn’t download the tutorial’s assets again.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"assetPackID\": \"Tutorial\",\n    \"downloadPolicy\": {\n        \"essential\": {\n            \"installationEventTypes\": [\n                \"firstInstallation\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"fileSelectors\": [\n        {\n            \"file\": \"Videos\/Introduction.m4v\"\n        },\n        \/\/ …\n    ],\n    \"platforms\": [ \/* … *\/ ]\n}\n```\n\n### Archive asset packs\n\nNext, use the packaging tool command to compress the assets, along with the manifest file, into an archive. Set the current directory in Terminal to the root of your source repository and pass the manifest file to the packaging tool command:\n\n```sh\ncd ~\/Documents\/The\\ Coast\/\nxcrun ba-package Manifest.json -o Tutorial.aar\n```\n\n### Manage asset packs in App Store Connect\n\nFor Apple-hosted asset packs, upload your asset packs — independent of your app builds — to App Store Connect using the  [https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/transporter\/id1450874784] app, the `altool` command-line tool, iTMSTransporter, or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppStoreConnectAPI].
