The sequence of events is:\n\n1. A person installs or updates your app on the device.\n2. The system prevents the app from launching and begins downloading your manifest file using the URL you provide.\n3. During the manifest download, the system reports progress to the App Store.\n4. When the download completes, the system launches your app extension, sending it a content request with the location of the manifest file on disk.\n5. The extension uses the manifest file, which should contains the asset URLs and file sizes, to return a set of download requests to the system.\n6. The system pauses, or terminates, the extension and begins the downloads.\n7. When the downloads complete, the system notifies the extension and allows the app to launch.\n\nThe flow for periodic content requests is identical to the app install and updates, except the system determines when periodic events occur, depending on a person’s usage and their system settings.
