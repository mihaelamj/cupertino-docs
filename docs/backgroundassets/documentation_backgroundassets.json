For example, a game might specify that the system downloads tutorial assets before first launch and other assets on demand — such as level packs, 3D character models, and textures — as a player progresses during gameplay. The default implementation of Managed Background Assets handles downloads, updates, compression, and more for you. If you choose Apple-Hosted Background Assets, you upload your assets to App Store Connect and maintain them there, similar to app builds.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use these features:\n\n1. Group your assets into asset packs containing manifest files that specify a download policy and other details. You can specify that the system downloads essential asset packs before launch, prefetches others without blocking launch, and downloads some only on demand when you need them. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.backgroundassets\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/creating-managed-asset-packs].\n2. Add a managed Background Download extension to your project and configure your project accordingly. Optionally, customize your downloader extension and add code to your app that downloads on-demand assets when needed. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.backgroundassets\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/downloading-apple-hosted-asset-packs].\n3. For either Apple-hosted or self-hosted asset packs, before you distribute your app, test your code using a local mock serve included in your Xcode install. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.backgroundassets\/documentation\/BackgroundAssets\/testing-asset-packs-locally].\n4. For Apple-hosted assets, upload your asset packs to App Store Connect before you distribute your app through TestFlight or the App Store. For more information, see the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-asset-packs\/overview-of-apple-hosted-asset-packs] in App Store Connect Help.\n\nAlternatively, you can manage and host asset downloads yourself using the low-level Background Assets APIs.
