This feedback can give you an important perspective on how your app functions in real-world-scenarios, and help you iterate on features, improve your UI, and address issues.\n\nYou can view people’s feedback in Xcode‘s Feedback organizer and on your app’s TestFlight page in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store-connect\/]. The Feedback organizer provides the ability to respond to the tester, share the feedback among your development team, take notes as you work on issues, and mark items as you resolve them.\n\nFor more information about distributing a beta version of your app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases].\n\n### View feedback from testers\n\nTo view feedback from your app’s testers:\n\nXcode shows the list of available apps organized by platform. The feedback for the selected app appears in a grid. To focus on specific reports, use the filter bar at the top of the window to filter by kind, app version and build, type, and run destination.\n\nThe items in the grid show previews of feedback, including screenshots when available, and a summary of the feedback text. An inspector to the right of the grid shows the details for the selected report.\n\n\n\nDouble-click a preview to display the report’s complete text and larger versions of any attached screenshots.\n\n### Follow up and track progress\n\nTo follow up with a tester who provides feedback, click the email button at the top of the inspector.\n\nTo share a link to a report with another member of your development team, select the item you want to share from the grid and click the Share button at the trailing edge of the window‘s toobar. If the team member has the necessary authorization, they can click the shared link to open the Feedback organizer in Xcode with the preview of the report.\n\nTo rename reports to help keep them organized and to add notes, use the controls at the bottom of the inspector. Use the Mark as Resolved button in the inspector, or the checkbox next to each preview, to keep track of issues as you resolve them.\n\n",
