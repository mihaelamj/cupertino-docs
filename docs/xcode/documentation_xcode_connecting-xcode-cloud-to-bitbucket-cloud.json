It uses this access to automatically build and test your code when you make changes to the codebase.\n\nThe person who first configures a project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud must have the *administrator* permission for the repository on Bitbucket Cloud.

Configure your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud and create your first workflow as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Your-First-Xcode-Cloud-Workflow]. Xcode analyzes your project to learn which SCM provider you use and then indicates that you use Bitbucket Cloud on the Grant Access to Your Source Code sheet.\n2. Click Grant Access. Xcode opens your browser and takes you to the [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] website.\n3. Click “Complete Step 1 in Bitbucket” to connect Xcode Cloud with your Bitbucket account. This takes you to your account on the Bitbucket Cloud website.\n4. Review the permissions Xcode Cloud requests and allow it to access your repository. This takes you back to the App Store Connect website, which indicates that you successfully connected Xcode Cloud to Bitbucket Cloud.\n5. Return to Xcode. It indicates that Xcode Cloud can access your source code.\n6. Click Next, complete the configuration of your first workflow, and start your first build.\n\n## Bitbucket Cloud and Bitbucket Server\n\n- **Connecting Xcode Cloud to Bitbucket Server**: Allow Xcode Cloud to access your Bitbucket Server repository.\n\n",
