You can double-click a resource row to further inspect that resource.\n\n\n\nFor a render pass, the Bound Resources viewer groups the resources in the following sections:\n\n- **Render Pipeline:** The specified render pipeline state.\n- **Execute Indirect:** The indirect command buffer (ICB) that the command executes from.\n- **Vertex\/Object\/Mesh\/Tile\/Fragment Stage:** The resources in the corresponding stage. In addition, it includes the shader function. For the vertex and the mesh stage, it also includes the index buffer and output geometry.\n- **Attachments:** The attachment textures.\n- **Indirect:** The used indirect resources and those from the same heap. To use a resource, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderCommandEncoder\/useResource(_:usage:stages:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLRenderCommandEncoder\/useHeap(_:stages:)].\n\nFor a compute pass, the Bound Resources viewer groups the resources in the following sections:\n\n- **Compute Pipeline:** The specified compute pipeline state.\n- **Execute Indirect:** The indirect command buffer (ICB) that the command executes from.\n- **Compute:** The resources in the compute pass.\n- **Indirect:** The used indirect resources and those from the same heap.
