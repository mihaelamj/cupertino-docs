  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAfter you thoroughly test your app in Xcode, distribute it to beta testers or release it to users to run on their personal devices. Choose a distribution method based on your app’s platform and development stage, and whether you belong to the Apple Developer Program. Before you release your app to users, distribute your final build using one of the beta test methods.\n\nIf necessary, review [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/preparing-your-app-for-distribution] to complete the configuration of your project, before following these distribution steps.\n\n### Join the Apple Developer Program\n\nDistribution methods range from exporting your app for test devices to uploading it to App Store Connect. You can use TestFlight to distribute beta builds to testers and collect feedback. If you want to distribute your app to registered devices, to beta testers using TestFlight, or through the App Store, join the Apple Developer Program. After you join the Apple Developer Program, Apple creates an App Store Connect account for you and you can start uploading builds.\n\nJoining the Apple Developer Program provides access to the distribution methods, as well as capabilities you can add to your app. A capability grants your app access to an app service provided by Apple, such as CloudKit, Game Center, or In-App Purchase. To learn more about capabilities, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app].\n\nXcode uses cloud-managed signing certificates to automatically code sign your app. These signing certificates are associated with your Apple Developer Account, you can manage access to these certificates in App Store Connect. For information on managing access to certificate resources for your team, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-your-team\/add-and-edit-users].\n\nTo learn more about enrolling in the program, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/].\n\n### Combine multiplatform apps in a project or purchase\n\nIf you offer related apps on different platforms, combine them in one Xcode project or App Store purchase to make installation more convenient for users. To allow your customers to purchase related apps together from the App Store as a universal purchase or app bundle, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/support\/universal-purchase\/].\n\n### Create an archive of your app\n\nTo use any of the distribution methods, first create an archive of your app. An *archive* is a build of your app, including debugging information, that Xcode stores in a bundle. Xcode repackages the archive’s contents based on the distribution configuration you choose for your distribution.\n\nIn the main window of your Xcode project, choose a scheme and a run destination to build for from the Scheme toolbar menu. Then, choose Product > Archive to build the targets included in that scheme, for the class of device you select, and create an archive that appears in the Archives organizer.\n\n\n\nYou can open the Archives organizer directly by choosing Window > Organizer. If you want to confirm your app is ready to submit to TestFlight or the App Store without submitting it yet, select your archive and then click Validate App. Xcode will perform a limited, automated initial validation of the app and provide feedback.\n\nFor a Mac app built with Mac Catalyst, create separate archives for the iPad and Mac version. When creating the archive for the Mac version, choose My Mac as the run destination.\n\n### Select a method for distribution\n\nYou can export the archive or upload it to App Store Connect. If you export the archive, you can distribute it outside of the App Store. Otherwise, upload the archive to App Store Connect to distribute it through TestFlight or the App Store.\n\nFrom the Organizer window in Xcode, select Archives in the sidebar and click Distribute App.\n\n\n\nSelect one of the following options to distribute using recommended settings:\n\nAfter selecting a distribution option, click the Distribute button. Xcode begins processing, packaging, and uploading. Click the link at the at the end to access the builds page for the app on App Store Connect or click the Export button to access the assets locally.\n\n### Create a custom distribution\n\nTo begin a custom distribution, which allows you to configure your own settings, click the Custom option.\n\n\n\nSelect from the following distribution methods:\n\nIf you choose App Store Connect or Developer ID as your distribution method, you select a destination option as well. You can choose to upload your build to the App Store, or Export your build locally to upload later.\n\n\n\nWhen distributing your app on TestFlight or the App Store, choose how to manage symbols and build numbers:\n\n\n\nWhen selecting a distribution method that involves code signing, select a method for code signing.\n\n\n\nChoosing “Automatically manage signing” allows Xcode to manage signing for you. To manually sign your app, you use signing certificates. For information on sharing signing certificates, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/sharing-your-teams-signing-certificates].\n\nWhen packaging for self distribution using the Ad Hoc or Development option, choose whether to enable or disable App Thinning and configure on-demand resources settings. For more information about App Thinning and on-demand resources, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/reducing-your-app-s-size] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/doing-advanced-optimization-to-further-reduce-your-app-s-size].\n\n\n\n### Distribute a beta version\n\nTo distribute a beta version of your app to offer a preview of an upcoming release, chose a distribution method that aligns with your testing resources:\n\n\n\n### Publish on the App Store\n\nAfter beta testing your final build, submit it to App Review, then offer it on the App Store. For more information about the publishing process, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-your-apps-availability\/overview-of-publishing-your-app].\n\nGo to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/review\/] to review the App Store and Human Interface Guidelines. For platform specific guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/submitting].\n\nYou may need to enter additional information in App Store Connect before you can submit your app to App Review. After your app is uploaded or released, you can’t change some of this metadata, so it’s important to choose your settings carefully. For more information about this metadata, go to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/reference\/required-localizable-and-editable-properties] in App Store Connect Help.\n\nIf you used TestFlight to distribute a beta version, and entered the additional information required by App Store for a release, just submit the last build that appears in App Store Connect to App Review.\n\n\n\nIf you didn’t distribute the final build using TestFlight, prepare your app for distribution and create an archive of your app. Validate the archive and fix any validation errors before continuing. Then, upload it to App Store Connect and wait for it to pass the App Store Connect validation tests.\n\nTo submit the build to App Review, go to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/manage-submissions-to-app-review\/submit-for-review].\n\n### Distribute outside of the App Store\n\nFor macOS apps, you can export a notarized app for distribution outside of the App Store, but you may first need to disable capabilities that require the Apple Developer Program membership first, then distribute the app yourself to users. Notarize all software that you distribute outside of the App Store. This includes system extensions and drivers. To learn more, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/notarizing-macos-software-before-distribution].\n\n### Distribute enterprise apps\n\nThere are also several options for distributing business, customized, or in-house apps as well. For details, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/business\/distribute\/]. If you join the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/enterprise\/], see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/devba5e7054d] for enterprise-specific Xcode steps to export your app.\n\n### Review crash, diagnostic, and metrics reports\n\nIf you distribute your app using TestFlight or through the App Store, you can view crash and diagnostic reports that Apple generates for you in the organizer. You can also use the organizer to review feedback from beta testers. If you distribute your app through the App Store, you can view metrics reports in the organizer too. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/acquiring-crash-reports-and-diagnostic-logs] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/viewing-and-responding-to-feedback]. For more information about performance improvements, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/improving-your-app-s-performance] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/analyzing-the-performance-of-your-shipping-app].",

The TestFlight app allows invited users to install, beta test, provide feedback, and get updates of your app. Apple distributes the beta version for you, you manage the builds and users in App Store Connect. To learn more, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/test-a-beta-version\/overview-of-testflight].\n- Distribute a beta version to registered devices in your developer account. Choose this option only if you can reserve a portion of your limited development devices for beta testing. To learn more, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/distributing-your-app-to-registered-devices].\n- For macOS apps, distribute an Apple-notarized build to testers before you distribute the app through the App Store.
