  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nCustomers expect apps to be stable, free of bugs, and use system resources efficiently. The operating system helps you meet these expectations by collecting different log types you can use to diagnose issues in your app:\n\nDistribution builds of your app, such as for the App Store, an enterprise environment, or a testing team, require you to use crash reports and device logs to diagnose issues encountered by your customers. Distribution builds don’t contain the necessary entitlements for debugging in Xcode.\n\n### Address stability issues using crash reports\n\nCrash reports are the most common type of log you’ll use when diagnosing an issue. When receiving crash reports for your app, use them to understand the stability problems the app is having. A crash report describes how your app terminated, and also contains the complete backtrace of each thread, which shows the code running at the time of the crash.\n\nTo debug a problem using a crash report:\n\n### Uncover memory inefficiencies using jetsam event reports\n\nEnsure that your apps use memory efficiently. When an app on iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS uses memory inefficiently, less memory is available for other apps to remain in memory in the background. This lower available memory limits how quickly a user can switch between apps, because apps can’t resume from memory and must first complete a full app launch.\n\nWhen the operating system experiences low-memory conditions, and requires more memory than is currently free, the device’s operating system can terminate apps to reclaim the memory they’re using. A jetsam event report describes the system-memory conditions under which the operating system  terminated an app. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/acquiring-crash-reports-and-diagnostic-logs#Locate-crash-reports-and-memory-logs-on-the-device] for how to access these logs and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/identifying-high-memory-use-with-jetsam-event-reports] for information on interpreting a jetsam event report.\n\nJetsam event reports don’t contain stack traces of executing threads in an app, but they do contain additional system information about memory use. When your app crashes due to memory pressure, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/gathering-information-about-memory-use] to understand your app’s memory use patterns, and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/responding-to-low-memory-warnings] to learn when to lower your memory use.\n\n### Diagnose problems using device console logs\n\nApple devices maintain a continuous in-memory transcript of operations in the operating system and individual apps. These logs can be reviewed after an issue occurs. Some issues, such as problems installing an app, can be diagnosed by reviewing the operating system logs using the Console app on macOS. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/acquiring-crash-reports-and-diagnostic-logs#Access-device-console-logs] for instructions on accessing a device’s console log.\n\nAdd log messages for your app to the operating system’s log with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/os\/logging] framework. The logs you provide can contain additional grouping and labeling information to assist with tracing an issue from the original user action. This information is useful for diagnosing complex interactions, such as debugging the interaction between your app and one of its app extensions.",

The operating system helps you meet these expectations by collecting different log types you can use to diagnose issues in your app:\n\n- Crash reports describe how your app terminated, and document the code running on each thread at the time of the crash.\n- Jetsam event reports describe the system-memory conditions under which the operating system terminated an app.\n- Device console logs contain detailed information on operations that occur in both the operating system and apps.\n\nDistribution builds of your app, such as for the App Store, an enterprise environment, or a testing team, require you to use crash reports and device logs to diagnose issues encountered by your customers.

A crash report describes how your app terminated, and also contains the complete backtrace of each thread, which shows the code running at the time of the crash.\n\nTo debug a problem using a crash report:\n\n1. [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information#Build-your-app-with-symbol-information] and retain the Xcode archive before distributing the app.\n2. Retrieve a crash report for an issue. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/acquiring-crash-reports-and-diagnostic-logs] for the different ways you can retrieve crash reports.\n3. Convert the hexadecimal addresses into symbol names for your app, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-identifiable-symbol-names-to-a-crash-report].\n4. Determine if the crash fits any of the patterns in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/identifying-the-cause-of-common-crashes]. Consult [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/analyzing-a-crash-report] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report] for additional insight on the issue.\n5. Update your code to fix the issue.\n6. Add tests with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest] framework to ensure the issue doesn’t reoccur in the future.\n\n### Uncover memory inefficiencies using jetsam event reports\n\nEnsure that your apps use memory efficiently.
