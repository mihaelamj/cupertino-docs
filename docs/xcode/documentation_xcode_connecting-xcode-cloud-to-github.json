Configure your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud and create your first workflow as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Your-First-Xcode-Cloud-Workflow]. Xcode analyzes your project to learn which SCM provider you use and then indicates that you use GitHub.\n2. Click Grant Access. Xcode opens your browser and takes you to the [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] website.\n3. Click Complete Step 1 in GitHub to link your Apple Account with your GitHub account to open the GitHub website.\n4. Review the permissions Xcode Cloud requests, and authorize Xcode Cloud to link your GitHub account to your Apple Account.\n5. Review the GitHub app that Apple provides on the GitHub website and choose to only install it for your project’s repository. Don’t install it for every repository. GitHub uses the app to grant Xcode Cloud access to your repository.\n6. Click Install to return to App Store Connect website. It indicates that you successfully connected Xcode Cloud to GitHub.\n7. Return to Xcode. It indicates that Xcode Cloud can access your source code.\n8. Click Next, complete the configuration of your first workflow, and start your first build.\n\n## GitHub and GitHub Enterprise\n\n- **Connecting Xcode Cloud to GitHub Enterprise**: Allow Xcode Cloud to access your GitHub Enterprise repository.\n\n",
