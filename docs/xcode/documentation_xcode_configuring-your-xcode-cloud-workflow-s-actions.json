  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWith Xcode Cloud, you can create custom workflows to adopt a flexible continuous integration and delivery (CI\/CD) practice. For example, configure a workflow that verifies changes by building and testing your app or framework, a workflow that performs in-depth verifications, another workflow to regularly deliver a new version of your app to testers, and so on. At the core of each workflow are the actions Xcode Cloud performs during a build.\n\nIf you’re new to creating custom workflows, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Developing-a-Workflow-Strategy-for-Xcode-Cloud]. For more information on other workflow settings, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Xcode-Cloud-Workflow-Reference].\n\nYou need to use Xcode to initially configure your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud.

Choose from the following actions:\n\nFor example, configure a workflow to perform the build, test, and archive actions for each platform.\n\nA good practice to follow when using Xcode Cloud is to create a set of workflows with each performing different actions. For example, you could have one workflow for building and testing actions whenever there’s a change to a branch or pull request, and you could have a second workflow that performs build, test, analyze, and archive actions whenever you merge code into your `main` branch.\n\n\n\nWhen Xcode Cloud performs an action, it:\n\n### Add an action to a workflow\n\nTo add an action to a workflow, first open or create a workflow in Xcode or in the Xcode Cloud tab on the [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] website. Click the Add button (+) next to Actions, choose an action, enter required information, choose from available settings, and save the workflow. Then, manually start a new build or wait for Xcode Cloud to start a new build.\n\nThe following screenshot shows Xcode’s Edit Workflow sheet for a workflow that performs all four available actions:\n\n\n\n### Add a build action\n\nVerifying that a change always compiles is one of the key tasks of a CI\/CD.

Upon completion, Xcode Cloud makes the following artifacts available: the build product, build logs, and the result bundle.\n\n### Add a test action\n\nVerifying a change by running your tests is another key task of a CI\/CD practice.

It includes two test actions: one action tests the iOS app, and the other action tests the macOS app.\n\n\n\nA test action runs in two separate phases: In the first phase, Xcode Cloud accesses your source code and creates test products using the `xcodebuild build-for-testing` command. In the second phase, Xcode Cloud uses the test products it creates in the first phase to run your tests using the `xcodebuild test-without-building` command.\n\nWhen Xcode Cloud completes the test action, it makes test products and the result bundle with the test results available as artifacts.\n\nFor additional information on using Xcode Cloud to run your tests, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc22\/110361].\n\n### Add an analyze action\n\nIn addition to building and testing your code, analyzing it with Xcode can help you verify that your code is free from memory leaks and other issues.

Adding an analyze action to an Xcode Cloud workflow ensures you regularly analyze your code to identify errors before they become issues.\n\nTo add an analyze action to a workflow:\n\nWhen Xcode Cloud performs the analyze action, it accesses your source code and runs the `xcodebuild analyze` command to perform static code analysis.

Open or create a workflow in Xcode or in the Xcode Cloud tab on the App Store Connect website.\n2. Click the Add button next to Actions, and choose Build.\n3. Choose a platform and a scheme; for example, choose macOS and your macOS app’s corresponding scheme to build your Mac app.\n4. Choose whether you want to build the app for any device or any simulator destinations. For a Mac app, choose between building macOS and Mac Catalyst destinations.\n\nThe following screenshot shows an Xcode Cloud workflow for the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/swiftui\/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui].

While every project comes with its unique requirements, it usually makes sense to configure two workflows that perform a test action:\n\n- A workflow that frequently runs basic, short running tests.\n- A workflow that runs more extensive, long-running tests less frequently.\n\n\n\nTo add a test action to a workflow:\n\n1. Open or create a workflow in Xcode or in the Xcode Cloud tab on the [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] website.\n2. Click the Add button next to Actions, and choose Test.\n3. Choose a platform and a scheme for the test action.\n4. Decide if you want a build to fail when the test action fails, then choose “Required To Pass” or “Not Required to Pass,” accordingly.\n5. Choose Use Scheme Settings if you want the test action to use the selected scheme’s configuration. Alternatively, choose a test plan if you use them. For more information on test plans, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2019\/413\/] and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2020\/10221\/].\n6. Add at least one destination by clicking the Add button. Available destinations depend on the workflow’s environment setting. A higher number of destinations increases the time it takes Xcode Cloud to complete a build.\n\nThe following screenshot shows an Xcode Cloud workflow for the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/swiftui\/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui].
