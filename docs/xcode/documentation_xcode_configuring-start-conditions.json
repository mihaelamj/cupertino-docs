  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nXcode Cloud watches your Git repository for changes, checks whether a change meets start conditions you configure for your workflows, and starts a build when a change meets one of the conditions. This makes configuring start conditions a key task when you create custom Xcode Cloud workflows.\n\nYou can configure your Xcode Cloud workflow with any of the following start conditions:\n\nBy configuring several start conditions for one workflow and reusing the workflow at different moments in your development life cycle, you can reduce the number of workflows you need to maintain. For example, you can configure one workflow to perform verifications for each change to a branch or a pull request — you don’t need to configure two separate workflows.\n\nFor additional information about Xcode Cloud workflows, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Xcode-Cloud-Workflow-Reference], [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10268], and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc21\/10269].\n\n## Edit, add, and remove start conditions\n\nTo make changes to a workflow’s start conditions, open your workflow in Xcode, choose an already configured start condition in the Start Conditions section, or add a new start condition using the Add button (+) next to Start Conditions.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, configure your workflow and its start conditions in the Xcode Cloud tab on the [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] website. This is especially convenient if you manage Xcode Cloud workflows but don’t have access to the Xcode project — a common case in a corporate context.\n\n\n\n### Review the default start condition\n\nWhen you create a new workflow, Xcode configures a default workflow that uses the Branch Changes start condition for each change to your repository’s default branch. Even if the workflow doesn’t take a lot of time to complete, starting a new build for every change from your repository’s default branch can be impractical. For example, a workflow that runs UI tests on many simulated devices can take a significant amount of time and slow your development cycle. To start builds less frequently, use a different start condition or configure Xcode Cloud to monitor or ignore changes to specific files or folders as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Start-Conditions#Monitor-or-ignore-specific-files-and-folders] below.\n\n### Monitor custom branches for changes\n\nBy default, workflows use the Branch Changes start condition for your Git repository’s default branch. However, you might want to configure Xcode Cloud to monitor a different branch, several branches, or every branch for changes.\n\nFirst, open your workflow in Xcode or App Store Connect. Select or add the Branch Changes start condition, then choose from the following settings:\n\n\n\nYou can further customize the Branch Changes start condition with the Custom Conditions setting. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Start-Conditions#Monitor-or-ignore-specific-files-and-folders] below.\n\n### Start builds for changes to a pull request\n\nBy using pull requests, you use a collaborative software development process that helps with identifying errors. To help detect issues in a PR, add the Pull Request Changes start condition to a workflow. Xcode Cloud starts a new build when you create or update a PR.\n\nWhen it detects a new or updated PR, Xcode Cloud checks out the PR’s source branch — the branch that contains your changes — and the PR’s target branch. It then merges both branches in a temporary environment and performs the workflow’s configured actions.\n\nBy default, the Pull Request Changes condition starts a new build for each new or updated PR. However, you can choose from the following settings for the Pull Request Changes start condition to limit when Xcode Cloud performs the workflow:\n\nInstead of specifying several custom source and target branches, configure a workflow to start a build if a PR involves branches that start with a custom string. For example, use Any Branch for the Source Branch setting. Then, change the Target Branch setting to Custom Branches and enter `release`. As a result, Xcode Cloud starts a build from every PR that targets branches that start with  `release`.\n\n\n\nYou can further customize the Pull Request Changes start condition with the Custom Conditions setting. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Start-Conditions#Monitor-or-ignore-specific-files-and-folders] below.\n\n### Start builds for new or updated Git tags\n\nSimilar to how you can configure a workflow that starts a new build if a branch changes, configure Xcode Cloud to start a build if you create or update a Git tag. Add the Tag Changes start condition in Xcode or App Store Connect to a workflow and choose between:\n\n\n\nYou can further customize the Branch Changes start condition with the Custom Conditions setting.\n\n### Monitor or ignore specific files and folders\n\nIf you add the Branch Changes, Pull Request Changes, or Tag Changes start condition to a workflow, there’s a chance Xcode Cloud starts new builds too often. For example, your team may use a single repository for all of your team’s code and not every change affects your app. In contrast, you might want Xcode Cloud to only start a build if a specific file or folder changes. To accommodate these use cases, further configure start conditions to ignore changes to custom files and folders or to only start a build if a specified file or folder changes.\n\nFirst, open a workflow in Xcode or App Store Connect and select a start condition. Change the Files and Folders setting to Custom Conditions. Then, add one or more custom conditions to tell Xcode Cloud to ignore changes to specific files and folders, or to start a build in response to changes to specific files or folders.\n\nYou can configure a custom condition to either start or skip a build if:\n\nFor example:\n\nIf you choose Filename, don’t include a wildcard like `*` in the filename. For example, don’t enter `Release-Notes-*.md`. If you tell Xcode Cloud to monitor a specific folder for changes, it recursively monitors files contained in the given folder. For example, if you organize your code in a `Source` folder and tell Xcode Cloud to monitor it for changes, changes to files in `Source\/iOS` start a new Xcode Cloud build.\n\n### Skip a build\n\nWhen you push changes to your Git repository in quick succession — for example, in early development of your app — you may want Xcode Cloud to ignore a change and not start a build. To tell Xcode Cloud to skip a build when you push changes, include `[ci skip]` in the title or message of the latest commit you push to your remote repository.\n\nIf you require Xcode Cloud builds or actions to succeed before users can merge a PR, the website for a PR indicates that Xcode Cloud skipped a build for the most recent change. To learn more about configuring requirements for PRs, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Requirements-for-Merging-a-Pull-Request].\n\n### Set a schedule\n\nIn addition to starting a build when a change meets a start condition, you can configure a workflow to start a build based on a schedule. For example, distributing a new version of your app to testers with [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/testflight\/] for every branch or pull request change will overwhelm your testers. Instead, distribute a new version based on a schedule; for example, once per week.\n\nTo configure a workflow to start a build based on a schedule, add the On a Schedule for a Branch start condition and specify the frequency, time, and branch.\n\nThe following screenshot shows a workflow that starts a build on every business day at 10:00 p.m. Central European Time from the `main` branch:\n\n\n\n### Manually start a build\n\nTeam members can manually start an Xcode Cloud build for workflows you configure with specific start conditions. To support starting a build manually without tying it to a Git event or a schedule, add a Manual Start condition and configure the specific branches, tags, and pull requests to which it applies.",
