GPUs create new threads when they have commands with more threads to dispatch and enough internal resources. It’s generally better to have higher occupancy when the app is making efficient use of the GPU.\n\nThe sum of these percentages is the total percentage of the GPU’s capacity in use.\n\nYou can get shader occupancy counters in Instruments and in the Metal debugger’s Performance timeline.

Each shader has a maximum theoretical occupancy, depending on the amount of internal resources it consumes on the device.

For example, a low vertex shader occupancy may be OK if your fragment shaders are running concurrently with high occupancy.
