  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nMetal comes with a comprehensive suite of advanced developer tools to help you debug and optimize your Metal apps.\n\n### Runtime diagnostics\n\nYou can enable API Validation when running your app to check for incorrect Metal API usage. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Validating-your-apps-Metal-API-usage].\n\nEnable Shader Validation when running your app to check for issues like out-of-bounds memory access, missing `useResource` calls, and stack overflows. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Validating-your-apps-Metal-shader-usage].\n\nThe Metal Performance HUD offers a visual overlay to catch performance issues while your app is running. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Monitoring-your-Metal-apps-graphics-performance].\n\n### Runtime performance analysis\n\nThe Metal system trace tool in Instruments provides a visual timeline of the parallel work on the CPU and the GPU, and the memory usage of your Metal app.\n\n\n\nYou can begin profiling with the Game Performance template (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Analyzing-the-performance-of-your-Metal-app]) or the Game Memory template (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Analyzing-the-memory-usage-of-your-Metal-app]).\n\n### Advanced Metal debugging and profiling\n\nThe Metal debugger in Xcode provides advanced tools for debugging and profiling your Metal app.\n\n\n\nYou can get summaries of your Metal workload with the Dependencies viewer and the Memory viewer, inspect individual resources, and selectively debug your shaders. For more information on debugging, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Investigating-visual-artifacts].\n\nIn addition, you can optimize your Metal app by drilling down performance bottlenecks with the Performance timeline and the per-line shader profiling results. For more information on profiling, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Optimizing-GPU-performance].\n\nLearn more about [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Metal-debugger].",
