When a particular target wants to make a keychain item accessible to the rest of the access group, it specifies the shared keychain group when writing that item to the keychain, which can be useful for apps that need to share account credentials and other sensitive information. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/sharing-access-to-keychain-items-among-a-collection-of-apps].\n\nBefore you make a keychain group accessible to your target, follow the steps in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability] section of [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app] to add the Keychain Sharing capability to that target. For watchOS apps with separate WatchKit extensions, add the capability to the WatchKit Extension target.\n\n\n\nIf not already present, Xcode updates your target’s entitlements file to include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/keychain-access-groups], which is an array that contains each keychain group you specify.\n\n### Make a keychain group accessible to your target\n\nWhen you want two (or more) targets to share common keychain items, make the same keychain group accessible to both by following these steps:\n\n1. Select your project in Xcode’s Project navigator.\n2. Select the app’s target from the Targets list.\n3. Click the Signing & Capabilities tab in the project editor.\n4. Find the Keychain Sharing capability.\n5. Click the Add (+) button below the Keychain Groups list.\n6. Double-click the inserted keychain group to edit it.\n7. Enter a name for the keychain group: either the name of an existing group that’s already in use by your other apps, or a brand new group. For new groups, use reverse DNS notation for the name.\n8. Press the Return key to save the updated keychain group.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you make a keychain group accessible to your target, you can later revoke that access by selecting the appropriate keychain group and clicking the Remove button (-) below the Keychain Groups list.\n\nKeychain groups you specify are then available to use with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/keychain-services] APIs, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/SecItemAdd(_:_:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/SecItemCopyMatching(_:_:)].\n\n### Specify the default keychain group\n\nDuring compilation, the system determines the canonical list of keychain groups accessible to your app by concatenating the groups you specify with the app’s unique application identifier and any App Groups you configure; the system considers the first item in that list as the default keychain group. If you omit the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Security\/kSecAttrAccessGroup] attribute when writing keychain items, the system automatically populates that attribute with the default keychain group, and therefore the order in which you specify your keychain groups matters.\n\nTo change the order of your keychain groups, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the Project navigator, Control-click your target’s entitlements file.\n2. Choose Open As > Property List.\n3. Expand the Keychain Access Groups key.\n4. Drag the array’s nested items into your preferred order. Each item’s value is the name of a keychain group.\n\n\n\nAfter making changes to the order, choose File > Save to store those changes and cause Xcode to update the order it displays the groups in the target’s Signing & Capabilities tab.\n\n\n\n## Security\n\n- **Configuring Family Controls**: Add the Family Controls entitlement to enable parental control features in your app and its Screen Time API app extensions.\n- **Configuring the hardened runtime**: Protect the runtime integrity of your macOS app by restricting access to sensitive resources and preventing common exploits.\n- **Configuring the macOS App Sandbox**: Protect system resources and user data from compromised apps by restricting access to the file system, network connections, and more.\n- **Protecting local app data using containers on macOS**: Secure your app’s local storage data from unauthorized access and modification.\n- **Accessing app group containers in your existing macOS app**: Ensure your app has app group container entitlements and macOS can authorize them.\n\n",
