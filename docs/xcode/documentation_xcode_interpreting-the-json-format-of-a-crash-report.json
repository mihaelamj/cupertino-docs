  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nStarting with iOS 15 and macOS 12, apps that generate crash reports store the data as JSON in files with an `.ips` extension. Tools for viewing these files, such as Console, translate the JSON to make it easier to read and interpret. The translated content uses field names the article [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report] describes. Use the following information to understand the structure of the JSON the system uses for these crash reports and how the data maps to the field names found in the translated content.\n\nTypical JSON parsers expect a single JSON object in the body of the file. The IPS file for a crash report contains two JSON objects: an object containing IPS metadata about the report incident and an object containing the crash report data. When parsing the file, extract the JSON for the metadata object from the first line. If the `bug_type` property of the metadata object is `309`, the log type for crash reports, you can extract the JSON for the crash report data from the remainder of the text.\n\nThe following example reads the contents of a crash report into a dictionary:\n\nThe crash report data is made up of additional objects pertaining to OS version, bundle, store, exception, termination, threads, frames, and binary images. The properties of all these objects are outlined below.\n\n### IPS metadata\n\nThe IPS metadata object contains the following properties:\n\n### Crash report\n\nThe crash report object can contain the following properties:\n\n### Platforms\n\nThe numeric values for `platform` include:\n\n### OS version\n\nA report includes OS version information in an object that can contain the following properties:\n\n### Bundle info\n\nA report includes bundle information in an object with the following properties:\n\n### Store info\n\nA report includes store information in an object with the following properties:\n\n### Exception\n\nA report includes exception information in an object with the following properties:\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report#Exception-information].\n\n### Termination\n\nA report includes termination information in an object that can contain the following properties:\n\nFor details on how to use this information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report#Exception-information].\n\nJSON stores numeric values as decimal numbers. The value the system stores in the `code` property is intended to be viewed in its hexadecimal form; see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/interpreting-the-JSON-format-of-a-crash-report#Convert-numeric-values-to-hexadecimal-numbers].\n\n### Threads\n\nA report includes thread information in objects that can contain the following properties:\n\nFor details on how to use this information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report#Backtraces] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report#Thread-state].\n\nJSON contains numbers for memory addresses in frame and thread state objects as decimal digits. To view the numbers contained in these fields in their more common hexadecimal form, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/interpreting-the-JSON-format-of-a-crash-report#Convert-numeric-values-to-hexadecimal-numbers].\n\n### Frames\n\nA report includes information about frames in objects with the following properties:\n\nFor details on how to use this information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report#Backtraces].\n\nJSON contains numbers for the memory locations and offsets as decimal digits. To convert the numbers contained in these fields to their more common hexadecimal form, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/interpreting-the-JSON-format-of-a-crash-report#Convert-numeric-values-to-hexadecimal-numbers].\n\n### Binary images\n\nA report includes information about binary images loaded in the process at the time of termination in objects with the following properties:\n\nFor details on how to use this information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/examining-the-fields-in-a-crash-report#Binary-images].\n\n### Convert numeric values to hexadecimal numbers\n\nJSON stores numeric values as decimal numbers. Many of these numeric values, such as error codes and memory addresses, appear in a translated report as hexadecimal numbers to make them easier to interpret.\n\nYou can use the following to print a hexadecimal representation of the numbers from the decimal representation found in the JSON.",
