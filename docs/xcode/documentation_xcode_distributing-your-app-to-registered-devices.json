  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nBefore [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases], you can distribute progress builds to a limited set of users on known devices, without having to go through beta app review. To distribute to this group of users, register their devices in your [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/]. You can register a limited number of devices, per product family per year, that your team uses for development and testing.\n\n### Prepare for your build\n\nTo prepare to distribute your build, you need:\n\nIf you choose the default automatic signing, Xcode creates the provisioning profiles for you, that include all your registered devices; for more advanced cases like large teams with restricted access to signing assets or to only include a subset of your registered devices, prepare your provisioning assets manually. In both automatic and manual provisioning, you need to gather and add your list of test devices to your developer account. When you manually provision a profile, update your provisioning profile after adding test devices.\n\nEach iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS device has a persistent, unique identifier referred to as a device ID. When you use automatic signing, Xcode registers the device for you. Otherwise, you need to collect the device ID and register the device in your developer account.\n\n### Register devices automatically in Xcode\n\nWhen you use automatic signing, Xcode registers the connected device or Mac for you. For iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS attach your device to your computer, and select Trust if the device asks to trust your computer. For watchOS, attach the paired phone for your watchOS device to your computer.\n\nIn Xcode, select your attached device as the run destination, and build and run your app. For more information on simulated apps, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device]. If your device needs to be registered, click the Register button in the dialog that Xcode displays, and Xcode registers and adds the device to your provisioning profile.\n\n### Collect device identifiers: iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS\n\nWhen you use manual signing, start by collecting the device identifier for your iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS device by using either Finder or Xcode.\n\nAttach your device to your Mac with a cable, and select Trust if your device asks to trust your computer. For watchOS, attach the phone, to which your watch is paired, with to your Mac and use Xcode to find the identifier.\n\nUsing the Finder:\n\nUsing Xcode:\n\n### Collect device identifiers: macOS\n\nTo find the device ID for your Mac:\n\n### Register devices in your developer account\n\nAfter you collect the device IDs, you can register them all at once by putting the device names and identifiers in a file. Sign into your developer account, then:\n\nFor more information on multi-device registration, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/register-devices\/register-multiple-devices].\n\nAdd a single device by clicking the plus (+) button next to the Devices title. Specify the identifier and a name for the device. Use a name that makes the device easy to identify; for example, combine the owner’s name and device type, ”Ravi Patel’s iPhone 11”.\n\nYou can disable devices that you no longer permit to use your app: select the device and click Disable. Code signing doesn’t include the device while it’s disabled, but the device counts against the number of devices in the product family until your account renewal date. Disabling a device invalidates any provisioning profiles that include the device; automatic signing regenerates the profile the next time you build your app, or you can regenerate the profile manually if you’re not using automatic signing.\n\n### Update your provisioning profile\n\nWhen you use automatic signing, Xcode automatically updates the provisioning profile when you export the app.\n\nTo use manual signing, sign in to your developer account, select Certificates, Identifiers, and Profiles, then select Profiles. Click the plus sign next to the Profiles header to create a new provisioning profile. Then:\n\nYou can edit an existing profile and regenerate it to add or remove devices. Once you generate the profile, download it, then drag the downloaded profile to the Xcode dock icon and drop it to install it. You can also download it from Xcode > Settings > Accounts, using the Download Manual Profiles button when you select your account.\n\n### Configure code signing\n\nTo allow Xcode to manage signing for you, toggle the Automatically manage signing checkbox from the Signing & Capabilities tab in the project editor and select a Team. To manually sign your app, select a profile to use from the Provisioning Profile dropdown menu. You can also select Import profile or Download profile to add an additional profile from your account.\n\n### Archive the app\n\nIn the main window of your Xcode project, choose a target and a run destination from the Scheme toolbar menu. If you select a simulator for your run destination, Xcode builds an archive matching the build-only device type for that simulator. Choose Product > Archive to build the target and Xcode displays the archive in the Archives organizer.\n\n### Export the app\n\nFrom the archive, export a version of the app to distribute to users:\n\nFor more information on solving issues with code signing, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/thread\/707080].\n\n### Install the app on user devices\n\nWhen you save the exported app, Xcode creates a folder that contains a few files, including the iOS App file, which is a file with an `.ipa` filename extension. Distribute that file to your users so they can install it on their devices by using Xcode or Apple Configurator 2.\n\nFor macOS, double-click the file to install and run it.\n\nTo install iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS apps using Xcode:\n\nTo install iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS apps with Apple Configurator 2:",

On iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS you need a distribution certificate; on macOS you need a development certificate.
