When you plug your compatible device into a supported external display, the device mirrors its display to the external display.\n\nIn addition to external displays, iPhone devices running iOS 12.0 and later support connecting to CarPlay compatible vehicles. For more information on supporting CarPlay in your app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CarPlay].\n\nTest your app’s support of external displays or CarPlay in Simulator during development, then test on actual devices.\n\n### Enable an external display or CarPlay\n\nFirst, build and run your app in Simulator.
