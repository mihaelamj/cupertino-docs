  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTypically, an app is in a suspended state when it’s in the background. However, there are a limited number of background execution modes your app can support that enable it to run when in the background, such as playing audio, receiving location updates, or processing scheduled tasks. For apps that adopt one or more of these modes, the system launches or resumes the app, in the background, and affords it time to process any related events.\n\nUse background execution modes sparingly because overuse can negatively impact device performance and battery life. If an alternative to executing in the background exists, use the alternative instead. For example, apps can use the significant-change location service to receive location events as an alternative to using the Location updates background mode.\n\nBefore you can select the background execution modes your app requires, follow the steps in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability] to add the Background Modes capability to your app’s target.\n\n\n\nThe background execution modes that appear after you add the capability depend on the target’s platform.

Select your project in Xcode’s Project navigator.\n2. Select the app’s target in the Targets list.\n3. Click the Signing & Capabilities tab in the project editor.\n4. Find the Background Modes capability.\n5. Select one or more background execution modes using the corresponding checkboxes.\n6. For watchOS apps, choose the appropriate session type from the pop-up menu.
