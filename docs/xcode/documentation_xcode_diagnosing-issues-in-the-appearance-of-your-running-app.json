If you configure a scheme’s run action for debugging by using the Debug executable checkbox in Info settings, the app will attach to the debugger automatically when the app uses the scheme.

Xcode provides environmental overrides when targeting iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS apps to help you debug these issue.
