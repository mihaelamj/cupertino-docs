  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nXcode consists of a suite of tools you use to build, test, and release apps and frameworks for Apple platforms. When you add features and support more devices and platforms, your app or framework and its codebase grow in complexity, making it harder to ensure its quality. With Xcode Cloud, you can adopt *continuous integration and delivery* (CI\/CD), a standard practice to monitor, ensure, and improve the quality of your apps and frameworks.\n\nXcode Cloud is a CI\/CD system that uses Git for source control and provides you with an integrated system that ensures the quality and stability of your codebase. It also helps you publish apps efficiently. By combining [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/xcode\/] with Apple’s cloud infrastructure for building and testing your code — along with [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/testflight\/] and [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] — Xcode Cloud makes it easy for you to:\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to introduce every aspect of continuous integration and delivery at once. Instead, take a slow but steady approach and start by using [https:\/\/git-scm.com] for managing your project’s source code. After you’re comfortable with Git’s workflows and processes, configure your project to use Xcode Cloud at the most basic level — for continually building and testing your projects. As you become more familiar with how Xcode Cloud works, you can start to take advantage of its CD features like delivering test builds with TestFlight.\n\n### The role of source control\n\nChanges to your app’s code can be difficult to manage. This is especially true when you work on several changes at the same time. To help you organize, manage, and document source code changes, Xcode supports source control with Git. By using source control, you improve your project’s quality by tracking and reviewing code changes.\n\nBecause source control plays such a fundamental role in CI\/CD, Xcode Cloud requires your code to be in a Git repository. It supports the following *source code management* (SCM) providers:\n\nTo learn more about source control with Xcode, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/source-control-management].\n\n### The importance of automated building and testing\n\nA typical development process starts with making changes to your code, building the project, and running your app in the Simulator or on a test device. Your process may even include verifying changes locally by running unit tests you create with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest], and by running integration, performance, or user interface tests.\n\nWhile Xcode can reduce the time it takes to perform these tasks, they still take a significant amount of your time. This is especially true for complex apps or frameworks that support a wide range of devices and operating systems. With Xcode Cloud, however, you can build, run, and test your project on multiple simulated devices in less time than you can traditionally.\n\n\n\nAfter verifying a change, Xcode Cloud automatically notifies you about the result via email. You can also view the results in Xcode or in App Store Connect. This helps you detect errors before they become an issue, and gives you the reassurance you need about the stability and quality of your code.\n\nFor more information about automatically building your project with Xcode Cloud, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Your-First-Xcode-Cloud-Workflow].\n\nFor more information about testing your code, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/testing].\n\n### Continuous delivery\n\nThe flip side to continuous integration (CI) is continuous delivery (CD). While automatic building and testing are important to developing high-quality apps and frameworks, it doesn’t replace the hands-on testing you get from team members and testers. When Xcode Cloud verifies a change to your code (CI), it can automatically deliver (CD) a new version of your app to internal testers with [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/testflight\/]. Xcode Cloud can also sign your app for external testing with TestFlight and submission to app review. You can also upload the exported app archive or a framework to your own server.\n\n\n\n### Collaborative software development with Xcode Cloud\n\nSource control with Git helps you manage changes to your code. For example, Git branches enable you to make a change without affecting your verified, stable codebase. Additionally, branches are helpful when you develop your app or framework as a team. However, merging changes, resolving conflicts, and verifying code changes can be time-consuming.\n\nTo make code review and merging easier, SCM providers offer support for *pull requests* (PRs), also known as *merge requests*. When you create a PR, you inform your team that a change is ready for review, and you and your team can take a look at each other’s code changes, and provide and address feedback before merging branches.\n\n\n\nIf you develop code as a team, or if you work on several changes at the same time, a common practice to follow is to use separate branches for each change and then create PRs to receive code reviews from your peers. This introduces another verification step that helps you identify errors before they become serious issues.\n\nXcode allows you to create, view, and comment on PRs, and merge changes into your codebase if you host your Git repository with [https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/product\/enterprise], [https:\/\/github.com], or [https:\/\/github.com\/enterprise].\n\n\n\nYou can also configure Xcode Cloud to detect new PRs, or changes to an existing PR. When it detects a change, Xcode Cloud merges the involved branches in a temporary build environment, and automatically builds your project and runs your tests to verify the merged code. After verifying the changes, Xcode Cloud adds a status message to the PR to inform you of the result.",
