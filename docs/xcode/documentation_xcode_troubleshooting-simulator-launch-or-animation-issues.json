This usually occurs when launching a simulator exceeds either the maximum number of active processes or the maximum number of open files. The best solution is to free up resources by closing simulated devices and other Mac applications.\n\nIf it’s not possible to free up enough resources, raise the system limits until you restart your Mac.\n\nFirst, find the current process and file limits:\n\nRun the command `ps -A | wc -l` in Terminal to show the current total of running processes.\n\nIf you need to increase the maximum number of processes, run the command `sudo launchctl limit maxproc <per user limit> <total limit>`, replacing `<per user limit>` and `<total limit>` with numbers. For example, the command `sudo launchctl limit maxproc 2000 2500` sets the maximum number of concurrent processes for any one user to 2000 and the total number of all concurrent processes to 2500.\n\nIf you need to increase the maximum number of open files, run the command `sudo launchctl limit maxfiles <per process limit> <total limit>`, replacing `<per process limit>` and `<total limit>` with numbers.
