  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen you’re testing your app, taking screenshots, or inspecting your user interface, you may want to configure Simulator to help accomplish your task. There are several options you can adjust:\n\nWhen you need to test your app after a device restart, or you want to simulate loading your app in a new device, you can restart or reset a simulated device.\n\n### Toggle between the light and dark appearances\n\nTest your app in both the light and dark appearances on supported platforms to confirm that your user interface looks correct for both appearances. To switch appearances, choose Features > Toggle Appearance.\n\n### Resize a simulator window\n\nYou can change the size of the window to match the physical device characteristics. For example, display the same number of pixels as the hardware device’s screen to check alignment of controls, images, and colors used in your app.\n\nTo change the window size to the hardware device’s screen size, choose Window > Physical size.\n\nTo change the window size to the same scale factor as the physical device, choose Window > Point Accurate.\n\nTo change the window size to the same number of pixels as the physical device, choose Window > Pixel Accurate.\n\nAlternatively, hold the pointer over a corner of the window until it changes to the resize cursor, then drag the window frame to the desired size.\n\n### Show the simulator bezel\n\nThe simulator bezel for iOS and watchOS devices includes elements for the buttons and switches found on those devices that you can click to simulate pressing.\n\nSelect a simulator window, then choose Window > Show Device Bezels to show or hide the simulator bezel. A checkmark next to Show Device Bezels indicates the bezel is visible.\n\n### Set the audio input and output\n\nSet the audio input and audio output that simulated devices use.\n\nTo set audio input, choose a device from the I\/O > Audio Input submenu. Choose System to use the same audio input as the Mac.\n\nTo set audio output, choose a device from the I\/O > Audio Output submenu. Choose System to use the same audio output as the Mac.\n\nTo adjust audio volume choose I\/O > Increase Volume or I\/O > Decrease Volume.\n\nSimulator keeps track of the most recent selections for input and for output. Simulator attempts to connect to the previously selected device when the currently selected device is disconnected.\n\n### Restart or reset a simulated device\n\nRestart a simulated device to simulate turning off and turning back on a device. To do this, choose Device > Restart.\n\nReset a simulated device to factory settings to clear out all installed apps and any data you may have added to the simulated device. To do this, choose Device > Erase All Contents and Settings…, and then choose Erase from the confirmation dialog.",
