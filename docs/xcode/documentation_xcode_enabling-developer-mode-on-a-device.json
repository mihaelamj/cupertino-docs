The feature doesn’t affect ordinary installation techniques, like buying apps from the App Store or participating in a TestFlight team. Instead, Developer Mode focuses on scenarios like performing a Build and Run in Xcode, or installing an `.ipa` file with [https:\/\/support.apple.com\/apple-configurator]. In these cases, the device explicitly asks the person using it to confirm that they’re a developer, aware of the risks of installing development-signed software.\n\n### Enable Developer Mode\n\nTo build and run your app on an iOS, visionOS, or watchOS device, you need to pair your device with Xcode and enable Developer Mode on the device. Xcode displays a message when you need to enable Developer Mode if you choose the device as the run destination, click the Run button, or select the device in the Devices and Simulators window.\n\nTo enable Developer Mode, first choose the device as the run destination and click the Run button. If a dialog appears stating that the device must opt into Developer Mode, click Cancel. Then open the Privacy & Security settings on the device and tap the Developer Mode option that appears under Security. On a watchOS device, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode. The Developer Mode option appears after the first time you try to run your app from Xcode on the device.\n\n\n\nToggle the Developer Mode switch to the on position. Settings displays an alert to warn you that Developer Mode reduces the security of your device. To continue enabling Developer Mode, tap the Restart button in the alert.\n\nAfter the device restarts and you unlock it, the device shows an alert confirming that you want to enable Developer Mode. To acknowledge the reduction in security protection in exchange for allowing Xcode and other tools to execute code, tap Enable, and when the next prompt appears, enter your device passcode.\n\nNow you can install and run apps from Xcode on the device. After the first time you enable Developer Mode, Xcode doesn’t ask you to enable it again unless you disable Developer Mode or restore the device.\n\n### Disable Developer Mode\n\nTo disable Developer Mode on the device, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode and tap Developer Mode. Toggle the Developer Mode switch to the off position. After you disable Developer Mode, you can’t run apps from Xcode on the device until you enable Developer Mode again.",
