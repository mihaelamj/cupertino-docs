  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn iOS app that’s able to display point-to-point directions can register as a routing app and make those directions available to Maps along with all other apps on a user’s device. Registering as a routing app improves the user experience because other apps can access your app’s routing information, and these apps don’t need to provide their own routing directions. Because Maps displays apps in the App Store that provide directions, registering your iOS app as a routing app is a great way to let users know about it.\n\nA routing app provides specific directions in addition to what Maps supports, such as subway routes, hiking trails, and bike paths. Before you can select the routing modes that your app supports, follow the steps in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability] to add the Maps capability to your app’s target.\n\n\n\n### Select the supported routing modes\n\nBefore the system can distribute requests for directions to your routing app, you must inform it of the routing modes your app supports by following these\nsteps:\n\n\n\nXcode adds the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/MKDirectionsApplicationSupportedModes] array to your app’s `Info.plist` file (if not already present) and uses the modes you select to populate the array with the necessary values.\n\nAfter you select the necessary routing modes, there are additional configuration steps you must complete before your app can start providing point-to-point directions, such as specifying a directions request document type and declaring your app’s geographic region.
