A build scheme contains a list of targets to build, and any configuration and environment details that affect the selected action. For example, when you build and run an app, the scheme tells Xcode what launch arguments to pass to the app. Xcode provides default schemes for most targets, and you can customize those schemes or create new ones as needed.\n\nTo view your project’s current schemes, click the scheme name in the toolbar of your project window. Xcode displays a pop-up menu with a list of current schemes at the top, and commands to edit, create, and manage schemes at the bottom.\n\n\n\nTo view and modify your project’s current schemes, select Manage Schemes. For example, disable automatic creation of schemes for new targets, and change scheme attributes such as which project contains the scheme.

To speed up builds, Xcode executes as many tasks as possible in parallel, taking advantage of whatever resources are available. To ensure that products build correctly, Xcode serializes tasks when dependencies exist between them.

Some options are available for all build actions, but some options are specific to the current build action.

Enable these checks from the Diagnostics tab of your build scheme.\n\nThe following table lists the supported diagnostics.\n\n\n\nTo detect memory-related issues, Xcode supports the following diagnostics:\n\n- Malloc Scribble writes the value `0x55` to every byte of a released memory block. This action helps you detect code that accesses the released block.\n- Malloc Guard Edges adds guard pages before and after large allocations. These pages detect code writes beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory block.\n- Guard Malloc uses several techniques to crash your app at the point where a memory error occurs.\n- Zombie Objects detects code that tries to access an already released object.\n- Malloc Stack Logging captures function call stack information at the time of each memory allocation.\n- Memory Graph on Resource Exception captures information about your memory graph. You can view the information in the debugger.\n\n### Run tasks before or after scheme actions\n\nFor each action in your scheme, you can run scripts or send emails before or after Xcode performs that action using pre-actions and post-actions. For example, you might use a post-action to log test results to a custom server each time you run your code. Unlike build phases, Xcode executes your actions only when you select the appropriate command from the Product menu.\n\nTo add a pre-action or post-action:\n\n1. Click the disclosure triangle for the action.\n2. Select Pre-actions or Post-actions\n3. Click the Add button (+) and select the type of action to add.\n4. Configure the details of the action.\n\n\n\nFor script actions, Xcode exposes the build settings for one of the scheme’s selected targets. Use environment variables to access the values of those variables.
