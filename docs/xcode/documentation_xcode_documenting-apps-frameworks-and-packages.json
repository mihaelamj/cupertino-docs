The compiler builds documentation by combining in-source comments with extension files, articles, and other resources that live alongside your project in Xcode.\n\nThe compiler integrates directly with Xcode to enhance your existing workflow, including code completion, Quick Help, and more.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of DocC and how to use it to document frameworks and packages, please visit the documentation available at [https:\/\/www.swift.org\/documentation\/docc].\n\n### Build simple documentation from source comments\n\nFor DocC to compile your documentation, build your project. Xcode stores supplementary information about public APIs for frameworks, and internal APIs for app targets, alongside the compiled artifacts. DocC consumes that information and compiles the documentation into a DocC Archive. This process repeats for every framework or package your target depends on.\n\n\n\nTo build documentation for a project, choose Product > Build Documentation. DocC compiles the documentation and opens it in Xcode’s documentation viewer.\n\n\n\n### Build multi-language documentation\n\nDocC takes information from the Swift compiler and the Objective-C compiler and combines it to form a single documentation archive that displays documentation for both languages. For targets that contain both Swift and Objective-C code, DocC automatically builds multi-language documentation. Targets written in a single language but intended to be used by both Swift and Objective-C code can opt in to multi-language documentation output. To enable this, do the following:\n\n\n\n### Configure a richer documentation experience\n\nDocC combines the public API information from the Swift compiler and the Objective-C compiler with the contents of the documentation catalog to generate a much richer DocC Archive.\n\nTo add a documentation catalog to an existing project, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n### Incorporate documentation into your build process\n\nIn addition to building documentation on demand by choosing Product > Build Documentation, you can automatically compile documentation whenever you build a framework by enabling a build setting that DocC provides.\n\nTo enable the documentation compiler build setting, do the following:\n\n\n\nDocC also integrates with `xcodebuild`, which means you can build documentation from the command line.
