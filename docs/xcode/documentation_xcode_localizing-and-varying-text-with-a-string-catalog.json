  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYour app delivers the best experience when it runs well in a person’s locale and displays content in their native language. Supporting multiple languages is more than translating text. It includes handling plurals for nouns and units, as well as displaying the right form of text on specific devices.\n\n\n\nUse a string catalog to localize and translate all your app’s text in a visual editor right in Xcode. A string catalog automatically tracks all the localizable strings from your code, and keeps your translations in one place.\n\nUse string catalogs to host translations, vary strings that contain plurals for different regions and locales, and change how text appears on different devices.\n\n### Localize your app’s text\n\nBefore you can translate text, you need to make it localizable. This involves wrapping the user-facing strings in your app in constructs that make them translatable.\n\nIn SwiftUI, all string literals within a view are automatically localizable.\n\nMake general text localizable using the `String(localized:)` initializer. For apps targeting older platforms, use the `NSLocalizedString` macro.\n\nAdd comments to give context and assist localizers when translating your text. Alternatively, you can use coding intelligence later to generate comments after you create a string catalog.\n\nWhen your code isn’t running in the main bundle, use the `bundle` parameter to tell the system where to find the string at runtime. You can pass the explicit bundle name or pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/bundle()] macro to refer to the bundle that contains resources for the current target.\n\nTo refer to the main app, pass `Bundle.main`, which is also the default bundle.\n\n### Add a string catalog to your project\n\nTo add a string catalog to your project, choose File > New > File from Template.\n\nIn the sheet that appears, select the platform, enter `string` in the filter field, select String Catalog under Resource, and click Next. In the dialog that appears, accept the default name `Localizable`, choose the Resources folder in your project as the location, and click Create.\n\n\n\nIf your string catalog gets too big, you can create multiple string catalog files within a single Xcode project, and give each a unique name. Then choose which string catalog to use for each translation by passing the string catalog name to the `tableName` or `table` parameter to the respective localization API as follows:\n\n### Add your localizable text to the string catalog\n\nXcode automatically keeps your string catalog and app in sync each time you build your project. To populate your string catalog with the localizable text from your app, choose Product > Build. Xcode identifies strings in your app that support localization, and then adds them to your string catalog.\n\n\n\n### Review the source of localizable text in the assistant\n\nAfter you populate your string catalog, you can review the location of localizable text in your app before you add languages and translations.\n\nIn the Project navigator, select the string catalog file and choose Editor > Assistant. Then select a key in the catalog to see the source of the localizable text in the assistant.\n\n\n\nIf necessary, make edits to the localizable text in the source editor and choose Product > Build to update the string catalog.\n\nAlternatively, to jump to the text in the source editor, click the arrow button that appears next to a key when you hover over it in the string catalog.\n\n### Generate comments automatically\n\nYou can let Xcode automatically create comments for your localizable strings to provide more context for translators. Comments should describe the interface element, surrounding interface, placeholder content, and variables in the string.\n\nTo generate a comment for a specific key:\n\nYou can also enable automatic comment generation for all projects. In Xcode > Settings > Editing, turn on “Automatically generate string catalog comments.”\n\nLater, when you export your localization files, an “auto-generated” note appears next to any automatically generated comments to distinguish them from manually written comments.\n\n### Add variants for strings that contain plurals\n\nLanguages have different grammatical rules for handling plurals of nouns and units. For example, in English, you can return `1 item` when the value of `%lld` is `1`. And you can return `%lld items` for all other cases. Other languages can have fewer or more plural variants, depending on their region and locale.\n\nFirst localize the text in your app using the value the string is dependent on, using string interpolation.\n\nThen, add plural variants to the source localization to assist localizers when translating your text in other languages. When you add other languages, Xcode automatically adds the language-specific variations for those languages to the strings file too. For example, Xcode adds One and Other variants for English, and One, Few, Many, and Other variants for Russian.\n\nIn the string catalog editor, Control-click the key that contains variables and select Vary by Plural from the contextual menu.\n\n\n\nWhen you add plural variants, the system does the following:\n\nClick the language in the sidebar, click the text field in the Language column for each variation of that string key, and then enter the text for the system to use when that plural displays.\n\nWhen you run the app, the plural variants update based on the value of the interpolated string.\n\n### Vary strings by device\n\nWhen you need to alter the text that displays on a device due to the available space, or because it has a different interaction, use the Vary by Device option in the string catalog editor.\n\nFor example, suppose you want to display two different messages depending on whether your app is running on iPhone or a Mac.\n\nTo vary the text string based on device, select the string catalog file, along with the language and key representing the message you want to vary. Control-click the key, select Vary by Device, and then select the device you want to add a specific message for.\n\nEnter the text you want to display for that selected device, while retaining the existing text for all other devices. Add more devices if you need more variations.\n\nWhen the app runs on the selected device, the system displays the new message for that device.\n\n### Add languages to your project\n\nTo support multiple languages in your app, add additional languages to your project. For each language, select the string catalog in the Project navigator, click the Add button (+) near the bottom of the string catalog editor, and select a language from the pop-up menu.\n\nYou can also add and remove languages using the Info pane in the project editor. Under Localizations, click the Add button (+), or select a language and click the Remove button (-).\n\n### Add your translations using the string catalog editor\n\nIf you know the translations for the languages that you add, you can enter them directly in the string catalog editor. Otherwise, you can export the languages, send them to a third-party for translation, and then import them.\n\nTo enter translations, select the language (German in this example) that you want to add translations for in the sidebar. Then click the text field for each key in that language’s column and enter the translation for that key.\n\nNewly added strings that require translation appear with a New icon in the State column. When you add a translation, the New icon changes to a green checkmark. As you add translations, the percent symbol beside the language updates, displaying the translation percentage for that language. When a string catalog language reaches full translation, the percent symbol changes to a green checkmark.\n\n\n\nFor information about exporting and importing translations in Xcode, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/exporting-localizations] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/importing-localizations].\n\n### Test your translations\n\nTo test your translations in the simulator:\n\n\n\nYou can also navigate to Settings on the individual simulated device and change the deviceʼs language there. When your app runs, the translations for the selected language appear in the simulator.\n\nFor more information on testing localizations, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/previewing-localizations] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/testing-localizations-when-running-your-app].",
