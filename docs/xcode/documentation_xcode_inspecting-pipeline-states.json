Double-click a pipeline state to open it and view its associated properties in a table.\n\n\n\nIn the screenshot above, the name of the pipeline state, G-buffer Creation, appears above the table. To the right of the name, you can click the Reveal in Memory button or the Reveal in Timeline button to open the Memory viewer or the Performance timeline, respectively, which both highlight the pipeline state.\n\nThe table displays the properties of your pipeline state in a logical hierarchy.
