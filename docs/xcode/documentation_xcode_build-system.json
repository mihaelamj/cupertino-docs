Use your project settings to modify the build process and add tasks that you need to complete your builds.\n\n\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Configuring a new target in your project**: Configure your project to build a new product, and add the code and resources the product requires.\n- **Configuring a multiplatform app**: Share project settings and code across platforms in a single app target.\n\n## Build settings\n\n- **Configuring the build settings of a target**: Specify the options you use to compile, link, and produce a product from a target, and identify settings inherited from your project or the system.\n- **Adding a build configuration file to your project**: Specify your project’s build settings in plain-text files, and supply different settings for debug and release builds.\n- **Build settings reference**: A detailed list of individual Xcode build settings that control or change the way a target is built.\n- **Identifying and addressing framework module issues**: Detect and fix common problems found in framework modules with the module verifier.\n- **Understanding build product layout changes in Xcode**\n\n## Build customization\n\n- **Customizing the build schemes for a project**: Specify which targets to build, and customize the settings Xcode uses to build, run, test, and profile those targets.\n- **Customizing the build phases of a target**: Specify the tasks to perform during a build, including the source files to compile, the scripts to run, and the resources to include in the final product.\n- **Creating build rules for custom file types**: Tell Xcode how to build your project’s custom file types, and provide dependency information to optimize the build process for each file.\n- **Running custom scripts during a build**: Execute custom shell scripts during the build process, and run tools or other commands that your project requires.\n- **Running code on a specific platform or OS version**: Add conditional compilation markers around code that requires a particular family of devices or minimum operating system version to run.\n\n## Performance\n\n- **Configuring your project to use mergeable libraries**: Use mergeable dynamic libraries to get app launch times similar to static linking in release builds, without losing dynamically linked build times in debug builds.\n- **Improving the speed of incremental builds**: Tell the Xcode build system about your project’s target-related dependencies, and reduce the compiler workload during each build cycle.\n- **Improving build efficiency with good coding practices**: Shorten compile times by reducing the number of symbols your code exports and by giving the compiler the explicit information it needs.\n- **Building your project with explicit module dependencies**: Reduce compile times by eliminating unnecessary module variants using the Xcode build system.\n\n## Security and privacy\n\n- **Verifying the origin of your XCFrameworks**: Discover who signed a framework, and take action when that changes.\n- **Enabling enhanced security for your app**: Detect out-of-bounds memory access, use of freed memory, and other potential vulnerabilities.\n- **Creating enhanced security helper extensions**: Reduce opportunities for an attacker to target your app through its extensions.\n- **Adopting type-aware memory allocation**: Reduce the opportunities to treat pointers as data in your code.\n- **Conforming to Mach IPC security restrictions**: Avoid crashes and potentially insecure situations associated with Mach messages.\n\n## Xcode IDE\n\n- **Projects and workspaces**: Manage the code and resources you use to build apps, libraries, and other software for Apple platforms.\n- **Source control management**: Back up your files, collaborate with others, and tag your releases with Git source control support in Xcode.\n- **Capabilities**: Enable services that Apple provides, such as In-App Purchase, Push Notifications, Apple Pay, iCloud, and many others.\n- **Command-line tools**: Develop and customize your projects in Terminal.\n\n",
