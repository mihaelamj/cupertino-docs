Find the Wallet capability.\n5. Select the “Enable subset of pass types” option.\n6. Xcode enables all pass type identifiers by default; disable individual identifiers by unchecking their checkboxes.\n\n\n\nXcode updates the `com.apple.developer.pass-type-identifiers` array in the app’s entitlements file to include only the enabled pass type identifiers, and if present, removes the wildcard value.\n\nAfter enabling the required pass type identifiers, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PassKit\/PKPassLibrary\/passes()] method of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PassKit\/PKPassLibrary] to retrieve the passes accessible to your app, or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PassKit\/PKPassLibrary\/pass(withPassTypeIdentifier:serialNumber:)] to fetch a specific pass.
