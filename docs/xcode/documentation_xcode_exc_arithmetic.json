For example, the Swift standard library’s numeric types detect division by zero and produce a fatal error (`SIGTRAP` or `SIGILL`). Because division by zero in C is undefined behavior, it might produce an incorrect result instead of an error.\n\n## Exceptions\n\n- **EXC_BAD_ACCESS**: A bad access to memory terminated the process.\n- **EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)**: A bus error terminated the process, often because the process tried to access a misaligned or invalid address in memory, or due to a pointer authentication failure.\n- **EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)**: A memory segmentation fault terminated the process, often because the process tried to access an invalid or out-of-bounds address in memory.\n- **EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) and EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL)**: A trace trap or invalid CPU instruction interrupted the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.\n- **EXC_CRASH**: The process crashed.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)**: The process terminated because it received an abort signal.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGKILL)**: The operating system terminated the process, often because a background task violated a requirement, device resources were limited, or the user force quit the app.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGQUIT)**: Another processes terminated the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGSYS)**: A bad argument to a system call terminated the process.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGTERM)**: A software termination signal terminated the process.\n- **EXC_GUARD**: The process violated a guarded resource protection, often related to file descriptors.\n- **EXC_RESOURCE**: The operating system stopped the process because the process exceeded a limit on resource consumption, like CPU time or memory.\n\n",
