Check whether the GPU time for various tasks matches your expectation or exceeds the budget time.\n- Try overlapping GPU tasks. Apple GPUs run vertex, fragment, and compute tasks in parallel whenever possible. For example, independent render passes and compute passes can run in parallel. If you observe nonoverlapping work, check whether your GPU work is overserialized. Also, use concurrent compute passes wherever possible so dispatches that touch different resources can execute concurrently.\n- Avoid too many small passes. There’s setup time between passes, so having small passes adds latency.\n- Use the counters as insights for improving passes in the critical path. The counter tracks available below the GPU tracks show a few key performance metrics. Aim for higher occupancy with efficient GPU work. Use limiters as clues to offload some work to underutilized subsystems on the GPU. In addition, you can Control-click any pass in the Performance timeline and choose Reveal in Counters to view more detailed counters data for a pass. For more information on counters, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Finding-your-Metal-apps-GPU-occupancy] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Reducing-shader-bottlenecks].\n- Prioritize optimizing passes in the critical path. When inspecting a pass, you can focus on the running shaders in the aggregated shader track below the GPU track. In addition, you can Control-click any shader in the Performance timeline and choose Open Shader. In the Shader editor, you can find per-line shader profiling statistics for identifying hot spots.\n\n## Metal workload analysis\n\n- **Analyzing your Metal workload**: Investigate your app’s workload, dependencies, performance, and memory impact using the Metal debugger.\n- **Analyzing resource dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary work in your Metal app by understanding the relationships between resources.\n- **Analyzing memory usage**: Manage your Metal app’s memory usage by inspecting its resources.\n- **Analyzing Apple GPU performance using counter statistics**: Optimize performance by examining counters for individual passes and commands.\n- **Analyzing Apple GPU performance with performance heat maps**: Gain insights to SIMD group performance by inspecting source code execution.\n- **Analyzing Apple GPU performance using the shader cost graph**: Discover potential shader performance issues by examining pipeline states.\n- **Analyzing non-Apple GPU performance using counter statistics**: Optimize performance by examining counters for individual passes and commands.\n\n",
