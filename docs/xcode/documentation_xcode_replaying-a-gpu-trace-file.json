For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Capturing-a-Metal-workload-in-Xcode] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Capturing-a-Metal-workload-programmatically].\n\nTo replay a GPU trace file, open it in Xcode. Before clicking Replay, you can configure which device to use (if there’s more than one available), as well as configure whether to run with profiling.\n\n\n\n### Configure replay\n\nIf you have multiple devices, you need to select a device before you can replay the GPU trace file. Xcode automatically selects the most compatible device, but you can select a different device using the Device popover.\n\nYou can optionally enable the Profile GPU Trace option to have Xcode automatically profile after replaying. Profiling has an initial performance impact on the Metal debugger, so only enable this option when debugging your app’s performance. You can always profile later as needed.",
