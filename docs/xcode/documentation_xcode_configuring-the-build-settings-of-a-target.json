Build settings control every aspect of the build process, including how Xcode compiles your source files, how it links your executable, whether it generates debug information, and how it packages and distributes your code. Xcode has hundreds of build settings to support the tools and steps associated with the build process.\n\nMake changes to your project or target’s settings from the Build Settings tab or with build configuration files. The following image shows the Build Settings tab for a project.\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of build settings, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/build-settings-reference].\n\n### Search and filter the list of build settings\n\nTo find a specific build setting quickly, use the filters and Search field at the top of the Build Settings tab.\n\n### Configure the value of a build setting\n\nEach build setting has the following attributes.\n\nThe Build Settings tab displays a setting’s title or name, but not both. When titles are visible, choose Editor > Show Setting Names to display the names. When names are visible, choose Editor > Show Setting Titles to display the titles.\n\nWhen you find the setting you want to modify, click the value attribute and type the new value. Xcode applies a bold font to modified settings to help you find them later. To restore a setting’s original value, select it and press the Delete key. If you modified the setting from the Levels view, delete the setting at the level where you overrode the value. For example, if you overrode the setting in your project, delete the setting there, and not in a target belonging to that project.\n\nTo configure different values for debug and release builds, click a setting’s disclosure triangle to reveal the configuration-specific values, and make the changes there. If you modify a setting while its disclosure triangle is in the closed position, Xcode applies the change to both configurations.\n\nSome settings define their values in terms of other settings. For example, an attribute whose value is a path to a file might use the `BUILD_DIR` setting to specify part of the path. When a setting’s definition is visible, choose Editor > Show Values to see the computed final value — that is, the value without the environment variable. When the final value is visible, choose Editor > Show Definitions to see the definition.\n\n### Evaluate how your project inherits settings\n\nEvery target inherits settings from both its parent project and the platform SDK. This inheritance model ensures that the target starts with valid baseline settings. When you create a target, Xcode changes some settings based on the target type, and you are free to make other changes based on your needs.\n\nTo help you track down the source of a setting’s value, open the build settings for your project or target and select the Levels filter. Xcode displays the current settings hierarchy in the build settings editor. This hierarchy includes the default SDK values and any other project or target values that are active. The Resolved column shows the final resolved value Xcode uses to build the item.\n\n\n\nWith levels displayed, highlighted values indicate values that take precedence. Xcode uses a target’s build settings before referring to build settings you define for the project. At each level, Xcode gives precedence to settings you provide in the project over those you provide in build configuration files. Xcode gives the lowest precedence to the default system values. The hierarchy of precedence is:\n\n### Obtain additional details about a build setting\n\nTo see detailed information about a particular setting, select the setting and choose View > Inspectors > Quick Help.
