  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nHuman perception is very sensitive to interruptions in motion. When a fluid motion onscreen gets *stuck* for a short time, even a couple of milliseconds can be noticeable. This type of interruption is known as a *hitch*. Hitches happen during continuous interactions, like scrolling or dragging, or during animations. Each hitch impacts the user experience, so you want as few hitches as possible in your app.\n\nAn interruption in motion occurs when the display doesn’t update at the expected pace. The display doesn’t update in time when the next frame isn’t ready for display, so the frame is late.\n\nA delay due to a late frame often causes the system to skip one or more subsequent frames, which is why such behavior is also referred to as a *frame drop*. However, dropping a frame is just one potential response the system uses to recover from a late frame, and not every hitch causes a frame drop.\n\nWhen a frame is late, it’s usually due to a delay occurring somewhere in the render loop. These delays are the result of a delay in the main thread, most often in the commit phase, known as a *commit hitch*, or a delay in the render phase, known as a *render hitch*.\n\n### Understand the render loop\n\nWhereas the main thread handles only a single event at a time, the render loop prepares a frame in multiple stages. Although each stage processes only one frame at a time, all stages work together on multiple frames in parallel. Each stage has a tight deadline to hand off its frame to the next stage to ensure it’s ready for the screen refresh.\n\n\n\nA display updating at a 120 Hz refresh rate updates 120 times per second, or every 8.3 ms. That means the app needs to update the UI every 8.3 ms, and render a new frame every 8.3 ms. By default, each stage then has up to 8.3 ms to do its work as well.\n\nEven a few milliseconds of additional delay can cause a stage to miss its deadline. Even though the render server is a separate process, it performs work on behalf of the app, and this work may be too complex to finish in time. To find and understand hitches, you need to look at the work on the main thread *and* the work on the render server.\n\n### Understand the display refresh interval and associated deadlines\n\nApple devices update their displays at a regular, but variable, refresh rate. During user interaction, a display updates at the maximum refresh rate the device supports. When there’s nothing new to display, some displays reduce the refresh rate. The point in time when the display updates is called the *vertical sync* or *vsync*. Whenever a vsync occurs, the new frame needs to be ready so the display driver can start to update the pixels of the display.\n\nSo for each frame, the render loop targets a specific vsync in the future to display the new frame, which is called the *presentation time*. It then calculates intermediate deadlines backward from there. The render loop operates in multiple stages with individual deadlines, starting with the UI update in your app’s main thread.\n\n\n\nYour app’s main thread handles the event and computes a new UI update. The UI framework collects all the changes to the UI and sends the new state over to the render server, which is referred to as the *Core Animation commit*. Unlike hangs in discrete interaction, where only a delay on the order of 100 ms or more on the main thread becomes noticeable, people are much more sensitive to interruptions in fluid motion. Even a few milliseconds of delay can cause the main thread work to miss the commit deadline, resulting in a noticeable hitch.\n\nImmediately after the commit deadline, the render server starts working to transform your app’s UI representation into a bitmap to display onscreen. The render server does this in two steps:\n\nAfter the render server finishes rendering, during the next vsync interval, the display driver reads from the prepared render buffer, and uses that information to update the screen.\n\nThere are three important times in this process: the presentation time, the commit deadline, and the begin time. These times usually, but not always, align with the vsyncs of the underlying display, meaning that the presentation time is at a given vsync, the commit deadline is a vsync before that, and the begin time is a vsync before the commit deadline.\n\nAlthough the render server starts work immediately after the commit deadline, and the display driver starts updating the display with a vsync, the other work isn’t necessarily in alignment with these times. The render server’s work might finish before the presentation time, in which case, it waits until the next commit deadline to start work on the next frame.\n\nDepending on the platform, the work on the main thread may or may not align with the begin time or the commit deadline. To reduce input delays, the system may process events as soon as they come in, depending on the rendering mode, the input device, and the platform. Alternatively, the system might hold events and only deliver them to the app’s main thread at the begin time to maximize the time the app has to compute the UI update for the next frame before the next commit deadline. Regardless of when work on a frame actually starts, the begin time is the earliest time the system can start work for the frame.\n\nAlthough the app itself works on only a single frame at a time, the individual stages of the rendering loop can happen in parallel. So while the display is displaying a given frame, and the render server is rendering the next frame, the app can start work on the frame after that.\n\n\n\nAs such, the deadlines are all relative to an individual frame. One frame’s commit deadline is the begin time of the next frame.\n\n\n\nAlthough the begin time and the commit deadline often align with a vsync, this isn’t always the case. For example, for variable refresh rate displays, the refresh rate might change during the runtime of your app, causing these times to be out of sync with the display updates. Devices can also switch to a low-latency mode, where the time the render server spends on a frame is less than one vsync interval, so the app attempts to process events as quickly as possible to minimize delays between a user input and a screen update, such as in drawing apps.\n\n### Understand frame lifetime and hitch duration\n\nMost Apple devices operate in a double-buffer mode, meaning that the render server and the display driver share two buffers. The display driver uses one buffer to read pixel values for the screen, and the render server uses the other buffer to render the next frame for display. When the vsync occurs, the render server and the display driver switch buffers. So the display driver uses the newly rendered buffer to update the screen, and the render server renders a new frame into the buffer that the display driver used for the previous frame.\n\nBecause it can take up to one vsync interval for the display driver to update all pixels on the screen, the time between triggering a display update and updating the last pixel onscreen is three vsync intervals — one on the main thread, one on the render server, and one on the display driver. However, the app’s main thread and the render server each have only a single vsync interval to finish their work. An individual vsync interval can be as short as 16.7 ms for a 60 Hz refresh rate (1s\/60), or 8.3 ms for a 120 Hz refresh rate (1s\/120). This means that in double-buffer mode, the delay between the app beginning work on a screen update and the screen actually updating is 50 ms at 60 Hz, or 25 ms at 120 Hz, but each individual frame only stays onscreen for one-third of that time.\n\nThe *expected frame lifetime* is the time between the begin time and the presentation time, which is the time the app and the render server have to perform their work on the frame. The *actual frame lifetime* starts at the begin time and ends with the vsync that swaps the frame onto the display. Neither of these frame lifetimes includes the time the display driver takes to update the screen. Because of this, although the expected delay between the app beginning work and the last pixel onscreen updating is three vsync intervals, the expected frame lifetime only measures the first two intervals.\n\nWhen everything operates correctly, the expected frame lifetime and the actual frame lifetime are the same. When the actual frame lifetime is longer than the expected frame lifetime, the new frame doesn’t appear onscreen in time, so the previous frame needs to stay onscreen longer than expected, and a hitch occurs. The difference between the actual frame lifetime and the expected frame lifetime is called the *hitch duration*, which is the amount of time the frame is late. So in the illustration below, the hitch duration is one vsync interval, or 16.7 ms for a 60 Hz refresh rate.\n\n\n\nDepending on various circumstances, rendering can also happen in triple-buffer mode. Triple-buffer mode works like double-buffer mode except that at any point in time, the render server may be working on the next two frames in parallel, and may use two separate buffers to do so, while the display driver displays a third frame onscreen.\n\n\n\nIn triple-buffer mode, the app still needs to finish all work within a single vsync interval, but the render server has two vsync intervals to finish its work, and can work on two frames in parallel. In this mode, the delay between the begin time and the presentation time of a frame — the expected frame lifetime — is three vsync intervals, or 25 ms at 120 Hz, and 50 ms at 60 Hz. Accordingly, the delay between the app beginning work on a frame and the last pixel onscreen updating is four vsync intervals, or 33.3 ms at 120 Hz, and 66.7 ms at 60 Hz. Although the delay is longer than in double-buffer mode, no frame arrives later than expected. The display updates at its expected refresh rate and displays a new frame at every vsync, enabling fluid motion onscreen.\n\n### Understand commit hitches and render hitches\n\nThe work to update the screen consists of two parts — the work that the app’s process performs and the work that the render server performs. And because each chunk of work has its own deadline, you can differentiate different types of hitches. In the Commit Hitch illustration above, the app’s process doesn’t meet the commit deadline, which causes the render server to start one vsync later, resulting in a hitch. Because the app process is responsible for this hitch — the Core Animation commit doesn’t finish in time for the vsync — this is called a *commit hitch*.\n\nAlthough the time that the display driver needs to update the pixels onscreen from a render buffer is the same no matter how complex the UI is, this isn’t the case for the render server. A complex render request can cause the render server to take longer than the available time, resulting in a missed deadline. When the work in the app process finishes on time, but the work on the render server doesn’t, it’s called a *render hitch*.\n\nOne of the reasons the system may switch to triple buffering is to recover from a render hitch. In the illustration below, the render server doesn’t render the green frame within one vsync interval, so the rendering isn’t complete by presentation time. In response, the render server uses a third frame buffer and switches to triple-buffer mode to start rendering the next frame while the GPU finishes work on the previous frame. This avoids dropping the green frame, but it’s still onscreen one vsync later than scheduled, which might cause a perceptible interruption in motion, resulting in a hitch.\n\n\n\nIn the following illustration, the frame’s actual frame lifetime is also three vsyncs because the render server is operating in triple-buffer mode. This is expected, and it isn’t a hitch because it manages to update the screen on each vsync going forward.\n\n\n\nThe system can also use the triple-buffer mode during regular operation for various reasons, such as to save energy by running the GPU in a low-power mode and giving it more time to finish, or when a specific use case needs more time to render on the CPU and GPU than is available in a single vsync interval.\n\nThe preparation step of the rendering occurs on the CPU, and the actual rendering occurs on the GPU. Although the GPU can perform the work in parallel, the CPU can’t. Therefore, even in triple-buffer mode, the render server’s CPU work still needs to complete within a single vsync interval to avoid starting on the next frame’s CPU work late, and to give the GPU sufficient time to finish its work before the presentation time.\n\nEven though rendering occurs inside the render server and not in the app itself, a render hitch is usually due to the app, such as when the scheduled UI update is too complex to render in time. You need to pay attention to both commit hitches and render hitches. The type of hitch provides a hint to the underlying reason, as well as the part of your app you need to optimize to avoid the hitch in the future.",
