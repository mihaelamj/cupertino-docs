They bundle source files, binaries, and resources in a way that’s easy to use in your app’s project.\n\nXcode supports creating and publishing Swift packages, as well as adding, removing, and managing package dependencies. Its support for Swift packages is built on top of the open source Swift Package Manager project.\n\nTo learn more about the API you use in your package manifest, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PackageDescription\/Package].
