  "overview" : "## Overview\n\n*Source control* is the practice of tracking and managing changes to your code. Manage your Xcode project with source control to keep a rich history of the changes you make, and collaborate on code faster and more effectively.\n\nXcode simplifies source control management with its built-in support for Git. You create a Git *source control repository* that stores your project files and a history of your changes through *commits*. When a set of changes are ready, your reviewers verify them, make suggestions, and approve them. Then you can merge your changes into the repository.\n\nFor example, you create a branch for feature work, and after it’s approved, merge those changes into the main branch.\n\n",
