  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA person’s device maximizes its battery life by reducing its use of power-consuming subsystems when apps don’t require them. For example, when there aren’t any apps making a network request, the device can switch off its Wi-Fi and cellular components.\n\nWhen your app uses these features, it reduces the time the device lasts between charges and potentially increases the device’s temperature, which can cause the device to limit its function to avoid overheating. A person can see which apps use significant amounts of battery power by opening the Battery settings on their device. If the person sees that your app uses a lot of power and contributes to a poor overall experience using the device, they might choose to use your app less, or uninstall your app.\n\n\n\nGather information from Xcode, MetricKit, and Instruments to understand your app’s battery use, and identify and prioritize opportunities for improving your app’s performance.\n\n### Review your app’s energy use in Xcode\n\nThe Battery Usage pane in the Xcode Organizer shows a breakdown of the appʼs foreground and background power use by app version, giving you a starting place to optimize power consumption. The graph only includes app versions for which Xcode has sufficient information to display metrics.\n\nThe top graph shows the onscreen use, and the percentage of battery used, normalized to a 24-hour period while the app is in the foreground and the device isnʼt connected to power.\n\n\n\nThe bottom graph shows the background battery use during the same period.\n\nClicking on a bar for a previous version shows a comparison of battery use to the right of the graphs, as shown in the figure above. The percentage values for each version are followed by a category breakdown. The graph shows larger values in bold for easier comparison.\n\nThe power-use categories are:\n\n### Measure your running app’s power use in Xcode\n\nIn Xcode, set the run destination to a device and choose Product > Run. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device].\n\nIn the Debug navigator, show the debug gauges and click Energy Impact to see your app’s energy usage. The gauge shows the app’s average energy impact, and the pie chart shows how much each power use category contributes to energy use on the device. The timeline reports the instantaneous energy use associated with each category, along with the app’s life-cycle state and the device’s thermal condition.\n\n\n\n### Gather power metrics\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MetricKit] to receive metrics about how your app uses the battery on people’s devices. Understand your app’s battery use by gathering the following metrics:\n\n### Profile your app’s power use in Instruments\n\nUse the Power Profiler tool in Instruments to investigate your app’s battery use. You can use this tool to analyze data you collect during development, and data that someone sends you from a device on which they use your app. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/measuring-your-app-s-power-use-with-power-profiler].\n\n### Measure energy use in performance tests\n\nIf you identify that a particular part of your code contributes significantly to your app’s overall energy use through CPU-intensive activity, create a performance test that measures that code’s CPU use. Run the test regularly to detect regressions in your app’s CPU use, which may cause a corresponding increase in energy use.\n\nUse [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTCPUMetric] in your performance test to measure the CPU use of the code block in the test. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/writing-and-running-performance-tests].\n\n### Adopt recommended practices for minimizing battery use\n\nReduce the work your app does, and perform the remaining work in more efficient ways. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/reducing-your-app-s-battery-use].",
