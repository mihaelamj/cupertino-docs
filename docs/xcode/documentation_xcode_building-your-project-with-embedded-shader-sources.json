Select your project in the Project navigator, click the Build Settings tab, and search for the Produce Debugging Information setting in the Metal Compiler Build Options section. Then, change the setting’s Debug entry to “Yes, include source code.”\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can debug the shaders that you compile for release by generating a separate symbol file for each Metal library in your project.
