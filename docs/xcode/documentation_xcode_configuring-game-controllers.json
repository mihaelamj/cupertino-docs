Apple specifies the look and behavior of the controls to MFi accessory manufacturers, which means you can rely on a consistent set of high-quality controls in all supported game controllers.\n\nA game that supports game controllers enables one or more different *game-controller profiles* — objects that map physical controls on a device to the inputs your game requires — such as Extended, Micro, and Directional. The game also specifies the preferred order of use for these profiles. After retrieving a profile from the connected game controller, your game periodically requests the device’s current values or installs handlers that the system invokes when those values change.\n\nBefore you can select the profiles your game supports, follow the steps in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability] to add the Game Controllers capability to your game’s target.\n\n\n\nAfter you add the Game Controllers capability to your game’s target, Xcode appends the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/GCSupportsControllerUserInteraction] key to its `Info.plist` file with a value of `true` to indicate to the system that your game supports game controllers.\n\n### Select the supported game controller profiles\n\nWhen you add support for game controllers to your app, you don’t integrate with specific hardware. Instead, you integrate one or more of the game-controller profiles that the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/GameController] framework provides.
