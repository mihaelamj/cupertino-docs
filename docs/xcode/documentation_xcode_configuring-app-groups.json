Conversely, uncheck a group’s checkbox to revoke your app’s membership.\n\nTo create an app group for your app, perform the following:\n\n1. Click the Add button (+) below the App Groups list.\n2. Enter a container ID in the dialog that appears. A container ID must begin with `group.` and then a custom string.\n3. Click OK to save the new app group.\n\n\n\nXcode automatically selects the new app group in the App Groups list; this selection indicates that your app is now a member of that app group.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Access an app group’s shared container\n\nWhen your app becomes a member of an app group, there are a number of APIs you can use to read and write data to that group’s shared container, such as:\n\n- Sharing preferences and other limited data by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UserDefaults\/init(suiteName:)] method to access the app group’s shared user defaults database.\n- Retrieving the physical location of the app group’s shared container by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)] method, which you can later use to read and write data.\n- Set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/URLSessionConfiguration\/sharedContainerIdentifier] property on the configuration of a background URL session to download files directly into the app group’s shared container.\n\nYou can also use an app group, which has an identifier that starts with the `group.` prefix, as a Keychain Access Group.
