  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA target specifies a product to build, such as an app, framework, app extension, or unit test. A project can contain multiple targets, usually representing related parts of a single product. For example, a project might contain separate targets for an app, a private framework, an app extension, and a suite of tests.\n\nWhen you create a new project from a template, Xcode adds one or more targets to the project automatically. For example, the multiplatform app template contains separate targets for an iOS app and Mac app.\n\n\n\nTo view the targets in a project, select the project in the navigator area. The editor area displays the current project and target information. Select a target to view general information about it, and to view its current build settings and capabilities. Changes you make to a target’s configuration affect that target only. Changes you make to the project affect all targets.\n\n### Add a new target to your project\n\nAdd new targets to create separate products in your project, augment an existing app using app extensions, or factor code into a private framework. You can also add new apps, system extensions, test suites, and other types of targets to your project.\n\nTo add a new target:\n\n\n\nYou can embed some types of targets, directly into the bundle of an existing app. This option simplifies the setup process for frameworks, app extensions, and other products that you plan to ship inside your app. When you embed a target, Xcode configures the necessary project settings to build the target and copy it into your app. Xcode also creates the necessary dependencies to ensure that the targets build in the proper order.\n\n### Add source files and other content to a target\n\nTarget templates contain default files to help you start development. Choose File > New to create new files and embed them directly into an existing target. To assign an existing file to a new target, select the file and update its membership attributes in the Identity inspector.\n\n\n\nFor more information about how to add files to a project, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/managing-files-and-folders-in-your-xcode-project].\n\n### Configure a dependency between two targets\n\nDependencies tell Xcode the correct order in which to build a set of targets. Xcode builds targets in parallel when it can, but sometimes it must build targets serially. For example, Xcode must build a custom framework before it builds an app that links against that framework. When you embed a new target inside an app, Xcode creates a dependency between the app and target if the scheme’s Find Implicit Dependencies option is enabled. If that option is disabled, you must configure the dependency yourself.\n\nTo view and add dependencies, select a target and open its build phase settings. The Dependencies build phase contains the targets that Xcode must successfully build before it builds the current target. Xcode can build multiple dependent targets simultaneously if there are no interdependencies between those targets.\n\n\n\nWhen there’s a relationship between targets that Xcode can’t easily detect, add dependencies manually. While Xcode can add dependencies automatically when the Find Implicit Dependencies build scheme option is enabled, it can’t detect all dependencies. For example, Xcode can’t detect when a target relies on data files built by a custom script in another target. If you don’t specify a needed dependency, Xcode might report errors or build the targets incorrectly.\n\nFor more information on optimizing your targets to improve build times, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/improving-the-speed-of-incremental-builds].",
