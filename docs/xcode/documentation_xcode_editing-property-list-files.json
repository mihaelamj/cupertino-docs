  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nYou use property list files to provide the system with structured data about your apps and other code bundles. For example, every bundle contains an Xcode-managed [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List] that describes the bundle to the system. Additionally, many apps contain property lists that describe their [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/privacy-manifest-files] that describe the data they collect and how they use certain APIs.\n\nBy default, Xcode generates your bundle’s information property list file from values in your project’s build settings, which you manage using the Info pane in the project editor, and you don’t need to edit the file directly. If you need to, you can supply a file that you edit manually. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/managing-your-app-s-information-property-list].\n\nSimilarly, Xcode manages your app or extension’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements] file, based on [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/capabilities] you add to your target using the Signing & Capabilities pane in the target editor, and you typically don’t need to edit the entitlements property list file directly. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app].\n\nWhen you manually create a property list file, use the Xcode property list editor to update the file’s content while ensuring that the structure is valid.\n\n### Create a property list file\n\nTo create a property list file in Xcode, follow these steps:\n\nTo create a privacy manifest file, select the App Privacy template from the Resource group instead. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/privacy-manifest-files#Create-a-privacy-manifest].\n\n### Add a property to the file\n\nTo add a property to a property list file, open the file in the Xcode editor, hover over the title of the file, and click the Add button (+) that appears next to the title. Type the name of the key and press Enter, or click outside of the text field.\n\nYou can also add an entry at any level of the property list file by hovering over an existing entry and clicking on the Add button (+) that appears.\n\n\n\nIf the existing entry’s value has a primitive type — for example, a string, number, or Boolean — then Xcode creates the new entry as a key at the same level in the file’s structure as the existing entry, or as a new element in the same array if the existing entry is an element in an array.\n\nIf the existing entry’s value has a collection type — a dictionary or an array — then the behavior depends on whether the value is disclosed or hidden. If the value is disclosed, Xcode creates the new entry as a key-value pair inside the value if it’s a dictionary, or a new element in the array if it’s an array. Otherwise, Xcode creates the new entry as a key-value pair at the same level in the file’s structure as the existing entry.\n\n### Set the type and value for a property\n\nXcode tracks the schema for common property list files, including information property lists and privacy manifest files, and sets the correct type for a key when you add the key to the file.
