  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe Performance Statistics viewer displays counters to help you understand the automatically generated insights for hotspots and bottlenecks so you can improve GPU performance. GPU performance counters are granular statistics that relate to the specific render, compute, or blit work your app performed in the captured frame.\n\n\n\n### Show columns for performance counters\n\nControl-click a column header to show and hide counter value columns for median, maximum, and total values. You can view the following columns:\n\n### Check counters data for anomalies\n\nMove the pointer over a counter to reveal its description.\n\n\n\nBy analyzing values that may be hotspots, counters can suggest a specific cause of your app’s performance problem. For example, if the number of vertices is twice as high as you expect, it’s likely that your code has duplicate meshes or render encoder draw calls.\n\n### Limit your scope with filters\n\nUse the filter field at the bottom of the table to adjust filtering criteria by typing filter terms into it. The table shows individual counters and groups of counters with names that match those filter terms.\n\nWhen there are two or more filter terms, you can click the filter button to choose whether to match any or all of the terms. For any filter term, you can click it to choose to include or exclude counters that match the term.",
