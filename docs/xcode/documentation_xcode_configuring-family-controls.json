  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe Family Controls framework enables your app to use Screen Time API app extensions to implement parental controls through the Managed Settings and Device Activity frameworks. For more information on the Screen Time APIs, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ScreenTimeAPIDocumentation].\n\nTo enable the Family Controls functionality, add the capability to your target. Xcode automatically updates your app target’s entitlements file to include the `com.apple.developer.family-controls` entitlement key set to `true`, and you can access the entitlement through the Apple Developer Program during development. Configure it for the App ID of your app and its Screen Time API app extensions under the Capabilities tab in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/resources\/identifiers\/list].\n\n### Add the Family Controls capability to your target\n\nTo add the capability to your app’s target, follow the steps in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability] section of [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app], then select Family Controls from Xcode’s Capabilities library. If you add a new target in your Xcode project using a Screen Time API extension template such as Device Activity Monitor, Device Activity Report, Shield Action, or Shield Configuration, Xcode enables Family Controls automatically. This capability is available on iOS and visionOS. \n\nIf you remove the Family Controls capability in Xcode, disable this capability for your app’s App ID in Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles, [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/provisioning-profiles\/edit-download-or-delete-profiles#regenerate-a-provisioning-profile], and re-sign your app with this profile.\n\n### Add the Family Controls entitlement key\n\nWhen you add the Family Controls capability, Xcode automatically updates your app target’s entitlements file to include the `com.apple.developer.family-controls` entitlement key set to `true`:\n\nIf your app target doesn’t include an entitlements file, remove then re-add the Family Controls capability.\n\n### Update your provisioning profile\n\nAfter you add the Family Controls capability to your app’s target in Xcode, generate a provisioning profile, and re-sign your app with the profile. Use automatic signing to let Xcode manage signing for you. If you use automatic signing, Xcode automatically enables Family Controls for your app’s App ID in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/resources\/identifiers\/list] and requests a new provisioning profile for your app. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/provisioning-profiles\/edit-download-or-delete-profiles].\n\nIf you manually sign your app, enable the Family Controls capability for your app’s App ID in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/resources\/identifiers\/list], then [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/provisioning-profiles\/edit-download-or-delete-profiles#regenerate-a-provisioning-profile]. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/identifiers\/enable-app-capabilities]. After you regenerate the profile, download it or select Download Profile from the Provisioning Profile dropdown menu in Xcode to install it. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/distributing-your-app-to-registered-devices].\n\nIf your app includes a Screen Time API extension, use the same steps to update the provisioning profile of the extension.\n\n### Request the Family Controls entitlement\n\nTo distribute your app, you need an entitlement that enables distribution. When you submit your app to TestFlight and the App Store, request permission to use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.family-controls] entitlement. This entitlement supports provisioning profiles for development, Ad Hoc, and App Store distribution. If your app includes a Screen Time API app extension, submit the same request for the extension.",
