  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA mature project benefits from many tests that cover a variety of scenarios. Tests can verify code behavior or measure performance; they can test different products, or the same product on different targets or configurations. They can be long-running UI tests that exercise complex workflows or small unit tests that exercise individual functions, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/testing].\n\nControl the information you receive from your tests at different stages in the software engineering process by organizing these tests into test plans, and configuring how Xcode executes the test plans. For example, you can create a test plan to run only the unit tests for a module while developing and debugging that module, and a second test plan to run all unit, integration, and UI tests before submitting your app to the App Store.\n\n\n\nWith [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing], you can declare and add *tags*, annotations that identify tests that share common characteristics, to your tests.\n\nYou might add tags to specify:\n\nIn Xcode 16 and later, you can use tags in your test plans to specify which tests to include. For more information about declaring tags and adding tags to test, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing\/AddingTags]. For more information about migrating your existing unit test to Swift Testing, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing\/MigratingFromXCTest].\n\n### Create schemes to associate test targets with products\n\nA scheme instructs Xcode to use specific targets when you invoke the building, testing, running, analyzing, profiling, and archiving actions, shown in the figure below. In the test action for a scheme, include the target for the product under test along with the test targets that contain tests relevant to that product.\n\n\n\nFor information on creating Xcode schemes and assigning targets to schemes, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project].\n\nIf your product has multiple targets — like an iOS app that contains a static library and a widget extension — create a scheme for each of the individual targets in addition to an “umbrella” scheme that builds the whole product suitable for release. Developers on your team can use the more specific scheme when working on tasks in each target, running only the tests relevant to that target to get faster feedback. When they are ready to integrate their changes, developers can get better assurance that they have not introduced regressions by running the complete collection of tests in the umbrella scheme.\n\n### Create test plans to organize the tests for a scheme\n\nA *test plan* is a document in your Xcode project that describes which tests Xcode should run when a developer invokes the test action, shown in the figure below, and the configurations Xcode uses to run the tests.\n\n\n\nYou can create multiple test plans for the same scheme and use any of them when running tests from Xcode or in Terminal. You must choose one test plan as the default plan for the scheme; Xcode uses this plan to run tests when none is explicitly specified. Xcode creates a default test plan that includes all of the tests from the test targets built by your scheme.\n\n\n\nTo edit this test plan, choose Product > Scheme > Edit Test Plan. Xcode prompts you for a location to save the test plan.\n\nTo create additional test plans:\n\nTo select the default test plan for the current scheme:\n\n\n\n### Include or exclude tests from a test plan\n\nSpecify the test targets to use, along with any tags Xcode should use to determine which tests to include or exclude from a test plan:\n\n\n\nTo include all your tests in the test plan, leave the Include Tags and  Exclude Tags fields empty.\n\n### Choose the test suites and functions to run in a test plan\n\nTo further filter the tests that Xcode runs for a given test plan, select the checkbox in the Included column next to an item in the test plan’s outline view. You can select or deselect any item that matches the conditions from the Include Tags and Exclude Tags fields. The items represent targets, suites, functions, and specific input parameters passed to parameterized test functions. Xcode displays the symbol names for tags under the Tags column next to the suites and functions they annotate. Hold the pointer over an item to display a right arrow button. Click the button to display the source code for that item in the Source editor.\n\nIf you exclude a test function or test case from a test plan, Xcode skips over the test function or test case and doesn’t provide feedback on their status. The only effect an excluded test function has on the outcome of the test action is if the test contains a build error, in which case the whole test action fails.\n\nSwift Testing and XCTest support ways to modify the effect a test has on the outcome of a test action while still running it. In Swift Testing you use traits to control the runtime conditions under which test should run, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing\/EnablingAndDisabling] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing\/known-issues] to indicate tests you expect to fail. To skip a test because the execution platform or configuration is inappropriate for the test in XCTest, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTSkipIf(_:_:file:line:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTSkipUnless(_:_:file:line:)]. To indicate that a test is expected to fail in XCTest, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTExpectFailure(_:options:)].\n\n### Adjust configurations for test plans\n\nEach test plan contains one or more configurations that tell Xcode how to set up the runtime environment for the tests. In the Configurations tab of the test plan editor, shown in the figure below, you can set environment variables, enable additional checks such as the address sanitizer and memory management guards, and choose different localization settings for the code.\n\n\n\nThe values you can specify in a test plan configuration are:\n\nFor more information on the address sanitizer, thread sanitizer, undefined behavior sanitizer, and main thread checker, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/diagnosing-memory-thread-and-crash-issues-early].\n\nTo create additional test plan configurations, click the Add button. Xcode runs the tests specified in a test plan once for each of that plan’s configurations.\n\n### Add a test plan to a scheme\n\nYou can associate a test plan with more than one scheme, to get the same test suites and functions included with the same configurations in multiple schemes. To add an existing test plan to a scheme, do the following:\n\n### Run the tests specified in a test plan in Xcode\n\nWhen Xcode runs the test action, it executes the tests in the active test plan once for each configuration in the test plan. To set the active test plan and run the tests specified in that plan, do the following:\n\nFor information about interpreting the results of tests in Xcode, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/running-tests-and-interpreting-results].\n\n### Run tests from the command-line\n\nTo run tests using a specific test plan from the command-line, you must explicitly name the test plan to use. To discover the test plans for `SampleApp`, run the following:\n\nTo run the tests specified in the “Performance Tests” test plan, run the following:\n\nTo run the tests in the “Performance Tests” test plan, using only the configuration called “My Config”, run the following:\n\nTo run the tests in the “Performance Tests” test plan, using all configurations except “My Config”, run the following:",
