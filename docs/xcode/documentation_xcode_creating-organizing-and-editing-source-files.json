  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nSet up your Xcode project window to efficiently edit multiple related files at the same time. While you edit, annotate your files so you can easily determine a file’s content with the minimap or jump bar. Then add comments that Xcode can present as Quick Help to make your code easier to understand.\n\nFor information about how to add files and folders to your project, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/managing-files-and-folders-in-your-xcode-project].\n\n### Edit related files using tabbed windows\n\nEdit related files together using tabbed windows in Xcode. To open a new window tab with the same configuration as your current window, press Command-T. To open existing files in tabs within a single window, select one or more files, and choose File > Open in New Window. Then choose Window > Merge All Windows.\n\n\n\nNext, configure each tab for how you plan to use it. To give each tab a name that describes how you use it, choose Window > Rename Window Tab.\n\nInside a window or window tab, configure the workspace for your task:\n\nFrom the navigators, click a file to open it in the editor area. Xcode displays the filename in italics on the tab, indicating that the next file you click opens in the same tab. Double-click a file to open it in a new tab. Xcode displays the filename in regular text on the tab, indicating that the next file you click or double-click opens in a new tab.\n\n### Edit your source code\n\nTo open a source code file in the source editor, click the file in the Project navigator. Add code in the editor area. As you type, use code completion to assist with variable and function names.\n\n\n\nWhen you use code completion for a method or function with parameters, Xcode provides a placeholder for each parameter that you need to add. Navigate between the placeholders with Tab and Shift-Tab, or choose Navigate > Jump to Next Placeholder or Navigate > Jump to Previous Placeholder.\n\nIn Swift files, predictive code completion offers code suggestions at your insertion point. When you type, or press enter to go to a new line, Xcode predicts code for that location. For example, if you type “Image” into the source editor, Xcode predicts the rest of the code to finish the statement. When the code-completion window displays, use the Tab key to fill in the predictive code-completion suggestion, or Return to accept the regular code completion.\n\nFor common code structures, Xcode provides snippets you can add to your code. Click the Library button (+)  in the upper-right corner of the project window, select the “Show the Snippets library” option, then select a snippet and drag it to the desired location in the editor. Navigate between the placeholders to customize the snippet for your needs.\n\nTo add your own code snippet:\n\n### Annotate your code for visibility\n\nThe jump bar and the minimap each provide a quick visual way to navigate your code in the Xcode source editor. Annotate your code with `MARK`, `TODO`, and `FIXME` comments to enhance the power of these tools when organizing your code.\n\n\n\nAdd a `MARK` comment to add a heading to a section of code. Include a dash in the comment to instruct Xcode to show a divider line before the section in the jump bar and minimap.\n\nAdd a `TODO` comment to indicate where you want to do future work. The jump bar highlights the `TODO` comment with an icon for easy identification.\n\nAdd a `FIXME` comment to note where you need to make a fix in your code. The jump bar highlights the `FIXME` comment with a different icon.\n\nIn addition to the organizational benefits, consistent use of `MARK`, `TODO`, and `FIXME` comments improves your ability to search for common sections, future updates, and needed fixes.\n\n### Add Quick Help comments to your code\n\nView Quick Help comments for a symbol by selecting it and choosing View > Inspectors > Quick Help. Alternatively, Control-click a symbol and select Show Quick Help. Add Quick Help comments to your code to clarify usage for other developers.\n\nTo add Quick Help to a symbol in your code, hover over the symbol declaration, Command-click it and choose Add Documentation. Xcode adds lines of comments, preceded with `\/\/\/`, that have placeholders for a description, parameters, throws, and a return value, depending on the symbol declaration. Update the placeholders using Markup syntax to complete the comments and enable Quick Help for the symbol.\n\nXcode formats and displays the information as Quick Help when you view it.\n\n\n\nXcode also formats Quick Help from multiline comments that begin with `\/**` and end with `*\/`. For more information about the Markup syntax for Quick Help, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Xcode\/Reference\/xcode_markup_formatting_ref\/index.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40016497-CH2-SW1].",

Alternatively, choose Editor > Create Code Snippet.\n2. Specify a name and summary for your snippet.\n3. If you don’t select code when creating the snippet, enter code into the snippet editor. Mark any placeholders in your snippet with `<#placeholder name#>`.\n4.
