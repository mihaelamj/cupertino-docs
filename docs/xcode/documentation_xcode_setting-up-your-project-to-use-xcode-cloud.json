For a smooth configuration process, review the requirements for using Xcode Cloud and make changes as needed. Then, configure your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud and start practicing continuous integration and delivery (CI\/CD).\n\n### Set up your App Store Connect account\n\nTo use Xcode Cloud, you need to:\n\n- Be enrolled in the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/programs\/].\n- Use Xcode 15 or later.\n- Add your Apple Account under Accounts in Xcode Settings.\n- Have an app record for your app in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/] or have the required role or permission to create one.\n\nTo create an app record, you need to have the App Manager, Admin, or Account Holder role for your team. If you have the Developer role, you need the Create Apps permission. If you don’t have the required role or permission, work with a team member who does. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Xcode-Cloud-for-Your-Team#Create-an-app-record-in-App-Store-Connect].\n\n\n\nFor more information about roles in App Store Connect, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/reference\/role-permissions].\n\n### Configure your project and workspace\n\nIf you create a project from a template, the default settings automatically meet Xcode Cloud requirements. If you have an existing project, be sure it meets the following project and workspace requirements:\n\n- Use a consistent Xcode project or workspace.\n- Use shared schemes. For information on sharing a scheme, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project].\n- Enable the archive action for the scheme that builds your app or framework.\n- Ensure your dependencies and additional third-party tools are available to Xcode Cloud. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Making-Dependencies-Available-to-Xcode-Cloud].\n- Allow Xcode to manage signing for you. To use automatic code signing, toggle the “Automatically manage signing” checkbox in the Signing & Capabilities pane in the project editor.\n- Set the bundle identifier for your app target in the Signing & Capabilities pane of your Xcode project or workspace. If you use `.xcconfig` files to set the bundle identifier, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Your-First-Xcode-Cloud-Workflow#Review-Xcode-Cloud-workflows] for more information.\n\n\n\n### Use a remote source control repository\n\nYou need a remote repository using Git to use Xcode Cloud. To learn more about using source control with Git in Xcode, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/source-control-management].\n\nXcode Cloud supports the following source code management (SCM) providers:\n\n- [https:\/\/bitbucket.org] and [https:\/\/bitbucket.org\/product\/enterprise]\n- [https:\/\/github.com] and [https:\/\/github.com\/enterprise]\n- [https:\/\/gitlab.com] and [https:\/\/about.gitlab.com\/install]\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you need a certain permission or role to connect Xcode Cloud to your Git repository. The exact permission depends on the SCM provider you use:\n\n- If you host your code on Bitbucket Cloud or Bitbucket Server, you need the administrator permission.\n- If you host your code on GitHub or GitHub Enterprise, you need to be an organization owner, or need the admin permission if you don’t use a GitHub organization.\n- If you host your code on GitLab, or on a self-managed GitLab instance, you need the maintainer permission.\n\nIf you don’t have the required role or permission, work with a team member who does. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Xcode-Cloud-for-Your-Team#Connect-Xcode-Cloud-to-an-admin-managed-Git-repository].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **About continuous integration and delivery with Xcode Cloud**: Learn how continuous integration and delivery with Xcode Cloud helps you create high-quality apps and frameworks.\n- **Configuring your first Xcode Cloud workflow**: Set up your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud and adopt continuous integration and delivery.\n\n",
