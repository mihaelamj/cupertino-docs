For Xcode Cloud to automatically build and test your code when you make changes, provide a continuous secure HTTPS connection on port 443 to the Git repository that contains your code.\n\nWhen you configure your workspace or project to use Xcode Cloud, Xcode analyzes it to detect the Source Code Management (SCM) provider you use. On the “Grant Access to Your Source Code” sheet, click Grant Access and let Xcode guide you through your SCM provider’s native authorization flow.\n\nMake sure you have the required permission or role to grant Xcode Cloud access to your Git repository. Additionally, if you use a self-hosted SCM provider — for example, Bitbucket Server — make sure Xcode Cloud can access your Git repository.
