This signal indicates that the requested system call doesn’t exist.\n\nFor example, the code below uses system call number 12345, which isn’t valid and produces a `SIGSYS` signal.\n\n```c\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n    syscall(12345);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nFor a list of valid system calls, see the `syscall.h` header file.\n\n## Exceptions\n\n- **EXC_ARITHMETIC**: An arithmetic problem terminated the process, often because of division by zero or a floating-point error.\n- **EXC_BAD_ACCESS**: A bad access to memory terminated the process.\n- **EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)**: A bus error terminated the process, often because the process tried to access a misaligned or invalid address in memory, or due to a pointer authentication failure.\n- **EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)**: A memory segmentation fault terminated the process, often because the process tried to access an invalid or out-of-bounds address in memory.\n- **EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP) and EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION (SIGILL)**: A trace trap or invalid CPU instruction interrupted the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.\n- **EXC_CRASH**: The process crashed.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)**: The process terminated because it received an abort signal.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGKILL)**: The operating system terminated the process, often because a background task violated a requirement, device resources were limited, or the user force quit the app.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGQUIT)**: Another processes terminated the process, often because the process violated a requirement or timeout.\n- **EXC_CRASH (SIGTERM)**: A software termination signal terminated the process.\n- **EXC_GUARD**: The process violated a guarded resource protection, often related to file descriptors.\n- **EXC_RESOURCE**: The operating system stopped the process because the process exceeded a limit on resource consumption, like CPU time or memory.\n\n",
