  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf you use source control to work on code with collaborators or to manage multiple versions of your Xcode project for different releases, eventually, you need to sync code changes between versions. Git source control provides a mechanism for combining sets of code changes by merging those changes together, and Xcode provides a visual interface for performing a *merge*.\n\n\n\n### Merge code changes\n\nAfter you complete work in a feature or bug fix branch, you merge your changes into your main development or production branch. Alternatively, you merge other updates from your main development or production branch into your feature or bug fix branch to resolve conflicts or to sync your work with the latest updates and ensure everything functions appropriately before merging back into your main development or production branch.\n\nIf there are no conflicts, Xcode completes the merge.\n\n### Resolve conflicts with other code\n\nIn a source control repository, a *conflict* occurs when two commits have incompatible changes and Git can’t merge the changes automatically. For example, a conflict might occur when two developers change the same lines in the same source file.\n\nIf there are conflicts when you attempt to merge changes in Xcode, Xcode presents a comparison view for you to review and resolve the conflicts.\n\n\n\nTo resolve a conflict, click the question mark (?) for that conflict (that appears in the gutter between the left and right versions of the file) and select which option you want to use to resolve it:\n\nAfter you choose a resolution for each conflict, Xcode enables the Merge button. Click the Merge button to complete the merge, or click Cancel to abort the merge and restore your branch so you can make more changes before merging.",
