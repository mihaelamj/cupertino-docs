  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse Simulator to run apps in visionOS without installing them on a physical device. When you run your app in Simulator, you can see a monoscopic view of your app’s windows and 3D content inside an immersive space. Use your Mac to alter the viewpoint of the app within the space and navigate the app’s interface.\n\n\n\n### Interact with your app\n\nTo use your Mac’s pointer and keyboard to create gestures, choose “Select to interact with the scene” from the buttons at the bottom-right of a visionOS simulator window. You pointer movements control where your eyes look when you hover over content within the space.\n\nUse the following actions to trigger gestures:\n\nActivate device buttons using menu items or by clicking the controls in the simulator window toolbar.\n\n### Navigate the space\n\nUse your Mac’s pointer and the keyboard to reposition your viewpoint in a visionOS simulator window:\n\nYou can also control the viewpoint with a standard drag. To do so, choose “Drag to pan the camera” from the buttons at the bottom-right of the simulator window to move the viewpoint left, right, up or down and choose “Drag to dolly the camera” to move it forward or backward.\n\nTo change your viewing angle, Control-drag inside a visionOS simulator window. You can choose “Drag to tilt the camera” from the buttons at the bottom-right of the simulator window to use a drag without the Control key.\n\nTo reset the viewpoint and viewing angle for a visionOS simulator, choose the Reset Camera button at the bottom-right of its window.\n\nWhen moving with a trackpad or Magic Mouse, Simulator respects the natural scrolling setting on macOS.\n\nYou can also use a game controller to control your movement. Use the left stick to move left, right, forward or back. Use R2 and L2 to move up and down. Use the right stick on a game controller to pan around the space.\n\n### Switch between simulated scenes\n\nSimulator provides multiple built-in scenes you can use to simulate passthrough in different surroundings. These include unique room layouts and furniture for different testing scenarios, each available in different lighting conditions.\n\nUse the simulated scene to test:\n\nTo change the simulated scene, click the Simulated Scenes button in the toolbar at the top-right of a visionOS simulator window and choose a different scene.\n\n### Test SharePlay experiences in FaceTime\n\nLaunch and test your app’s SharePlay experiences in the simulator using FaceTime. To start a FaceTime session, choose Features > FaceTime, and then choose an option from the submenu. After choosing an option, the selected number of Spatial and Non-Spatial Participants appear in space. Use this session to launch and test your app’s SharePlay Group Activities, and other FaceTime experiences.",

These include unique room layouts and furniture for different testing scenarios, each available in different lighting conditions.\n\nUse the simulated scene to test:\n\n- Readability of your app in varying backgrounds and varying lighting conditions.\n- Different scenarios, including limited and cluttered surroundings, to see how your app adapts to them.\n- Content layout, positioning, and scale.\n- Spatial audio and acoustics.\n\nTo change the simulated scene, click the Simulated Scenes button in the toolbar at the top-right of a visionOS simulator window and choose a different scene.\n\n### Test SharePlay experiences in FaceTime\n\nLaunch and test your app’s SharePlay experiences in the simulator using FaceTime. To start a FaceTime session, choose Features > FaceTime, and then choose an option from the submenu. After choosing an option, the selected number of Spatial and Non-Spatial Participants appear in space. Use this session to launch and test your app’s SharePlay Group Activities, and other FaceTime experiences.\n\n\n\n## Simulator interactions\n\n- **Interacting with your app in the iOS and iPadOS simulator**: Use your Mac to control interactions with your iOS and iPadOS apps in Simulator.\n- **Interacting with your app in the tvOS simulator**: Use your Mac to control interactions with your tvOS apps in Simulator.\n- **Interacting with your app in the watchOS simulator**: Use your Mac to control interactions with your watchOS apps in Simulator.\n- **Configuring Simulator for your working environment**: Adjust Simulator settings for window or screen size, the light or dark appearance, and audio settings, and restart or reset a simulated device.\n- **Simulating an external display or CarPlay**: Test how your app handles an external display or CarPlay from Simulator.\n- **Capturing screenshots and videos from Simulator**: Record and share test results, or prepare for App Store distribution with screenshots and videos of your app from Simulator.\n\n",
