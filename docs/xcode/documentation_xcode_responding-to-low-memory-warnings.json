The amount of memory use that triggers a memory warning corresponds to the yellow region in Xcode’s memory gauge. Your app can receive a memory warning in any of these ways:\n\n- UIKit calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning(_:)] method of your app delegate.\n- UIKit calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/didReceiveMemoryWarning()] method of active [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController] objects.\n- iOS posts [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification] to the default notification center.\n- Dispatch queues receive an event with source type [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch\/DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_MEMORYPRESSURE].\n\nThe operating system sends low-memory warnings using a best-effort approach, and your app needs to respond to them as quickly as possible. If memory demand on the system increases faster than the warnings relieve memory pressure, the system may not have time to send the low-memory warnings and wait for apps to respond.
