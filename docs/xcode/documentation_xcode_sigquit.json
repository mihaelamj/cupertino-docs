It doesn’t necessarily mean that the process crashed, but the process likely misbehaved in a detectable manner. For a command-line process, this signal can also be sent by the user pressing control-\\ although the key binding may vary by shell and configuration.\n\nWith iOS and iPadOS keyboard extensions, the host app terminates the keyboard extension if it takes too long to load. Although the exception information is different in a watchdog termination, investigate `EXC_CRASH (SIGQUIT)` with the same techniques discussed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/addressing-watchdog-terminations].",
