To use some app services, you must provision your app, adding a capability with Xcode’s project editor that configures the app service correctly for you. Xcode edits the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List] files, adds related frameworks, and configures your signing assets.\n\nHowever, some app services — such as Game Center and In-App Purchase — require additional configuration in App Store Connect and your developer account.
