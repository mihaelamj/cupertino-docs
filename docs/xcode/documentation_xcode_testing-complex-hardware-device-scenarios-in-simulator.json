For example:\n\n- Face ID and Touch ID each require a setup process. To test how your app handles the case when Face ID or Touch ID isn’t set up on a device, you would have to remove fingerprints or faces from your device, and then set them up again after that test.\n- Fall detection requires significant setup and preparation to do repeated tests safely.\n- To trigger a memory warning in your app on a device, you need to open up a number of other apps that consume memory, and coordinate it in such a way that your app receives the memory warning.\n- iCloud syncing on a device may not happen as frequently as you need during your testing.\n- Testing how your app responds to different locations or how it responds as you traverse a route can be time-consuming and difficult, especially in areas with poor cellular service.\n\nTest these and other scenarios with Simulator’s hardware device feature support.\n\n### Test Face ID or Touch ID authentication\n\nSince Face ID and Touch ID each require a setup process, you need to test both how your app handles authentication when the user hasn’t configured Face ID or Touch ID yet, and when the user has configured them. To test the preconfigured state, choose Features > Face ID or Features > Touch ID, and deselect the Enrolled option. Select the Enrolled option to test the configured state.\n\nWhen your app requests authentication, try a matching ID with Features > Face ID > Matching Face or Features > Touch ID > Matching Touch, or a non-matching ID with Features > Face ID > Non-matching Face or Features > Touch ID > Non-matching Touch.\n\n### Test a simulated fall\n\nTo test how your app responds to a detected fall in Simulator, choose Features > Simulate Fall, then choose one of the following fall response options to simulate:\n\n- Confirmed\n- Dismissed\n- Rejected\n- Unresponsive\n\n### Test a memory warning\n\nNavigate to a place in your app where you’ve added code that responds to a memory warning, then choose Debug > Simulate Memory Warning. Confirm that your app responds appropriately.\n\n### Test iCloud sync\n\nUse Simulator to test data synchronization between iCloud and the simulated device.

Choose Features > Location, and then select one of these options:\n\n\n\nTo set the location to a specific latitude and longitude:\n\n1. Choose Features > Location > Custom Location…\n2. Enter your location’s latitude and longitude in the dialog box.\n3. Click OK to set the location.\n\nTo clear the location so that the simulated device has no location, choose Features > Location > None.\n\n### View the system log\n\nUse the system log to find errors, warnings, and other issues with your application. Choose Debug > Open System Log to open the system log for the simulated device in the Console app.\n\n## Simulator testing considerations\n\n- **Testing in Simulator versus testing on hardware devices**: Review the differences between Simulator and hardware devices to determine which you should choose to test a scenario.\n- **Sharing data with Simulator**: Enter text directly in Simulator, or share location data, images, web addresses, files, or data from the clipboard with Simulator.\n- **Identifying graphics and animations issues in Simulator**: Reveal performance and display issues in your views with color overlays, and slow down animations to debug and improve them.\n\n",
