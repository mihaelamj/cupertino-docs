  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAt different points in the software development workflow you’ll want to run subsets of your tests:\n\n## Run tests from a test plan\n\nTo run all the tests in the active test plan, you have two options: you can run them in Xcode (choose Product > Test), or you can run the `xcodebuild` command in Terminal:\n\nConfigure which tests the test runner runs when you perform this action by editing the test plan for your Xcode target’s scheme. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project]. If your build scheme includes more than one test plan, choose Product > Test Plan to select a test plan to run. View the active plan under the Test navigator, choose View > Navigators > Tests. When you select a different test plan or a different build scheme, the Test navigator updates to display that plan. Expand the outline view for the plan to see the targets, suites, test functions, and parameterized test cases it includes. Items you disable or mark to be skipped appear dimmed.\n\n## Interpret test results\n\nAfter your test run, Xcode displays a status icon in the Test navigator next to the test plan and next to each item in its outline view.\n\n\n\nThe possible states are:\n\nClick to select an item in the Test navigator to display the implementation of a test in the source editor and access additional details for specific test failures or skipped tests. The same status icon appears in the gutter alongside the test implementation to help you locate the failure in the source editor. Click the diamond icon next to the debug message to expand it and review what the debug message reveals about the conditions that led to the failure.\n\n\n\nTests functions you write with Swift Testing capture the state of variables you use in expressions that you pass to expectation macros and input parameters the test runner passes to a test function. Inspect those values to further understand the cause of the failure, click the Show button at the bottom of the debug message and expand the Results and Arguments regions to view the state of expectation expressions and input parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Access additional information in the test report\n\nEach test run produces a test report. Locate these reports in Xcode in the Report navigator by choosing View > Navigators > Reports, then select the Test action under your build scheme name.\n\nThe top level of a test report provides you with a high level summary of the test you’ve run. It highlights important patterns failure information, screenshots, and more to help you determine where to start your investigations.\n\nFurther information can be found under the additional sections of the report:\n\nWhen you run tests with `xcodebuild` in Terminal, the command outputs an Xcode Test Results (`.xcresults`) bundle that contains session results, code coverage (if enabled), and other logs. You can open this file in Xcode to view or share it with other members of your development team.\n\n## Run a single test function\n\nNavigate to the Swift file that contains the test function you want to run in Xcode. Move the pointer over the diamond icon alongside the function declaration in the editor gutter, and click the gray play icon:\n\n\n\nAlternatively, locate the test function in the Xcode Test navigator by moving the pointer over the test function name and click the play icon.\n\n\n\nXcode runs the selected test function and updates the icon to indicate the outcome.\n\nTo run a single test function in Terminal, run `xcodebuild` by giving the test function’s identifier as the parameter to the `-only-testing` option. The identifier for a test function has the form `test_target\/test_type\/test_function`.\n\n## Run a parameterized test function with a specific input\n\nClicking the play icon next to the parameterized test function runs all test cases for that test. To select a specific test case to run, click the expansion arrow before the test function name in the Test navigator, move the pointer over the diamond icon alongside the specific test case, then click the gray play icon.\n\n\n\nWhen you pass one or more collections to a `@Test` macro that supports parameterization, the macro generates a test case for each element or element pair. Each test case represents a unique set of input parameters that the test runner passes to the test function. If the test fails for one or more inputs, the corresponding diagnostics indicate which inputs to examine. Selecting the specific test case runs the test function with just the input for that case which is useful when debugging. For more information on implementing parameterized tests, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing\/ParameterizedTesting].\n\n## Run a group of the test functions\n\nTo run test functions defined under a common type or suite, move the pointer over the diamond icon alongside the type’s declaration in the editor gutter, and click the gray play icon. In Swift Testing, a *test suite* is any type that includes the definition for one or more test functions.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, to run a group of test functions from the Xcode Test navigator, move the pointer over a plan, target, or suite listed in the navigator, then click the gray play icon:\n\n\n\nYou can nest test suites and optionally annotate them with the `@Suite` macro to provide additional information about the test functions they contain. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing\/OrganizingTests].\n\nIn XCTest, you implement all of your test functions on a subclass of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTestCase]. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/defining-test-cases-and-test-methods].\n\nXcode runs the test functions the selected item contains and updates the icon to indicate the outcome.\n\nTo run the test functions in a test case in Terminal, run `xcodebuild` by giving the suite’s identifier as the parameter to the `-only-testing` option. The identifier for a suite has the form `test_target\/test_suite`.\n\n## View and run tests by tag\n\nIn Swift Testing, you can use the  [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing\/Trait\/tags(_:)] trait to annotate a group of related tests. These additional groups can be identified in the outline view under the Tags section of the Test navigator. Click the tag icon at the top of the Test navigator to view test functions organized by their tags. For more information about declaring tags and adding tags to tests, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Testing\/AddingTags].\n\nTo run all of the test functions associated with a tag or a single test function under the tag group, move the pointer over the tag or test function, then click the gray play icon.\n\n## Run testing repeatedly to determine reliability\n\nControl-click the diamond icon next to a test function or test suite type and select “Run ** Repeatedly”. In the panel that appears, choose when to stop running the test. Options include:\n\nChoose the maximum number of times to repeat the test, whether to pause execution if the test fails, and whether to restart the test runner for each repetition. Finally, click Run to repeatedly run the test.\n\n\n\nTo repeatedly run tests in Terminal, specify the number of repetitions with the `-test-repetitions` option, optionally specifying whether the tests should repeat until success or failure, and whether to restart the test runner for each repetition:",
