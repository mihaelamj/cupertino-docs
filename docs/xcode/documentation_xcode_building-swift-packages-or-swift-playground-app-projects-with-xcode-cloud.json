However, Xcode Cloud can’t build standalone Swift packages. To build your Swift package with Xcode Cloud:\n\n1. Create an app project or workspace in Xcode.\n2. Add your Swift package as a local package as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/organizing-your-code-with-local-packages].\n3. Commit your `Package.resolved` file.\n4. Create your first workflow as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Your-First-Xcode-Cloud-Workflow].\n\nWhen Xcode Cloud starts a build, it builds your Swift package as part of the app project.\n\nSimilarly, Xcode Cloud can’t build standalone apps you create with [https:\/\/www.apple.com\/swift\/playgrounds\/]. To build an app you created with Swift Playgrounds, save the Swift Playground app project to your Mac, add it to an Xcode project as described above, then configure your first workflow for the Xcode project.\n\n\n\n## Setup and maintenance\n\n- **Making dependencies available to Xcode Cloud**: Review dependencies and make them available to Xcode Cloud before you configure your project to use Xcode Cloud.\n- **Configuring Xcode Cloud for your team**: Start using continuous integration and delivery with Xcode Cloud as a team.\n- **Sharing macOS and Xcode versions across Xcode Cloud workflows**: Use custom aliases to share configurations with multiple workflows.\n- **Sharing environment variables across Xcode Cloud workflows**: Apply common configurations to multiple workflows by using shared environment variables.\n- **Setting the next build number for Xcode Cloud builds**: Start numbering builds from a custom build number for your existing Mac app to avoid version collisions.\n- **Including notes for testers with a beta release of your app**: Add text files to your Xcode project to provide notes to beta testers about what to test.\n- **Removing your project from Xcode Cloud**: Remove your project from Xcode Cloud to delete app and workflow data, disconnect your Git repository, and remove the Slack integration.\n\n",
