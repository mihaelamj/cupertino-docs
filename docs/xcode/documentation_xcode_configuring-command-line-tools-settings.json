For example, you might want to release your app with the latest version of Xcode, while using a beta version to try out new APIs.\n\nYou can do this by selecting a default Xcode version to use for command-line tools in Xcode settings, or you can set it from the command line. To apply the change to every user account on your Mac, use either Xcode settings or the command line. To apply the change to the current shell session only, use the command line.\n\n### Check the default Xcode app for command-line tools\n\nTo identify the default Xcode app for command-line tools, choose Xcode > Settings, and click Locations in the sidebar. The Command Line Tools section of the Locations pane displays both the Xcode version number and the location of the file. \n\nAlternatively, you can identify the Xcode version from the command line. Enter `xcode-select` with the `--print-path` option in Terminal. This command returns the path of the active developer directory for Xcode.
