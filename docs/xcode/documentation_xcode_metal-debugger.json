  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe Metal debugger consists of a suite of tools for debugging and profiling your Metal app.\n\nUnlike pausing at breakpoints during runtime, you can capture your Metal workload for multiple frames and then jump back and forth in time to explore the captured work. The Metal debugger enables you to explore the dependencies between passes, and offers insights for improving the performance of your app. You can also debug your shaders in draw commands and compute dispatches to fix sources of artifacts (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Investigating-visual-artifacts]).\n\nIn addition, the Metal debugger displays your Metal workload on a profiling timeline and offers detailed statistics like performance counters and per-line shader profiling data. These tools can help you identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks in your app (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Optimizing-GPU-performance]).\n\n\n\nFor additional information about the Metal debugger, see the following video sessions:",
