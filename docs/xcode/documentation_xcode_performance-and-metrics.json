Learn how to improve responsiveness, reduce memory usage, and analyze complex behavior over time.\n- **Analyzing the performance of your shipping app**: View power and performance metrics for apps you distribute through the App Store.\n- **Creating a performance plan for your visionOS app**: Identify your app’s performance and power goals and create a plan to measure and assess them.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\n- **Analyzing responsiveness issues in your shipping app**: Identify responsiveness issues your users encounter, and use the hang and hitch data in Xcode Organizer to determine which issues are most important to fix.\n- **Improving app responsiveness**: Create a user experience that feels responsive by removing hangs and hitches from your app.\n- **Understanding user interface responsiveness**: Make your app more responsive by examining the event-handling and rendering loop.\n- **Understanding and improving SwiftUI performance**: Identify and address long-running view updates, and reduce the frequency of updates.\n- **Understanding hangs in your app**: Determine the cause for delays in user interactions by examining the main thread and the main run loop.\n- **Understanding hitches in your app**: Determine the cause of interruptions in motion by examining the render loop.\n- **Diagnosing performance issues early**: Diagnose potential performance issues in your app during development and testing with the Thread Performance Checker tool in Xcode.\n- **Reducing your app’s launch time**: Create a more responsive experience with your app by minimizing time spent in startup.\n- **Reducing terminations in your app**: Minimize how frequently the system stops your app by addressing common termination reasons.\n\n## Processor usage\n\n- **Addressing CPU bottlenecks**: Locate and fix pipeline stalls, cache misses, and other performance issues.\n- **Analyzing CPU usage with the Processor Trace instrument**: Identify code where your app uses the CPU inefficiently.\n\n## Memory and size\n\n- **Reducing your app’s memory use**: Improve your app’s performance by analyzing memory-use metrics and making changes to maximize memory efficiency.\n- **Reducing your app’s size**: Measure your app’s size, optimize its assets and settings, and adopt technologies that help streamline installation over a mobile internet connection.\n\n## Graphics\n\n- **Analyzing the performance of your Metal app**: Ensure consistent, smooth rendering by profiling your app’s frame time.\n- **Analyzing the memory usage of your Metal app**: Keep your app alive in the background by managing its memory footprint.\n\n## Power\n\n- **Analyzing your app’s battery use**: Increase the available use time for your app on a single battery charge by reducing your appʼs power consumption.\n- **Measuring your app’s power use with Power Profiler**: Profile your app’s power impact whether or not your device is connected to Xcode.\n- **Reducing your app’s battery use**: Adopt design principles and recommended APIs to consume less power.\n\n## Disk usage\n\n- **Reducing disk writes**: Improve your app’s responsiveness by optimizing how it writes data to permanent storage.\n- **Reducing your app’s disk usage**: Measure and minimize the space your app uses to store its files.\n\n## Network\n\n- **Analyzing HTTP traffic with Instruments**: Measure HTTP-based network performance and usage of your apps.\n\n## Custom instruments\n\n- **Creating custom modelers for intelligent instruments**: Create Custom Modelers with the CLIPS language and learn how the embedded rules engine works.\n\n## Tuning and debugging\n\n- **Devices and Simulator**: Configure and manage devices connected to your Mac or devices in Simulator and use them to run your app.\n- **Debugging**: Identify and address issues in your app using the Xcode debugger, Xcode Organizer, Metal debugger, and Instruments.\n- **Testing**: Develop and run tests to detect logic failures, UI problems, and performance regressions.\n\n",
