  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nXcode provides a *transaction manager* that you use with StoreKit Testing in Xcode.  With transaction manager, you can test in-app purchases at any stage of development. Testing in-app purchases before pushing your app live helps you ensure a seamless purchase flow, test various edge cases and logic, and validate that purchases behave correctly.\n\nUse the transaction manager to change settings and initiate test conditions, inspect transactions, and simulate different kinds of purchases.\n\n### Change settings and initiate test conditions\n\nSelect your StoreKit configuration file in the Project navigator and choose Editor to change the following settings:\n\n\n\n### Inspect transactions with the transaction manager\n\nUse the options in the transaction manager to perform steps in an in-app purchase flow that normally occur outside your app, such as approving or declining Ask To Buy transactions, receiving refunds, and more. To open the transaction manager, choose Debug > StoreKit > Manage Transactions.\n\n\n\nThe transaction manager lists all the transactions for the running app. If you have multiple apps running on multiple devices, select the app in the sidebar to view its transactions. Use the transaction manager to perform these actions:\n\nThe test environment automatically syncs the transaction changes you make. You don’t need to rebuild and run your app.\n\n### Simulate a purchase\n\nThe StoreKit configuration file lets you define in-app purchases in two sections.  Use the Products section to define consumable and non-consumable in-app purchases.  Use the Subscriptions section to define auto-renewable subscriptions and non-renewing subscriptions.\n\nTo make a one-time in-app purchase, select the app from the left-hand side that you want to test,  then click the plus button on the left of the filter bar. From the product screen that displays, select the product you want to buy, then click Next.\n\n\n\nOn the configuration pop-up that displays, you can either accept the defaults, or change the properties to reflect the purchase you want. After you configure your in-app purchase, click the Done button.\n\n\n\nIf your device or simulator aren’t running, the transaction appears as a new item at the top of the transaction manager screen in the unfinished state. Unfinished transactions appear with a warning symbol next to them. To complete the transaction, run your app on a device or simulator. You can then test that your app successfully completes the transaction.\n\nTo create a test subscription purchase, return to the transaction manager main screen, click the plus button again, but this time choose an auto-renewable subscription from the products list, and then click Next.\n\n\n\nWhen the subscription configuration pop-up appears, either accept the defaults, or change the properties to reflect the kind of subscription you want. For example, if your subscription has multiple offer types, you can optionally select an offer code from the offer drop-down menu. To test different renewal options, select Automatically Renew to test how renewals behave by default in production, or select Don’t Renew, which creates one purchase, and then cancels the subscription. Click Done to trigger the subscription purchase.\n\n\n\nTo complete the test purchase, launch the app on the device or simulator where your purchases occur, and see the purchase complete in the transaction manager and appear in the app.\n\n### Send a purchase intent\n\nMaking in-app purchases isn’t the only way people can buy content for you app or game. As a developer, you can promote in-app purchases from the App Store. When a custom sees an in-app purchase in the App Store, they can initiate a purchase. The App Store then sends that purchase intent to the customer on their device. When the customer opens their device, they complete the purchase.\n\nThis action of sending the purchase from the App Store to your app is called a purchase intent. And you can test this interaction in the transaction manager as follows:\n\n\n\nOnce the customer confirms the purchase on their device, the purchase completes. After that, the transaction appears.",

To open the transaction manager, choose Debug > StoreKit > Manage Transactions.\n\n\n\nThe transaction manager lists all the transactions for the running app. If you have multiple apps running on multiple devices, select the app in the sidebar to view its transactions. Use the transaction manager to perform these actions:\n\n- **Filter transactions** — Type a search term in the filter box at the bottom of the dialog to narrow the number of transactions that display.\n- **Inspect a transaction** — Click a transaction, then view that transaction’s details in the inspector. Click the jump button next to a product or group to navigate to it in the StoreKit configuration file in Xcode.\n- **Create a transaction** — Click the plus button on the left of the filter bar. Select the product you want to create a transaction for, and then configure the transaction. Use this feature to test in-app purchases made outside of the device, and to simulate in-app purchases that customers complete on different devices. For more information about creating transactions, see [#Simulate-a-purchase].\n- **Delete a transaction** — Select a transaction and click Delete to retest a scenario that the customer can perform only once. For example, customers can purchase a non-consumable product only once, so delete that transaction to retest the purchase. Delete subscription transactions to retest introductory offers. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/implementing-introductory-offers-in-your-app]. If your app uses the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/storekit\/in-app_purchase\/original_api_for_in-app_purchase], refresh the receipt to get an updated receipt without the deleted transaction.\n- **Send a purchase intent** — Simulate sending purchase intents to your app to ensure your app processes them correctly. For more information about receiving and handling purchase intents in your app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/PurchaseIntent].  For more information about sending a purchase intent in the testing environment, see [#Send-a-purchase-intent].\n- **Approve or decline a transaction** — Click Approve or Decline to resolve a pending transaction that’s testing an Ask to Buy scenario.\n- **Refund a transaction** — Click Refund to simulate a customer receiving a refund.\n- **Resolve a transaction** — Click Resolve to simulate a customer resolving an interrupted purchase. To simulate the interruption, choose Editor > Enable Interrupted Purchases.\n- **Test a price increase** — Select a subscription transaction, then click the Request Price Increase Consent button in the toolbar. Test using the price increase sheet that the system presents in your app, or use the buttons to simulate the customer’s response from outside the app, such as from a push notification. Click the Approve button to indicate that the customer accepts the price increase. Click the Decline button to simulate the customer canceling the subscription.\n\nThe test environment automatically syncs the transaction changes you make. You don’t need to rebuild and run your app.\n\n### Simulate a purchase\n\nThe StoreKit configuration file lets you define in-app purchases in two sections.  Use the Products section to define consumable and non-consumable in-app purchases.

After you configure your in-app purchase, click the Done button.\n\n\n\nIf your device or simulator aren’t running, the transaction appears as a new item at the top of the transaction manager screen in the unfinished state. Unfinished transactions appear with a warning symbol next to them. To complete the transaction, run your app on a device or simulator. You can then test that your app successfully completes the transaction.\n\nTo create a test subscription purchase, return to the transaction manager main screen, click the plus button again, but this time choose an auto-renewable subscription from the products list, and then click Next.\n\n\n\nWhen the subscription configuration pop-up appears, either accept the defaults, or change the properties to reflect the kind of subscription you want.

And you can test this interaction in the transaction manager as follows:\n\n1. Click the plus sign to create a new purchase.\n2. Choose the product to send a purchase intent for.\n3. Change the purchase type below the product list to Purchase Intent.\n4. Click Done and check your device to continue.\n\n\n\nOnce the customer confirms the purchase on their device, the purchase completes. After that, the transaction appears.\n\n## StoreKit\n\n- **Setting up StoreKit Testing in Xcode**: Prepare your test environment to test in-app purchases with data you configure locally.\n\n",
