  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nXcode comes with built-in support for source control accounts and makes it easy to leverage available Swift packages. Use Xcode to manage the versions of package dependencies and make sure your project has the most up-to-date code changes.\n\n### Add a package dependency\n\nTo add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select File > Add Package Dependency and enter its source control repository URL. You can also navigate to your target’s General pane, and in the “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” section, click the + button, select Add Other, and choose Add Package Dependency.\n\n\n\nInstead of adding a source control repository URL, you can search for a package on [https:\/\/github.com] or [https:\/\/github.com\/enterprise]. Add your GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account in Xcode’s settings, and a list of package repositories appears as you type. The following screenshot shows a list of repositories for the search term `ExamplePackage` for a user who added their Git provider in Xcode’s settings.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve added a source control account in Xcode’s settings and you haven’t yet entered a search term, the list contains package repositories from:\n\n### Decide on package requirements\n\nWhen you enter the package dependency’s URL or pick a Swift package from the list of packages, choose one of three *package requirements*. Package requirements determine the allowed versions of the package dependency in your project, and Xcode updates your package dependency based on the requirement that you choose.\n\nAfter you choose a package requirement, Xcode resolves and fetches the package dependency. Select the package’s products that you need, and add them to targets in your project.\n\nIn Xcode’s Project navigator, the Swift Package Dependencies section shows the newly added package dependency. Click the disclosure triangle to view the contents of the package as it exists locally on your Mac.\n\n### Use features and assets provided by a Swift package\n\nTo use a Swift package’s functionality in your app, import a package’s product as a Swift module. The following code snippet shows a view controller that imports a Swift package’s `MyLibrary` module and uses the package’s functionality:\n\n### Edit a package dependency\n\nYou can’t edit the content of your package dependencies directly. If you want to make changes to a package dependency, you need to add it as a *local package* to your project. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/editing-a-package-dependency-as-a-local-package] to learn how you can override a package dependency with a local package and make edits.\n\n### Coordinate package versions across your team\n\nWhen collaborating on a project, make sure everyone uses the same version of a package dependency. When you add a package dependency to a project, Xcode creates the `Package.resolved` file. It lists the specific Git commits to which each package dependency resolves and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PackageDescription\/Target\/checksum] of each binary dependency. Commit this file in Git to ensure that everyone is using the same version of a package dependency.\n\n### Delete a package dependency\n\nTo remove a package dependency from your Xcode project:\n\n",
