  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhile Simulator is useful for many types of tests, there are significant differences between Simulator and actual hardware devices that you need to consider when you choose which platform to use. These differences fall into several categories:\n\nEvaluate the differences to help you determine what features and functionality you can test in Simulator in addition to the testing you perform on hardware devices.\n\n### Evaluate general differences\n\nUse hardware devices to do performance testing for processing, graphics, and networking to ensure accurate results.\n\nSimulator is an app running on a Mac using the computer’s resources including the CPU, memory, and network connection. As a result, Simulator is not an accurate test of an app’s performance, memory usage, and networking speed. Use performance testing results in Simulator to determine relative differences in app functionality. If you encounter performance issues in Simulator but not on a hardware device, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/troubleshooting-simulator-launch-or-animation-issues].\n\nPerform user testing on hardware devices when you require real-world results, such as confirming that tap areas are large enough for users to tap, or text in your user interface is legible.\n\nUser interaction with a pointer and keyboard is different from using fingers on iOS and watchOS, hand gestures on visionOS, or the focus-based model used on tvOS. After you are satisfied that your app functions correctly in Simulator, test on devices to catch any unexpected issues with user interaction.\n\n### Evaluate display differences\n\nThe resolution, or pixels per point, on the hardware device and on the Mac can differ. This results in text and images that appear jagged, especially with smaller text.\n\nIncreasing the scale of the Simulator window can make text and images appear clearer.\n\nThe color gamut of the Mac screen can differ resulting in inaccurate colors in Simulator.\n\n### Evaluate system differences\n\nSimulator suspends background apps and processes on iOS 11 and later, tvOS 11 and later, and watchOS 4 and later. The debugger can resume a suspended process.\n\nSimulator treats the file system as case-sensitive on HFS+ and APFS formatted volumes.\n\n### Evaluate hardware differences\n\nThere is a reliable connection between simulated watchOS and iOS devices because they are both running in the Simulator.\n\nSimulator doesn’t support the following hardware:\n\n### Evaluate API differences\n\nSimulator doesn’t support the following frameworks:\n\nThe following features of APIs are not available in Simulator:\n\n### Evaluate Metal differences\n\nSimulator includes a Metal implementation that you can use to start developing your app. For more information on how it differs from a hardware processor, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Metal\/developing-metal-apps-that-run-in-simulator].",

These differences fall into several categories:\n\n- General: there are differences in processing, graphics, and network speed.\n- Display: there are differences in resolution and color.\n- System: there are differences in how the system handles backgrounding your app.\n- Hardware: Simulator doesn’t support some hardware features.\n- API: Simulator doesn’t support some APIs.\n- Metal: there are differences between the device GPU and your computer GPU.\n\nEvaluate the differences to help you determine what features and functionality you can test in Simulator in addition to the testing you perform on hardware devices.\n\n### Evaluate general differences\n\nUse hardware devices to do performance testing for processing, graphics, and networking to ensure accurate results.\n\nSimulator is an app running on a Mac using the computer’s resources including the CPU, memory, and network connection.

Drag and drop a JSON file with a push notification payload on the simulator to test receiving a push notification.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/UIBackgroundModes] key.\n- The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIVideoEditorController] class in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit].\n- Support for [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/handoff\/].\n\n### Evaluate Metal differences\n\nSimulator includes a Metal implementation that you can use to start developing your app. For more information on how it differs from a hardware processor, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Metal\/developing-metal-apps-that-run-in-simulator].\n\n## Simulator testing considerations\n\n- **Sharing data with Simulator**: Enter text directly in Simulator, or share location data, images, web addresses, files, or data from the clipboard with Simulator.\n- **Testing complex hardware device scenarios in Simulator**: Test hardware device-specific scenarios, such as Face ID or Touch ID authentication, fall detection, getting a memory warning, or location changes.\n- **Identifying graphics and animations issues in Simulator**: Reveal performance and display issues in your views with color overlays, and slow down animations to debug and improve them.\n\n",
