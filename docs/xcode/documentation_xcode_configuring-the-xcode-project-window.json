Then use features, like the jump bar, minimap, and tab bar, to navigate quickly around your project files.\n\nThe main window opens when you create or open a project. To open additional main windows, choose File > New > Window.\n\n\n\nThe areas of the main window:\n\n- The *toolbar* — for building and running your app, viewing the progress of tasks, and configuring the main window — appears at the top of the window.\n- The *editor area* — for viewing and editing the contents of your project, including code, user interface files, property lists, project settings, and more — appears in the middle of the window.\n- The *navigator area* — for viewing the parts of your project, including files, symbols, breakpoints, and build information — appears on the right of the editor area.\n- The *debug area* — for controlling the app runtime during debugging, and for displaying variables, register, and status information — appears below an editor pane.\n- The *inspector area* — for viewing and editing information about the project, or about the selected object in the navigator or editor area — appears on the right of the editor area.\n\nTo create an Xcode project, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/creating-an-xcode-project-for-an-app].\n\n\n\n### Show and hide areas of the main window\n\nConfigure the areas of the main window to focus on your specific task.
