For more information about Bitbucket code insights and configuring requirements for PRs, see [https:\/\/support.atlassian.com\/bitbucket-cloud\/docs\/code-insights\/].\n- [https:\/\/github.com] and [https:\/\/github.com\/enterprise] refer to their branch protection features as *status checks*. For more information about GitHub status checks and configuring requirements for PRs, see [https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/pull-requests\/collaborating-with-pull-requests\/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features\/about-status-checks].\n- [https:\/\/gitlab.com] and [https:\/\/about.gitlab.com\/install] don’t come with branch protection features that prevent merging PRs with errors. Instead, they only display build status information. This is a limitation of GitLab and self-managed GitLab instances and not limited to Xcode Cloud.\n\n\n\n## Configure requirements\n\nTo require a successful Xcode Cloud build or action before it’s possible to merge a PR:\n\n1. Configure a workflow that starts a new build for changes to a PR. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Start-Conditions#Start-builds-for-changes-to-a-pull-request].\n2. Navigate to the configuration section of your SCM provider’s website, and follow the instructions to add requirements for PRs.\n\nFor example, configure an Xcode Cloud workflow that starts a build for each change to a PR and performs a test and an archive action. On your SCM provider’s website, require a successful Xcode Cloud build to ensure that the target branch only receives verified changes. Alternatively, require a successful archive action and allow merging a PR even if the test action fails. A common use case for this configuration is during feature development when you consider it OK to merge PRs that target a feature branch even if they cause unit tests to fail.\n\n## Source code management\n\n- **Source code management setup**: Allow Xcode Cloud to access your Git repository.\n\n",
