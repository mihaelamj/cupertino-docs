For example, Xcode might add a required entitlement to a new entitlements file and configure the project to use those entitlements. When Xcode needs you to provide additional information, it presents a simplified UI for you to specify that information.\n\n\n\nXcode automatically manages your target’s entitlements file based on the capabilities you add to that target.

When you add a capability to an app or other target in your project, Xcode automatically configures that target to use the corresponding service.

If you need to edit the file manually, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/editing-property-list-files].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Adding capabilities to your app**: Configure your target to include and customize capabilities that provide access to Apple’s app services.\n\n## App execution\n\n- **Configuring background execution modes**: Indicate the background services your app requires to continue executing in the background in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.\n- **Configuring custom fonts**: Register your app as a provider or consumer of systemwide custom fonts.\n- **Configuring game controllers**: Enhance gameplay input by enabling the discovery, configuration, and use of physical game controllers.\n- **Configuring Maps support**: Register your iOS routing app to provide point-to-point directions to Maps and other apps.\n- **Configuring Siri support**: Enable your app and its Intents extension to resolve, confirm, and handle user-driven Siri requests for your app’s services.\n\n## Commerce\n\n- **Configuring Apple Pay support**: Process payments in your app using the payment information the user stores on their device.\n- **Configuring Sign in with Apple support**: Allow users to create an account and sign in to your app with their Apple Account.\n- **Configuring Wallet support**: Access the user’s Wallet to add, update, and display your app’s passes.\n\n## Data management\n\n- **Configuring an associated domain**: Create a two-way association between your app and your website to enable universal links, Handoff, App Clips, and shared web credentials.\n- **Configuring app groups**: Enable communication and data sharing between multiple installed apps created by the same developer.\n- **Configuring iCloud services**: Share user or app data among multiple instances of your app running on different devices.\n\n## Network\n\n- **Configuring network extensions**: Customize the various capabilities of your app’s networking stack, such as proxying DNS queries or creating packet tunnels.\n- **Registering your app with APNs**: Communicate with Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and receive a unique device token that identifies your app.\n- **Configuring Group Activities**: Leverage FaceTime infrastructure to create coordinated experiences users can share.\n- **Configuring media device discovery**: Add a third-party media device or protocol as a streaming option in the same system menu as AirPlay.\n\n## Security\n\n- **Configuring Family Controls**: Add the Family Controls entitlement to enable parental control features in your app and its Screen Time API app extensions.\n- **Configuring the hardened runtime**: Protect the runtime integrity of your macOS app by restricting access to sensitive resources and preventing common exploits.\n- **Configuring the macOS App Sandbox**: Protect system resources and user data from compromised apps by restricting access to the file system, network connections, and more.\n- **Configuring keychain sharing**: Share keychain items between multiple apps belonging to the same developer.\n- **Protecting local app data using containers on macOS**: Secure your app’s local storage data from unauthorized access and modification.\n- **Accessing app group containers in your existing macOS app**: Ensure your app has app group container entitlements and macOS can authorize them.\n\n## User data\n\n- **Configuring HealthKit access**: Read and write health and activity data in the Health app.\n- **Configuring HomeKit access**: Discover compatible accessories and communicate with configured accessories and services to perform actions.\n\n## Xcode IDE\n\n- **Projects and workspaces**: Manage the code and resources you use to build apps, libraries, and other software for Apple platforms.\n- **Source control management**: Back up your files, collaborate with others, and tag your releases with Git source control support in Xcode.\n- **Build system**: Compile your code into a binary format, and customize your project settings to build your code.\n- **Command-line tools**: Develop and customize your projects in Terminal.\n\n",
