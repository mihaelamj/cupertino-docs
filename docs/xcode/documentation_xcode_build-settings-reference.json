  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nLook up build settings for your Xcode project.\n\n### Active Build Action\n\n**Setting name:** `ACTION`\n\nA string identifying the build system action being performed.\n\n### Additional SDKs\n\n**Setting name:** `ADDITIONAL_SDKS`\n\nThe locations of any sparse SDKs that should be layered on top of the one specified by `SDKROOT`. If more than one SDK is listed, the first one has highest precedence. Every SDK specified in this setting should be a “sparse” SDK, for example, not an SDK for an entire macOS release.\n\n### Allow Multi-Platform Builds\n\n**Setting name:** `ALLOW_TARGET_PLATFORM_SPECIALIZATION`\n\nIf enabled, allows targets to build multiple times within a single build operation. Targets will build for the platform of the active run destination, as well as the platforms of any targets which depend on them.\n\n### Alternate Install Group\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATE_GROUP`\n\nThe group name or gid for the files listed under the `ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES` setting.\n\n### Alternate Install Permissions\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATE_MODE`\n\nPermissions used for the files listed under the `ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES` setting.\n\n### Alternate Install Owner\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATE_OWNER`\n\nThe owner name or uid for the files listed under the `ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES` setting.\n\n### Alternate Permissions Files\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES`\n\nList of files to which the alternate owner, group and permissions are applied.\n\n### Alternative Distribution - Web\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATIVE_DISTRIBUTION_WEB`\n\nEnable overriding your app’s distributor identifier for web distribution when running from Xcode.\n\n### Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES`\n\nAlways embed the Swift standard libraries in the target’s products, even if the target does not contain any Swift code.  For example, this should be enabled if the target is embedding other products which contain Swift, or if it is a test target which does not contain Swift but which is testing a product which does.  This setting only applies to wrapped products, not to standalone binary products.\n\n### Always Search User Paths (Deprecated)\n\n**Setting name:** `ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS`\n\nThis setting is deprecated as of Xcode 8.3 and may not be supported in future versions. It is recommended that you disable the setting.\n\nIf enabled, both `#include <header.h>`-style and `#include \"header.h\"`-style directives search the paths in `USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` before `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`. As a consequence, user headers, such as your own `String.h` header, have precedence over system headers when using `#include <header.h>`. This is done using the `-iquote` flag for the paths provided in `USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`. If disabled and your compiler fully supports separate user paths, user headers are only accessible with `#include \"header.h\"`-style preprocessor directives.\n\nFor backwards compatibility reasons, this setting is enabled by default. Disabling it is strongly recommended.\n\n### Require Only App-Extension-Safe API\n\n**Setting name:** `APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY`\n\nWhen enabled, this causes the compiler and linker to disallow use of APIs that are not available to app extensions and to disallow linking to frameworks that have not been built with this setting enabled.\n\n### Convert Copied Files\n\n**Setting name:** `APPLY_RULES_IN_COPY_FILES`\n\nEnabling this setting will cause files in the target’s Copy Files build phases to be processed by build rules. For example, property list files (`.plist`) and strings files will be converted as specified by `PLIST_FILE_OUTPUT_FORMAT` and `STRINGS_FILE_OUTPUT_ENCODING`, respectively.\n\n### Process Header Files\n\n**Setting name:** `APPLY_RULES_IN_COPY_HEADERS`\n\nEnabling this setting will cause all Public and Private headers in the target’s Copy Headers build phase to be processed by build rules. This allows custom build rules to be defined to process these headers. Custom script rules can define their outputs relative to `HEADER_OUTPUT_DIR`, which will be provided to that script, taking the header visibility into account. The scripts are also passed `SCRIPT_HEADER_VISIBILITY` (“public” or “private”). Files that should not be processed by build rules may need to be moved to a Copy Files build phase when this setting is enabled.\n\n### Enable App Shortcuts Flexible Matching\n\n**Setting name:** `APP_SHORTCUTS_ENABLE_FLEXIBLE_MATCHING`\n\nWhen enabled, generates assets needed for App Shortcuts Flexible Matching.\n\n### Architectures\n\n**Setting name:** `ARCHS`\n\nA list of the architectures for which the product will be built. This is usually set to a predefined build setting provided by the platform. If more than one architecture is specified, a universal binary will be produced.\n\n### Alternate App Icon Sets\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_ALTERNATE_APPICON_NAMES`\n\nA set of additional app icon set names to include as in the built product. The icons will be available at runtime for use as alternate app icons. This is an alternative to `--include-all-app-icons` providing more detailed control.\n\n### Primary App Icon Set Name\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME`\n\nName of an app icon set for the target’s default app icon. The contents will be merged into the `Info.plist`.\n\n### Watch Complication Name\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_COMPLICATION_NAME`\n\nThe name of a watch complication to use from the asset catalog.\n\n### Generate Asset Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_GENERATE_ASSET_SYMBOLS`\n\nGenerate asset symbols for each color and image in the catalog.\n\n### Generate Swift Asset Symbol Framework Support\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_GENERATE_ASSET_SYMBOL_FRAMEWORKS`\n\nGenerate asset symbol support for the specified UI frameworks (e.g. SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit).\n\n### Generate Swift Asset Symbol Extensions\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_GENERATE_SWIFT_ASSET_SYMBOL_EXTENSIONS`\n\nGenerate asset symbol extensions on Apple framework color and image types.\n\n### Global Accent Color Name\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_GLOBAL_ACCENT_COLOR_NAME`\n\nThe name of a color resource to use as a the target’s accent color, used as the default tint color on iOS and watchOS, and accent color on macOS.\n\n### Include All App Icon Assets\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_INCLUDE_ALL_APPICON_ASSETS`\n\nWhen true, all app icon assets from the target’s Asset Catalogs will be included in the built product, making the available at runtime for use as alternate app icons. When false, only the primary app icon will be included in the built product.\n\n### Include Asset Localizations in Info.plist\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_INCLUDE_INFOPLIST_LOCALIZATIONS`\n\nWhen enabled, includes the localization information of the selected assets in the generated partial Info.plist file under the CFBundleLocalizations key. This will allow the assets to be used at runtime in the absence of a corresponding lproj directory in the bundle.\n\n### Asset Catalog Launch Image Set Name\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_LAUNCHIMAGE_NAME`\n\nName of an asset catalog launch image set whose contents will be merged into the `Info.plist`.\n\n### Leaderboard Identifier Prefix\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_LEADERBOARD_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX`\n\nLeaderboards in the asset catalog may optionally specify a Game Center identifier. If they do not, their name will be prefixed by this value to form an automatically generated identifier.\n\n### Leaderboard Set Identifier Prefix\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_LEADERBOARD_SET_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX`\n\nLeaderboard sets in the asset catalog may optionally specify a Game Center identifier. If they do not, their name will be prefixed by this value to form an automatically generated identifier.\n\n### Optimization\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION`\n\nWith no value, the compiler uses the default optimization. You can also specify `time` to optimize for speed of access or `space` to optimize for a smaller compiled asset catalogs.\n\n### Skip App Store Deployment\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_SKIP_APP_STORE_DEPLOYMENT`\n\nWhether to perform App Store-specific behaviors such as validations. For example, building for an iOS or watchOS app will warn if a 1024 App Store icon is not present, but only when compiling for App Store deployment.\n\n### Standalone Icon File Behavior\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_STANDALONE_ICON_BEHAVIOR`\n\nControls whether loose PNG or ICNS files are created for the primary app icon, in addition to including the content in the Assets.car file. By default, a small subset of sizes are included as loose files, allowing external management tools to display a representative icon without reading the CAR file. This can be set to ‘all’ or ‘none’ to include more or fewer icon sizes as loose files.\n\n### Sticker Pack Identifier Prefix\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_STICKER_PACK_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX`\n\nSticker Packs in the asset catalog may optionally specify an identifier. If they do not, their name will be prefixed by this value to form an automatically generated identifier.\n\n### Widget Background Color Name\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_WIDGET_BACKGROUND_COLOR_NAME`\n\nThe name of a color resource to use as the background color for a widget.\n\n### Show Notices\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_NOTICES`\n\nShow notices encountered during the compilation of asset catalogs.\n\n### Asset Catalog Other Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_OTHER_FLAGS`\n\nPass additional flags through to the asset catalog compiler.\n\n### Show Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_WARNINGS`\n\nShow warnings encountered during the compilation of asset catalogs.\n\n### Asset Pack Manifest URL Prefix\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSET_PACK_MANIFEST_URL_PREFIX`\n\nIf set to anything other than the empty string, every URL in the `AssetPackManifest.plist` file will consist of this string with the name of the asset pack appended. If not set, the URLs in the `AssetPackManifest.plist` will be formed as appropriate for the build location of the asset packs. The prefix string is not escaped or quoted in any way, so any necessary escaping must be part of the URL string. This setting affects only URLs in the `AssetPackManifest.plist` file — it does not affect where asset packs are built in the local file system.\n\n### Apple Events\n\n**Setting name:** `AUTOMATION_APPLE_EVENTS`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app may prompt the user for permission to send Apple events to other apps.\n\n### Active Build Components\n\n**Setting name:** `BUILD_COMPONENTS`\n\nA list of components being built during this action.\n\n### Build Libraries for Distribution\n\n**Setting name:** `BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION`\n\nEnsures that your libraries are built for distribution. For Swift, this enables support for library evolution and generation of a module interface file.\n\n### Build Variants\n\n**Setting name:** `BUILD_VARIANTS`\n\nA list of the build variants of the linked binary that will be produced. By default, only the `normal` variant is produced. Other common values include `debug` and `profile`.\n\n### BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR`\n\nIdentifies the directory under which all the product’s files can be found. This directory contains either product files or symbolic links to them. Run Script build phases can use the value of this build setting as a convenient way to refer to the product files built by one or more targets even when these files are scattered throughout a directory hierarchy (for example, when `DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION` is set to `YES`.\n\n### Bundle Loader\n\n**Setting name:** `BUNDLE_LOADER`\n\nSpecifies the executable that will load the bundle output file being linked. Undefined symbols from the bundle are checked against the specified executable as if it is one of the dynamic libraries the bundle was linked with.\n\n### Enable C++ Container Overflow Checks\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ADDRESS_SANITIZER_CONTAINER_OVERFLOW`\n\nCheck for C++ container overflow when Address Sanitizer is enabled. This check requires the entire application to be built with Address Sanitizer. If not, it may report false positives.\n\n### Allow Non-modular Includes In Framework Modules\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ALLOW_NON_MODULAR_INCLUDES_IN_FRAMEWORK_MODULES`\n\nEnabling this setting allows non-modular includes to be used from within framework modules. This is inherently unsafe, as such headers might cause duplicate definitions when used by any client that imports both the framework and the non-modular includes.\n\n### Dead Stores\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_DEADCODE_DEADSTORES`\n\nCheck for values stored to variables and never read again.\n\n### Division by Zero\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO`\n\nCheck for division by zero.\n\n### Misuse of Grand Central Dispatch\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_GCD`\n\nCheck for misuses of the Grand Central Dispatch API.\n\n### Performance Anti-Patterns with Grand Central Dispatch\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_GCD_PERFORMANCE`\n\nCheck for Grand Central Dispatch idioms that may lead to poor performance.\n\n### Violation of IOKit and libkern Reference Counting Rules\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_LIBKERN_RETAIN_COUNT`\n\nFinds leaks and over-releases associated with objects inheriting from OSObject.\n\n### Missing Localization Context Comment\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_LOCALIZABILITY_EMPTY_CONTEXT`\n\nWarn when a call to an `NSLocalizedString()` macro is missing a context comment for the localizer.\n\n### Missing Localizability\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_LOCALIZABILITY_NONLOCALIZED`\n\nWarn when a nonlocalized string is passed to a user interface method expecting a localized string.\n\n### Improper Memory Management\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT`\n\nWarn about memory leaks, use-after-free, and other API misuses.\n\n### Violation of Mach Interface Generator Conventions\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_MIG_CONVENTIONS`\n\nWarn when a MIG routine violates memory management conventions.\n\n### Misuse of ‘nonnull’\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_NONNULL`\n\nCheck for misuses of `nonnull` parameter and return types.\n\n### Dereference of Null Pointers\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_NULL_DEREFERENCE`\n\nCheck for dereferences of null pointers.\n\n### Suspicious Conversions of NSNumber and CFNumberRef\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_NUMBER_OBJECT_CONVERSION`\n\nWarn when a number object, such as an instance of `NSNumber`, `CFNumberRef`, `OSNumber`, or `OSBoolean` is compared or converted to a primitive value instead of another object.\n\n### @synchronized with nil mutex\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_ATSYNC`\n\nWarn on `nil` pointers used as mutexes for `@synchronized`.\n\n### Misuse of Collections API\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_COLLECTIONS`\n\nWarn if `CF` collections are created with non-pointer-size values. Check if `NS` collections are initialized with non-Objective-C type elements.\n\n### Improper Instance Cleanup in ‘-dealloc’\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_DEALLOC`\n\nWarn when an instance is improperly cleaned up in `-dealloc`.\n\n### Misuse of Objective-C generics\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_GENERICS`\n\nWarn if a specialized generic type is converted to an incompatible type.\n\n### Method Signatures Mismatch\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_INCOMP_METHOD_TYPES`\n\nWarn about Objective-C method signatures with type incompatibilities.\n\n### Improper Handling of CFError and NSError\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_NSCFERROR`\n\nWarn if functions accepting `CFErrorRef` or `NSError` cannot indicate that an error occurred.\n\n### Violation of Reference Counting Rules\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_RETAIN_COUNT`\n\nWarn on leaks and improper reference count management.\n\n### Violation of ‘self = [super init]’ Rule\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_SELF_INIT`\n\nCheck that `super init` is properly called within an Objective-C initialization method.\n\n### Unused Ivars\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OBJC_UNUSED_IVARS`\n\nWarn about private ivars that are never used.\n\n### C-style Downcasts of IOKit Objects\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_OSOBJECT_C_STYLE_CAST`\n\nWarn when a C-style cast is used for downcasting a pointer to an OSObject. RTTI-aware casts (OSRequiredCast, OSDynamicCast) are more secure and should be used instead of C-style casts in order to avoid potential type confusion attacks.\n\n### EXPERIMENTAL Buffer overflows\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_EXPERIMENTAL`\n\nCheck for potential buffer overflows.\n\n### Floating Point Value Used as Loop Counter\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_FLOATLOOPCOUNTER`\n\nWarn on using a floating point value as a loop counter (CERT: FLP30-C, FLP30-CPP).\n\n### Use of ‘getpw’, ‘gets’ (Buffer Overflow)\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_INSECUREAPI_GETPW_GETS`\n\nWarn on uses of `getpw` and `gets`. The functions are dangerous as they may trigger a buffer overflow.\n\n### Use of ‘mktemp’ or Predictable ‘mktemps’\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_INSECUREAPI_MKSTEMP`\n\nWarn on uses of `mktemp`, which produces predictable temporary files. It is obsoleted by `mktemps`. Warn when `mkstemp` is passed fewer than 6 `X`’s in the format string.\n\n### Use of ‘rand’ Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_INSECUREAPI_RAND`\n\nWarn on uses of `rand`, `random`, and related functions, which produce predictable random number sequences. Use `arc4random` instead.\n\n### Use of ‘strcpy’ and ‘strcat’\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_INSECUREAPI_STRCPY`\n\nWarn on uses of the `strcpy` and `strcat` functions, which can result in buffer overflows. Use `strlcpy` or `strlcat` instead.\n\n### Unchecked Return Values\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_INSECUREAPI_UNCHECKEDRETURN`\n\nWarn on uses of sensitive functions whose return values must be always checked.\n\n### Use of ‘vfork’\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_INSECUREAPI_VFORK`\n\nWarn on uses of the `vfork` function, which is inherently insecure. Use the safer `posix_spawn` function instead.\n\n### Misuse of Keychain Services API\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_SECURITY_KEYCHAIN_API`\n\nCheck for leaks of keychain attribute lists and data buffers returned by the Keychain Services API.\n\n### Use-After-Move Errors in C++\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ANALYZER_USE_AFTER_MOVE`\n\nWarn when a C++ object is used after it has been moved from.\n\n### C++ Language Dialect\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_CXX_LANGUAGE_STANDARD`\n\nChoose a standard or non-standard C++ language dialect. Options include:\n\n### Enable C++ Standard Library Hardening\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARY_HARDENING`\n\nEnable hardening in the C++ standard library.\n\nAvailable values:\n\nThis setting defines the value of the `_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE` preprocessor macro.\n\n### Debug Information Level\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_DEBUG_INFORMATION_LEVEL`\n\nToggles the amount of debug information emitted when debug symbols are enabled. This can impact the size of the generated debug information, which may matter in some cases for large projects, such as when using LTO.\n\n### Enable Typed Allocator in C++\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_CPLUSPLUS_TYPED_ALLOCATOR_SUPPORT`\n\nEnables compiler rewriting of allocation calls in C++ to provide type information to the allocator. Mitigates use-after-free security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Destroy Static Objects\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_CPP_STATIC_DESTRUCTORS`\n\nControls whether variables with static or thread storage duration should have their exit-time destructors run.\n\n### Enable Typed Allocator in C\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_C_TYPED_ALLOCATOR_SUPPORT`\n\nEnables compiler rewriting of allocation calls in C to provide type information to the allocator. Mitigates use-after-free security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Enable Modules (C and Objective-C)\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES`\n\nEnables the use of modules for system APIs. System headers are imported as semantic modules instead of raw headers. This can result in faster builds and project indexing.\n\n### Enable Clang Module Debugging\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_MODULE_DEBUGGING`\n\nWhen this setting is enabled, `clang` will use the shared debug info available in `clang` modules and precompiled headers. This results in smaller build artifacts, faster compile times, and more complete debug info. This setting should only be disabled when building static libraries with debug info for distribution.\n\n### Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC`\n\nCompiles reference-counted Objective-C code to use Automatic Reference Counting. Code compiled using automated reference counting is compatible with other code (such as frameworks) compiled using either manual reference counting (for example, traditional `retain` and `release` messages) or automated reference counting. [-fobjc-arc]\n\n### Enable Objective-C ARC Exceptions\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC_EXCEPTIONS`\n\nThis setting causes clang to use exception-handler-safe code when synthesizing retains and releases when using ARC. Without this, ARC is not exception-safe. Only applies to Objective-C. [-fobjc-arc-exceptions]\n\n### Weak References in Manual Retain Release\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_WEAK`\n\nCompiles Objective-C code to enable weak references for code compiled with manual retain release (MRR) semantics.\n\n### Enable Stack Zero Initialization\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_ENABLE_STACK_ZERO_INIT`\n\nAutomatically initializes stack variables to zero as a security protection.\n\n### Implicitly Link Objective-C Runtime Support\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_LINK_OBJC_RUNTIME`\n\nWhen linking a target using Objective-C code, implicitly link in Foundation (and if deploying back to an older OS) a backwards compatibility library to allow newer language features to run on an OS where the runtime support is not natively available. Most targets that use Objective-C should use this, although there are rare cases where a target should opt out of this behavior.\n\n### Link Frameworks Automatically\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_MODULES_AUTOLINK`\n\nAutomatically link SDK frameworks that are referenced using `#import` or `#include`. This feature requires also enabling support for modules. This build setting only applies to C-family languages.\n\n### Disable Private Modules Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_MODULES_DISABLE_PRIVATE_WARNING`\n\nDisable warnings related to the recommended use of private module naming. This only makes sense when support for modules is enabled.\n\n### Optimization Profile File\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_OPTIMIZATION_PROFILE_FILE`\n\nThe path to the file of the profile data to use when `CLANG_USE_OPTIMIZATION_PROFILE` is enabled.\n\n### Mode of Analysis for ‘Build’\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_STATIC_ANALYZER_MODE`\n\nThe depth the static analyzer uses during the Build action. Use `Deep` to exercise the full power of the analyzer. Use `Shallow` for faster analysis.\n\n### Mode of Analysis for ‘Analyze’\n\n**Setting name:** `CLANG_STATIC_ANALYZER_MODE_ON_ANALYZE_ACTION`\n\nThe depth the static analyzer uses during the Analyze action. Use `Deep` to exercise the full power of the analyzer.

Adds an additional architectural slice (arm64e) with pointer authentication instructions.\n\n### Audio Input\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_AUDIO_INPUT`\n\nWhen set, enables capture of audio with the built-in and external microphones.\n\n### Bluetooth\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_BLUETOOTH`\n\nWhen set, enables communication with connected Bluetooth devices.\n\n### Calendar\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_CALENDARS`\n\nWhen set, enables read-write access to the user’s calendar.\n\n### Camera\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_CAMERA`\n\nWhen set, enables capture of images and movies with the built-in and external cameras.\n\n### Contacts\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_CONTACTS`\n\nWhen set, enables read-write access to the user’s Contacts database.\n\n### Location\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_LOCATION`\n\nWhen set, enables access to determine the user’s location using Location Services.\n\n### Photos Library\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_PHOTO_LIBRARY`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app has read-write access to the user’s Photos library.\n\n### Printing\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_PRINTING`\n\nWhen set, enables access to print documents and media using the system’s configured printers.\n\n### USB\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_RESOURCE_ACCESS_USB`\n\nWhen set, enables communication with connected USB devices.\n\n### Enable Security-Relevant Compiler Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_SECURITY_COMPILER_WARNINGS`\n\nEnables a set of security-relevant compiler warnings that check for common bounds-safety and lifetime-safety issues.\n\n### Enable Strict Checking of objc_msgSend Calls\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_STRICT_OBJC_MSGSEND`\n\nControls whether `objc_msgSend` calls must be cast to the appropriate function pointer type before being called.\n\n### Enable Testability\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_TESTABILITY`\n\nEnabling this setting will build the target with options appropriate for running automated tests against its product.\n\nThis setting can be enabled when building targets for debugging if their products will be tested. This may result in tests running slower than otherwise.\n\nWhen this setting is enabled:\n\n### Enable Testing Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_TESTING_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nSpecifies whether the build system should add the search paths necessary for compiling and linking against testing-related libraries or frameworks. This setting is enabled by default if the target is a test target or if the target explicitly links to the Testing, XCTest, or StoreKitTest frameworks.\n\n### User Script Sandboxing\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING`\n\nIf enabled, the build system will sandbox user scripts to disallow undeclared input\/output dependencies.\n\n### Enable User Selected Files\n\n**Setting name:** `ENABLE_USER_SELECTED_FILES`\n\nThis setting indicates whether App Sandbox allows access to files the user selects with an Open or Save dialog.\n\n### Excluded Architectures\n\n**Setting name:** `EXCLUDED_ARCHS`\n\nA list of architectures for which the target should not be built. These architectures will be removed from the list in `ARCHS` when the target is built. If the resulting list of architectures is empty, no binary will be produced. This can be used to declare architectures a target does not support for use in environments where `ARCHS` is being overridden at a higher level (e.g., via `xcodebuild`).\n\n### Excluded Explicit Target Dependencies\n\n**Setting name:** `EXCLUDED_EXPLICIT_TARGET_DEPENDENCIES`\n\nA list of patterns (as defined by `fnmatch(3)`) specifying the names of explicit target dependencies to *exclude* when determining which targets to build (see also `INCLUDED_EXPLICIT_TARGET_DEPENDENCIES`). This setting can be used to define complex filters for which targets should be built in response to other build settings.\n\n### Sub-Directories to Exclude in Recursive Searches\n\n**Setting name:** `EXCLUDED_RECURSIVE_SEARCH_PATH_SUBDIRECTORIES`\n\nThis is a list of `fnmatch()`-style patterns of file or directory names to exclude when performing a recursive search. By default, this is set to `*.nib *.lproj *.framework *.gch *.xcode* *.xcassets *.icon (*) .DS_Store CVS .svn .git .hg *.pbproj *.pbxproj`. Normally, if you override this value you should include the default values via the `$(inherited)` macro.\n\n### Excluded Source File Names\n\n**Setting name:** `EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES`\n\nA list of patterns (as defined by `fnmatch(3)`) specifying the names of source files to explicitly *exclude* when processing the files in the target’s build phases (see also `INCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES`). This setting can be used to define complex filters for which files from the phase should be built in response to other build settings; for example, a value of `*.$(CURRENT_ARCH).c` could serve to exclude particular files based on the architecture being built.\n\n### EXECUTABLES_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `EXECUTABLES_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nIdentifies the directory that contains additional binary files.\n\n### Executable Extension\n\n**Setting name:** `EXECUTABLE_EXTENSION`\n\nThis is the extension used for the executable product generated by the target, which has a default value based on the product type.\n\n### EXECUTABLE_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `EXECUTABLE_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nIdentifies the directory that contains the binary the target builds.\n\n### EXECUTABLE_NAME\n\n**Setting name:** `EXECUTABLE_NAME`\n\nSpecifies the name of the binary the target produces.\n\nWhen `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` is enabled, sets the value of the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/bundleresources\/information_property_list\/cfbundleexecutable] key in the `Info.plist` file to the value of this build setting.\n\n### EXECUTABLE_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `EXECUTABLE_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the path to the binary the target produces within its bundle.\n\n### Executable Prefix\n\n**Setting name:** `EXECUTABLE_PREFIX`\n\nThe prefix used for the executable product generated by the target, which has a default value based on the product type.\n\n### EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX\n\n**Setting name:** `EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX`\n\nSpecifies the suffix of the binary filename, including the character that separates the extension from the rest of the bundle name.\n\n### Exported Symbols File\n\n**Setting name:** `EXPORTED_SYMBOLS_FILE`\n\nThis is a project-relative path to a file that lists the symbols to export. See `ld -exported_symbols_list` for details on exporting symbols.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the directory that contains the product’s embedded frameworks.\n\n### Framework Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to folders containing frameworks to be searched by the compiler for both included or imported header files when compiling C, Objective-C, C++, or Objective-C++, and by the linker for frameworks used by the product. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them must be properly quoted.\n\n### Framework Version\n\n**Setting name:** `FRAMEWORK_VERSION`\n\nFramework bundles are versioned by having contents in subfolders of a version folder that has links to the current version and its contents.\n\n### Run Build Script Phases in Parallel\n\n**Setting name:** `FUSE_BUILD_SCRIPT_PHASES`\n\nIf enabled, consecutive run script phases will be allowed to run in parallel if they fully specify their input and output dependencies.\n\n### ‘char’ Type Is Unsigned\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_CHAR_IS_UNSIGNED_CHAR`\n\nEnabling this setting causes `char` to be unsigned by default, disabling it causes `char` to be signed by default.\n\n### CodeWarrior\/MS-Style Inline Assembly\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_CW_ASM_SYNTAX`\n\nEnable the CodeWarrior\/Microsoft syntax for inline assembly code in addition to the standard GCC syntax.\n\n### C Language Dialect\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_C_LANGUAGE_STANDARD`\n\nChoose a standard or non-standard C language dialect.\n\n### Generate Position-Dependent Code\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_DYNAMIC_NO_PIC`\n\nFaster function calls for applications. Not appropriate for shared libraries, which need to be position-independent.\n\n### Allow ‘asm’, ‘inline’, ‘typeof’\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_ASM_KEYWORD`\n\nControls whether `asm`, `inline`, and `typeof` are treated as keywords or whether they can be used as identifiers.\n\n### Recognize Builtin Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS`\n\nControls whether builtin functions that do not begin with `__builtin_` as prefix are recognized.\n\nGCC normally generates special code to handle certain builtin functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to `alloca` may become single instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to `memcpy` may become inline copy loops. The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different library. In addition, when a function is recognized as a builtin function, GCC may use information about that function to warn about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function. For example, warnings are given with `-Wformat` for bad calls to `printf`, when `printf` is built in, and `strlen` is known not to modify global memory.\n\n### Enable C++ Exceptions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_CPP_EXCEPTIONS`\n\nEnable C++ exception handling. Generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution. If you do not specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like C++ that normally require exception handling, and disable it for languages like C that do not normally require it. However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in C++.\n\n### Enable C++ Runtime Types\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_CPP_RTTI`\n\nEnable generation of information about every class with virtual functions for use by the C++ runtime type identification features (`dynamic_cast` and `typeid`). If you don’t use those parts of the language, you can save some space by using this flag. Note that exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as needed.\n\n### Enable Exceptions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS`\n\nEnable exception handling. Generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution. If you do not specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like C++ and Objective-C that normally require exception handling, and disable it for languages like C that do not normally require it. However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in other languages. You may also wish to disable this option if you are compiling older programs that don’t use exception handling.\n\n### Generate Floating Point Library Calls\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_FLOATING_POINT_LIBRARY_CALLS`\n\nGenerate output containing library calls for floating point.\n\n### Kernel Development Mode\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_KERNEL_DEVELOPMENT`\n\nActivating this setting enables kernel development mode.\n\n### Enable Objective-C Exceptions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS`\n\nThis setting enables `@try`\/`@catch`\/`@throw` syntax for handling exceptions in Objective-C code. Only applies to Objective-C. [-fobjc-exceptions]\n\n### Recognize Pascal Strings\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_PASCAL_STRINGS`\n\nRecognize and construct Pascal-style string literals. Its use in new code is discouraged.\n\nPascal string literals take the form `\"\\pstring\"` . The special escape sequence `\\p` denotes the Pascal length byte for the string, and will be replaced at compile time with the number of characters that follow. The `\\p` may only appear at the beginning of a string literal, and may not appear in wide string literals or as an integral constant.\n\n### Enable SSE3 Extensions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_SSE3_EXTENSIONS`\n\nSpecifies whether the binary uses the builtin functions that provide access to the SSE3 extensions to the IA-32 architecture.\n\n### Enable SSE4.1 Extensions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_SSE41_EXTENSIONS`\n\nSpecifies whether the binary uses the builtin functions that provide access to the SSE4.1 extensions to the IA-32 architecture.\n\n### Enable SSE4.2 Extensions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_SSE42_EXTENSIONS`\n\nSpecifies whether the binary uses the builtin functions that provide access to the SSE4.2 extensions to the IA-32 architecture.\n\n### Enable Trigraphs\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_TRIGRAPHS`\n\nControls whether or not trigraphs are permitted in the source code.\n\n### Relax IEEE Compliance\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_FAST_MATH`\n\nEnables some floating point optimizations that are not IEEE754-compliant, but which usually work. Programs that require strict IEEE compliance may not work with this option.\n\n### Generate Debug Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS`\n\nEnables or disables generation of debug symbols. When debug symbols are enabled, the level of detail can be controlled by the `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` setting.\n\n### Generate Legacy Test Coverage Files\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES`\n\nActivating this setting causes a `notes` file to be produced that the `gcov` code-coverage utility can use to show program coverage.\n\n### Increase Sharing of Precompiled Headers\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_INCREASE_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_SHARING`\n\nEnabling this option will enable increased sharing of precompiled headers among targets that share the same prefix header and precompiled header directory.\n\nXcode distinguishes between precompiled header (PCH) files by generating a hash value based on the command-line options to the compiler used to create the PCH. Enabling this option will exclude certain compiler options from that hash. Presently this option will exclude search path options (`-I`, `-iquote`, `-isystem`, `-F`, `-L`) from the hash.\n\nEnabling increased sharing of PCH files carries some risk—if two targets use the same prefix header but have different include paths that cause the prefix header to include different files when they are precompiled, then subtle problems may result because one target will use a PCH that was built using files included by the other target. In this case, this option must be turned off in order to enforce correctness.\n\n### Inline Methods Hidden\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_INLINES_ARE_PRIVATE_EXTERN`\n\nWhen enabled, out-of-line copies of inline methods are declared `private extern`.\n\n### Compile Sources As\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_INPUT_FILETYPE`\n\nSpecifies whether to compile each source file according to its file type, or whether to treat all source files in the target as if they are of a specific language.\n\n### Instrument Program Flow\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS`\n\nActivating this setting indicates that code should be added so program flow arcs are instrumented.\n\n### Enable Linking With Shared Libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_LINK_WITH_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES`\n\nEnabling this option allows linking with the shared libraries. This is the default for most product types.\n\n### No Common Blocks\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_NO_COMMON_BLOCKS`\n\nIn C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file, rather than generating them as common blocks. This has the effect that if the same variable is declared (without `extern`) in two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.\n\n### Optimization Level\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`\n\nSpecifies the degree to which the generated code is optimized for speed and binary size.\n\n### Precompile Prefix Header\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_PRECOMPILE_PREFIX_HEADER`\n\nGenerates a precompiled header for the prefix header, which should reduce overall build times.\n\nPrecompiling the prefix header will be most effective if the contents of the prefix header or any file it includes change rarely. If the contents of the prefix header or any file it includes change frequently, there may be a negative impact to overall build time.\n\n### Prefix Header\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_PREFIX_HEADER`\n\nImplicitly include the named header. The path given should either be a project relative path or an absolute path.\n\n### Preprocessor Macros\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`\n\nSpace-separated list of preprocessor macros of the form `foo` or `foo=bar`.\n\n### Preprocessor Macros Not Used In Precompiled Headers\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS_NOT_USED_IN_PRECOMPS`\n\nSpace-separated list of preprocessor macros of the form `foo` or `foo=bar`. These macros are not used when precompiling a prefix header file.\n\n### Make Strings Read-Only\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_REUSE_STRINGS`\n\nReuse string literals.\n\n### Short Enumeration Constants\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_SHORT_ENUMS`\n\nMake enums only as large as needed for the range of possible values.\n\nThis setting generates code that may not binary compatible with code generated without this setting or with macOS frameworks.\n\n### Enforce Strict Aliasing\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_STRICT_ALIASING`\n\nOptimize code by making more aggressive assumptions about whether pointers can point to the same objects as other pointers. Programs that use pointers a lot may benefit from this, but programs that don’t strictly follow the ISO C rules about the type with which an object may be accessed may behave unexpectedly.\n\n### Symbols Hidden by Default\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN`\n\nWhen enabled, all symbols are declared `private extern` unless explicitly marked to be exported using `__attribute__((visibility(\"default\")))` in code. If not enabled, all symbols are exported unless explicitly marked as `private extern`. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/CppRuntimeEnv\/Articles\/SymbolVisibility.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40001670-CJBGBHEJ] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/CppRuntimeEnv\/CPPRuntimeEnv.html].\n\n### Statics are Thread-Safe\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_THREADSAFE_STATICS`\n\nEmits extra code to use the routines specified in the C++ ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics. You can disable this option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn’t need to be thread-safe.\n\n### Treat Missing Function Prototypes as Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_TREAT_IMPLICIT_FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS_AS_ERRORS`\n\nCauses warnings about missing function prototypes to be treated as errors. Only applies to C and Objective-C.\n\n### Treat Incompatible Pointer Type Warnings as Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_TREAT_INCOMPATIBLE_POINTER_TYPE_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`\n\nEnabling this option causes warnings about incompatible pointer types to be treated as errors.\n\n### Treat Warnings as Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`\n\nEnabling this option causes all warnings to be treated as errors.\n\n### Unroll Loops\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_UNROLL_LOOPS`\n\nUnrolls loops. Unrolling makes the code larger, but may make it faster by reducing the number of branches executed.\n\n### Use Standard System Header Directory Searching\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_USE_STANDARD_INCLUDE_SEARCHING`\n\nControls whether the standard system directories are searched for header files. When disabled, only the directories you have specified with `-I` options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.\n\n### Compiler for C\/C++\/Objective-C\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_VERSION`\n\nThe compiler to use for C, C++, and Objective-C.\n\n### Implicit Conversion to 32 Bit Type\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_64_TO_32_BIT_CONVERSION`\n\nWarn if a value is implicitly converted from a 64-bit type to a 32-bit type. This is a subset of the warnings provided by -Wconversion.\n\n### Deprecated Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS`\n\nWarn about the use of deprecated functions, variables, and types (as indicated by the `deprecated` attribute).\n\n### Undefined Use of offsetof Macro\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_INVALID_OFFSETOF_MACRO`\n\nUnchecking this setting will suppress warnings from applying the `offsetof` macro to a non-POD type. According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying `offsetof` to a non-POD type is undefined. In existing C++ implementations, however, `offsetof` typically gives meaningful results even when applied to certain kinds of non-POD types, such as a simple struct that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a constructor. This flag is for users who are aware that they are writing non-portable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the warning about it.\n\nThe restrictions on `offsetof` may be relaxed in a future version of the C++ standard.\n\n### Missing Fields in Structure Initializers\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_FIELD_INITIALIZERS`\n\nWarn if a structure’s initializer has some fields missing. For example, the following code would cause such a warning because `x.h` is implicitly zero:\n\nThis option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following modification would not trigger a warning:\n\n### Missing Newline At End Of File\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_NEWLINE`\n\nWarn when a source file does not end with a newline.\n\n### Missing Function Prototypes\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_PROTOTYPES`\n\nCauses warnings to be emitted about missing prototypes.\n\n### Pointer Sign Comparison\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_POINTER_SIGNEDNESS`\n\nWarn when pointers passed via arguments or assigned to a variable differ in sign.\n\n### Mismatched Return Type\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_RETURN_TYPE`\n\nCauses warnings to be emitted when a function with a defined return type (not `void`) contains a return statement without a return-value or when it does not contain any return statements. Also emits a warning when a function with a void return type tries to return a value.\n\n### Incomplete Objective-C Protocols\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ALLOW_INCOMPLETE_PROTOCOL`\n\nWarn if methods required by a protocol are not implemented in the class adopting it. Only applies to Objective-C.\n\n### Check Switch Statements\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_CHECK_SWITCH_STATEMENTS`\n\nWarn whenever a switch statement has an index of enumeral type and lacks a case for one or more of the named codes of that enumeration. The presence of a default label prevents this warning. Case labels outside the enumeration range also provoke warnings when this option is used.\n\n### Four Character Literals\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_FOUR_CHARACTER_CONSTANTS`\n\nWarn about four-char literals (for example, macOS-style `OSTypes`: `'APPL'`).\n\n### Overloaded Virtual Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_HIDDEN_VIRTUAL_FUNCTIONS`\n\nWarn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a base class.\n\nFor example, in the following example, the `A` class version of `f()` is hidden in `B`.\n\nAs a result, the following code will fail to compile.\n\nThis setting only applies to C++ and Objective-C++ sources.\n\n### Inhibit All Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_INHIBIT_ALL_WARNINGS`\n\nInhibit all warning messages.\n\n### Initializer Not Fully Bracketed\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_INITIALIZER_NOT_FULLY_BRACKETED`\n\nWarn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed. In the following example, the initializer for `a` is not fully bracketed, but the initializer for `b` is fully bracketed.\n\n### Missing Braces and Parentheses\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_MISSING_PARENTHESES`\n\nWarn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence causes confusion. Also, warn about constructions where there may be confusion as to which `if` statement an `else` branch belongs. For example:\n\nIn C, every `else` branch belongs to the innermost possible `if` statement, which in the example above is `if (b)`. This is often not what the programmer expects, as illustrated by indentation used in the example above. This build setting causes GCC to issue a warning when there is the potential for this confusion. To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost `if` statement so there is no way the `else` could belong to the enclosing `if`. For example:\n\n### Nonvirtual Destructor\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_NON_VIRTUAL_DESTRUCTOR`\n\nWarn when a class declares an nonvirtual destructor that should probably be virtual, because it looks like the class will be used polymorphically. This is only active for C++ or Objective-C++ sources.\n\n### Pedantic Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_PEDANTIC`\n\nIssue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any `-std` option used.\n\n### Hidden Local Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_SHADOW`\n\nWarn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable, parameter or global variable or whenever a builtin function is shadowed.\n\n### Sign Comparison\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_SIGN_COMPARE`\n\nWarn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.\n\n### Strict Selector Matching\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_STRICT_SELECTOR_MATCH`\n\nWarn if multiple methods with differing argument and\/or return types are found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this selector to a receiver of type `id` or `Class`. When this setting is disabled, the compiler will omit such warnings if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size and alignment.\n\n### Typecheck Calls to printf\/scanf\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_TYPECHECK_CALLS_TO_PRINTF`\n\nCheck calls to `printf` and `scanf` to make sure that the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make sense.\n\n### Undeclared Selector\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNDECLARED_SELECTOR`\n\nWarn if a `@selector(...)` expression referring to an undeclared selector is found. A selector is considered undeclared if no method with that name has been declared before the `@selector(...)` expression, either explicitly in an `@interface` or `@protocol` declaration, or implicitly in an `@implementation` section. This option always performs its checks as soon as a `@selector(...)` expression is found, while `-Wselector` only performs its checks in the final stage of compilation. This also enforces the coding style convention that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.\n\n### Uninitialized Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNINITIALIZED_AUTOS`\n\nWarn if a variable might be clobbered by a `setjmp` call or if an automatic variable is used without prior initialization.\n\nThe compiler may not detect all cases where an automatic variable is initialized or all usage patterns that may lead to use prior to initialization. You can toggle between the normal uninitialized value checking or the more aggressive (conservative) checking, which finds more issues but the checking is much stricter.\n\n### Unknown Pragma\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNKNOWN_PRAGMAS`\n\nWarn when a `#pragma` directive is encountered that is not understood by GCC. If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued for unknown pragmas in system header files. This is not the case if the warnings were only enabled by the `-Wall` command-line option.\n\n### Unused Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_FUNCTION`\n\nWarn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a non-inline static function is unused.\n\n### Unused Labels\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_LABEL`\n\nWarn whenever a label is declared but not used.\n\n### Unused Parameters\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_PARAMETER`\n\nWarn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.\n\n### Unused Values\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_VALUE`\n\nWarn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.\n\n### Unused Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_VARIABLE`\n\nWarn whenever a local variable or nonconstant static variable is unused aside from its declaration.\n\n### Generate Info.plist File\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE`\n\nAutomatically generate an Info.plist file.\n\n### Enable Intermediate Text-Based Stubs Generation\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_INTERMEDIATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS`\n\nEnables the generation of intermediate Text-Based stubs for dynamic libraries and frameworks to more precisely track linker dependencies in incremental builds.\n\n### Force Package Info Generation\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_PKGINFO_FILE`\n\nForces the `PkgInfo` file to be written to wrapped products even if this file is not expected.\n\n### Perform Single-Object Prelink\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_PRELINK_OBJECT_FILE`\n\nActivating this setting will cause the object files built by a target to be prelinked using `ld -r` into a single object file, and that object file will then be linked into the final product.

See `ACTION` for details on `installhdr` builds.\n\n### INSTALL_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_DIR`\n\nIdentifies the directory in the developer’s filesystem into which the *installed* product is placed.\n\n### Install Group\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_GROUP`\n\nThe group name or `gid` for installed products.\n\n### Install Permissions\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_MODE_FLAG`\n\nPermissions used for installed product files.\n\n### Install Owner\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_OWNER`\n\nThe owner name or `uid` for installed products.\n\n### Installation Directory\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_PATH`\n\nThe directory in which to install the build products. This path is prepended by the `DSTROOT`.\n\n### Intent Class Generation Language\n\n**Setting name:** `INTENTS_CODEGEN_LANGUAGE`\n\nThe Source-code language to use for generated Intent class.  By default “Automatic” will analyze your project to determine the correct language.  Adjust this setting to explicitly select “Swift” or “Objective-C”.\n\n### Building for Mac Catalyst\n\n**Setting name:** `IS_MACCATALYST`\n\nIndicates whether the target is building for Mac Catalyst. This build setting is intended for use in shell scripts and build setting composition and should be considered read-only.\n\n### Preserve Private External Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `KEEP_PRIVATE_EXTERNS`\n\nActivating this setting will preserve private external symbols, rather than turning them into static symbols. This setting is also respected when performing a single-object prelink.\n\n### Launch Constraint Parent Process Plist\n\n**Setting name:** `LAUNCH_CONSTRAINT_PARENT`\n\nA path to a plist representation of a Requirements Dictionary indicating the desired constraint on the parent of this binary.\n\n### Launch Constraint Responsible Process Plist\n\n**Setting name:** `LAUNCH_CONSTRAINT_RESPONSIBLE`\n\nA path to a plist representation of a Requirements Dictionary indicating the desired constraint on the responsible process for this binary.\n\n### Launch Constraint Process Plist\n\n**Setting name:** `LAUNCH_CONSTRAINT_SELF`\n\nA path to a plist representation of a Requirements Dictionary indicating the desired constraint on this binary.\n\n### Client Name\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_CLIENT_NAME`\n\nThis setting passes the value with `-client_name` when linking the executable.\n\n### Path to Linker Dependency Info File\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_DEPENDENCY_INFO_FILE`\n\nThis setting defines the path to which the linker should emit information about what files it used as inputs and generated. Xcode uses this information for its dependency tracking. Setting the value of this setting to empty will disable passing this option to the linker.\n\n### Dynamic Library Allowable Clients\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_DYLIB_ALLOWABLE_CLIENTS`\n\nThis setting restricts the clients allowed to link a dylib by passing `-allowable_client` to the linker for each supplied value.\n\n### Dynamic Library Install Name\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_DYLIB_INSTALL_NAME`\n\nSets an internal `install path` (`LC_ID_DYLIB`) in a dynamic library. Any clients linked against the library will record that path as the way `dyld` should locate this library. If this option is not specified, then the `-o` path will be used. This setting is ignored when building any product other than a dynamic library. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/DynamicLibraries\/000-Introduction\/Introduction.html].\n\n### Dynamic Linker Environment\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_ENVIRONMENT`\n\nThis setting allows `key=value` pairs of `dyld` environment variables to be embedded in a generated executable as `LC_DYLD_ENVIRONMENT` load commands in order to supplement the environment in which the executable is launched, if allowed by the platform and its security environment.\n\n### Export Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_EXPORT_SYMBOLS`\n\nExport symbols from the binaries. Disabling this setting can be useful for binaries which have no API or plug-ins and thus need no symbol exports. [-no_exported_symbols]\n\n### Write Link Map File\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_GENERATE_MAP_FILE`\n\nActivating this setting will cause the linker to write a map file to disk, which details all symbols and their addresses in the output image. The path to the map file is defined by the `LD_MAP_FILE_PATH` setting.\n\n### Path to Link Map File\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_MAP_FILE_PATH`\n\nThis setting defines the path to the map file written by the linker when the `LD_GENERATE_MAP_FILE` setting is activated. By default, a separate file will be written for each architecture and build variant, and these will be generated in the Intermediates directory for the target whose product is being linked.\n\n### Generate Position-Dependent Executable\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_NO_PIE`\n\nActivating this setting will prevent Xcode from building a main executable that is position independent (PIE). When targeting macOS 10.7 or later, PIE is the default for main executables, so activating this setting will change that behavior. When targeting OS X 10.6 or earlier, or when building for i386, PIE is not the default, so activating this setting does nothing.\n\nYou cannot create a PIE from `.o` files compiled with `-mdynamic-no-pic`. Using PIE means the codegen is less optimal, but the address randomization adds some security.\n\n### Quote Linker Arguments\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_QUOTE_LINKER_ARGUMENTS_FOR_COMPILER_DRIVER`\n\nThis setting controls whether arguments to the linker should be quoted using `-Xlinker`. By default, Xcode invokes the linker by invoking the driver of the compiler used to build the source files in the target, and passing `-Xlinker` to quote arguments will cause the compiler driver to pass them through to the linker (rather than trying to evaluate them within the driver). By default, this setting is enabled. Disabling it will cause Xcode to not use `-Xlinker` to pass arguments to the linker. Disabling this setting is useful if the target has instructed Xcode to use an alternate linker (for example, by setting the `LD` setting to the path to another linker) and that alternate linker does not recognize `-Xlinker`.\n\n### Runpath Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to be added to the `runpath` search path list for the image being created. At runtime, `dyld` uses the `runpath` when searching for dylibs whose load path begins with `@rpath\/`. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/DynamicLibraries\/000-Introduction\/Introduction.html].\n\n### Duplicate Libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_WARN_DUPLICATE_LIBRARIES`\n\nWarn for linking the same library multiple times.\n\n### Unused Dylibs\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_WARN_UNUSED_DYLIBS`\n\nWarn for any dylib linked to but not used.\n\n### Other Lex Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `LEXFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to `lex`. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a `lex` flag.\n\n### Generate Case-Insensitive Scanner\n\n**Setting name:** `LEX_CASE_INSENSITIVE_SCANNER`\n\nEnabling this option causes `lex` to generate a case-insensitive scanner. The case of letters given in the `lex` input patterns will be ignored, and tokens in the input will be matched regardless of case. The matched text given in `yytext` will have the preserved case (for example, it will not be folded).\n\n### Insert #line Directives\n\n**Setting name:** `LEX_INSERT_LINE_DIRECTIVES`\n\nEnabling this option instructs `lex` to insert `#line` directives so error messages in the actions will be correctly located with respect to either the original `lex` input file (if the errors are due to code in the input file), or `lex.yy.c` (if the errors are `lex`’s fault). This option is enabled by default; disabling it passes a flag to `lex` to not insert `#line` directives.\n\n### Suppress Default Rule\n\n**Setting name:** `LEX_SUPPRESS_DEFAULT_RULE`\n\nEnabling this option causes the default rule (that unmatched scanner input is echoed to `stdout`) to be suppressed. If the scanner encounters input that does not match any of its rules, it aborts with an error. This option is useful for finding holes in a scanner’s rule set.\n\n### Suppress Warning Messages\n\n**Setting name:** `LEX_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS`\n\nEnabling this option causes `lex` to suppress its warning messages.\n\n### Library Load Constraint Plist\n\n**Setting name:** `LIBRARY_LOAD_CONSTRAINT`\n\nA path to a plist representation of a Requirements Dictionary that specifies the desired set of libraries that can be loaded by this process. Supported when building on macOS 14 or later.\n\n### Library Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to folders to be searched by the linker for libraries used by the product. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted.\n\n### Display Mangled Names\n\n**Setting name:** `LINKER_DISPLAYS_MANGLED_NAMES`\n\nActivating this setting causes the linker to display mangled names for C++ symbols. Normally, this is not recommended, but turning it on can help to diagnose and solve C++ link errors.\n\n### Link With Standard Libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `LINK_WITH_STANDARD_LIBRARIES`\n\nWhen this setting is enabled, the compiler driver will automatically pass its standard libraries to the linker to use during linking. If desired, this flag can be used to disable linking with the standard libraries, and then individual libraries can be passed as `OTHER_LDFLAGS`.\n\n### Link-Time Optimization\n\n**Setting name:** `LLVM_LTO`\n\nEnabling this setting allows optimization across file boundaries during linking.\n\n### Localization Export Supported\n\n**Setting name:** `LOCALIZATION_EXPORT_SUPPORTED`\n\nWhen enabled, localizable content in this target\/project can be exported.\n\n### Localization Prefers String Catalogs\n\n**Setting name:** `LOCALIZATION_PREFERS_STRING_CATALOGS`\n\nWhen enabled, string tables generated in a localization export will prefer the String Catalog format.\n\n### Localized String Macro Names\n\n**Setting name:** `LOCALIZED_STRING_MACRO_NAMES`\n\nThe base names for NSLocalizedString-like macros or functions used to produce localized strings in source code. The default base names of NSLocalizedString and CFCopyLocalizedString are always considered, even if this setting is empty.\n\n### Localized String SwiftUI Support\n\n**Setting name:** `LOCALIZED_STRING_SWIFTUI_SUPPORT`\n\nWhen enabled, literal strings in SwiftUI will be extracted during localization export. This will only extract string literals in `Text()` initializers, unless `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS` is also enabled.\n\n### Mach-O Type\n\n**Setting name:** `MACH_O_TYPE`\n\nThis setting determines the format of the produced binary and how it can be linked when building other binaries. For information on binary types, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/MachOTopics\/1-Articles\/building_files.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40001828-SW1] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/MachOTopics\/0-Introduction\/introduction.html].\n\n### Suppress all mapc warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `MAPC_NO_WARNINGS`\n\nCompile `.xcmappingmodel` files into `.cdm` without reporting warnings.\n\n### Marketing Version\n\n**Setting name:** `MARKETING_VERSION`\n\nThis setting defines the user-visible version of the project.\n\nWhen `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` is enabled, sets the value of the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/bundleresources\/information_property_list\/cfbundleshortversionstring] key in the `Info.plist` file to the value of this build setting.\n\n### Alternative Distribution - Marketplaces\n\n**Setting name:** `MARKETPLACES`\n\nEnable overriding your app’s distributor identifier with a list of additional marketplace identifiers when running from Xcode.\n\n### Build Mergeable Library\n\n**Setting name:** `MERGEABLE_LIBRARY`\n\nFor dynamic libraries and frameworks, links this target’s binary as a mergeable library which can be merged into the product of a target which depends on it if that target is configured to do so. This target will be linked as a mergeable library in release builds so it can be merged, but will instead be linked as a normal dynamic library to be reexported in debug builds. For other binary types, this setting has no effect.\n\nFor more information on mergeable libraries, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/xcode\/configuring-your-project-to-use-mergeable-libraries].\n\n### Create Merged Binary\n\n**Setting name:** `MERGED_BINARY_TYPE`\n\nUse this setting to link the target’s binary by combining it with mergeable libraries it links against to create a single binary. Only applies to executables, dynamic libraries and frameworks.\n\nFor more information on mergeable libraries, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/xcode\/configuring-your-project-to-use-mergeable-libraries].\n\n### Module Map File\n\n**Setting name:** `MODULEMAP_FILE`\n\nThis is the project-relative path to the LLVM module map file that defines the module structure for the compiler. If empty, it will be automatically generated for appropriate products when `DEFINES_MODULE` is enabled.\n\n### Private Module Map File\n\n**Setting name:** `MODULEMAP_PRIVATE_FILE`\n\nThis is the project-relative path to the LLVM module map file that defines the module structure for private headers.\n\n### MODULES_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `MODULES_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the directory that contains the product’s Clang module maps and Swift module content.\n\n### MODULE_CACHE_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `MODULE_CACHE_DIR`\n\nAbsolute path of folder in which compiler stores its cached modules—this cache is a performance improvement.\n\n### Module Identifier\n\n**Setting name:** `MODULE_NAME`\n\nThis is the identifier of the kernel module listed in the generated stub. This is only used when building kernel extensions.\n\n### Module Start Routine\n\n**Setting name:** `MODULE_START`\n\nThis defines the name of the kernel module start routine.

This makes it possible to write a single kernel that is portable and performant across CPUs and GPUs.\n\n### OpenCL Compiler Version\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_COMPILER_VERSION`\n\nThe `OpenCL` C compiler version supported by the platform.\n\n### Flush denorms to zero\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_DENORMS_ARE_ZERO`\n\nThis option controls how single precision and double precision denormalized numbers are handled. If specified as a build option, the single precision denormalized numbers may be flushed to zero; double precision denormalized numbers may also be flushed to zero if the optional extension for double precision is supported. This is intended to be a performance hint and the `OpenCL` compiler can choose not to flush denorms to zero if the device supports single precision (or double precision) denormalized numbers.\n\nThis option is ignored for single precision numbers if the device does not support single precision denormalized numbers, for example, `CL_FP_DENORM` bit is not set in `CL_DEVICE_SINGLE_FP_CONFIG`.\n\nThis option is ignored for double precision numbers if the device does not support double precision or if it does support double precision but not double precision denormalized numbers, for example, `CL_FP_DENORM` bit is not set in `CL_DEVICE_DOUBLE_FP_CONFIG`.\n\nThis flag only applies for scalar and vector single precision floating-point variables and computations on these floating-point variables inside a program.

Order files are text files with one symbol name per line. Lines starting with a `#` are comments. A symbol name may be optionally preceded with its object file leafname and a colon (for example, `foo.o:_foo`). This is useful for static functions\/data that occur in multiple files. A symbol name may also be optionally preceded with the architecture (for example, `ppc:_foo` or `ppc:foo.o:_foo`). This enables you to have one order file that works for multiple architectures. Literal C-strings may be ordered by quoting the string in the order file (for example, `\"Hello, world\\n\"`).\n\nGenerally you should not specify an order file in Debug or Development configurations, as this will make the linked binary less readable to the debugger. Use them only in Release or Deployment configurations.\n\n### Save as Execute-Only\n\n**Setting name:** `OSACOMPILE_EXECUTE_ONLY`\n\nSaves the output script in execute-only form; the script can be run, but cannot be opened in Script Editor or Xcode.

These container directories are known as *bundles*.\n\n### Property List Output Encoding\n\n**Setting name:** `PLIST_FILE_OUTPUT_FORMAT`\n\nSpecifies the output encoding for property list files (`.plist`). The output encodings can be `binary` or `XML`. By default, the output encoding will be unchanged from the input.\n\n### PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the directory that contains the product’s plugins.\n\n### Precompiled Header Uses Files From Build Directory\n\n**Setting name:** `PRECOMPS_INCLUDE_HEADERS_FROM_BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR`\n\nThis setting allows for better control of sharing precompiled prefix header files between projects. By default, Xcode assumes that the prefix header file may include header files from the build directory if the build directory is outside of the project directory. Xcode cannot determine this ahead of time since other projects may not have been built into the shared build directory at the time the information is needed.\n\nIf your prefix file never includes files from the build directory you may set this to `NO` to improve sharing of precompiled headers. If the prefix does use files from a build directory that is inside your project directory, you may set this to `YES` to avoid unintended sharing that may result in build failures.\n\n### Single-Object Prelink Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `PRELINK_FLAGS`\n\nAdditional flags to pass when performing a single-object prelink.\n\n### Prelink libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `PRELINK_LIBS`\n\nAdditional libraries to pass when performing a single-object prelink.\n\n### Private Headers Folder Path\n\n**Setting name:** `PRIVATE_HEADERS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nThe location to copy the private headers to during building, relative to the built products folder.\n\n### PROCESSED_INFOPLIST_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `PROCESSED_INFOPLIST_PATH`\n\nPath of the per-architecture, per-variant intermediate Info.plist after C preprocessing and\/or variable expansion have been applied.\n\n### Product Bundle Identifier\n\n**Setting name:** `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`\n\nA string that uniquely identifies the bundle.

The default language is Roman, which specifies 1-byte character sets.\n\n### Rez Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to search for files with resource manager resources. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted.\n\n### Show Diagnostic Output\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_SHOW_DEBUG_OUTPUT`\n\nEnabling this option causes version and progress information to be written when compiling resource manager resources.\n\n### Suppress Type Redeclaration Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_SUPPRESS_REDECLARED_RESOURCE_TYPE_WARNINGS`\n\nEnabling this option causes warnings about redeclared resource types to be suppressed.\n\n### Allow DYLD Environment Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_ALLOW_DYLD_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app may be affected by dynamic linker environment variables, which you can use to inject code into your app’s process.\n\n### Allow JIT\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_ALLOW_JIT`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app may create writable and executable memory using the MAP_JIT flag.\n\n### Allow Unsigned Executable Memory\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_EXECUTABLE_MEMORY`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app may create writable and executable memory without the restrictions imposed by using the MAP_JIT flag.\n\n### Debugging Tool\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_DEBUGGING_TOOL`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app is a debugger and may attach to other processes or get task ports.\n\n### Disable Executable Page Protection\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_DISABLE_EXECUTABLE_PAGE_PROTECTION`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether to disable all code signing protections while launching an app, and during its execution.\n\n### Disable Library Validation\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_DISABLE_LIBRARY_VALIDATION`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app loads arbitrary plug-ins or frameworks, without requiring code signing.\n\n### Analyze During ‘Build’\n\n**Setting name:** `RUN_CLANG_STATIC_ANALYZER`\n\nActivating this setting will cause Xcode to run the `Clang` static analysis tool on qualifying source files during every build.\n\n### Build Documentation During ‘Build’\n\n**Setting name:** `RUN_DOCUMENTATION_COMPILER`\n\nAlso build documentation as part of the ‘Build’ action.\n\n### Scan All Source Files for Includes\n\n**Setting name:** `SCAN_ALL_SOURCE_FILES_FOR_INCLUDES`\n\nActivating this setting will cause all source files to be scanned for includes (for example, of header files) when computing the dependency graph, in which case if an included file is changed then the including file will be rebuilt next time a target containing it is built. Normally only certain types of files, such as C-language source files, are scanned.\n\nThis setting is useful if your project contains files of unusual types, which are compiled using a custom build rule.\n\n### SCRIPTS_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `SCRIPTS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the directory that contains the product’s scripts.\n\n### Base SDK\n\n**Setting name:** `SDKROOT`\n\nThe name or path of the base SDK being used during the build. The product will be built against the headers and libraries located inside the indicated SDK. This path will be prepended to all search paths, and will be passed through the environment to the compiler and linker. Additional SDKs can be specified in the `ADDITIONAL_SDKS` setting.\n\n### Symbol Ordering Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `SECTORDER_FLAGS`\n\nThese flags are typically used to specify options for ordering symbols within segments, for example the `-sectorder` option to `ld`.\n\nGenerally you should not specify symbol ordering options in Debug or Development configurations, as this will make the linked binary less readable to the debugger. Use them only in Release or Deployment configurations.\n\n### Separately Edit Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `SEPARATE_SYMBOL_EDIT`\n\nActivating this setting when the linked product’s symbols are to be edited will cause editing to occur via a separate invocation of `nmedit(1)`. Otherwise editing will occur during linking, if possible.\n\n### SHARED_FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `SHARED_FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the directory that contains the product’s shared frameworks.\n\n### Precompiled Headers Cache Path\n\n**Setting name:** `SHARED_PRECOMPS_DIR`\n\nThe path where precompiled prefix header files are placed during a build. Defaults to `$(OBJROOT)\/SharedPrecompiledHeaders`.

The order is from highest to lowest precedence. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted. This setting is very similar to “Framework Search Paths”, except that the search paths are passed to the compiler in a way that suppresses most warnings for headers found in system search paths. If the compiler doesn’t support the concept of system framework search paths, then the search paths are appended to any existing framework search paths defined in “Framework Search Paths”.\n\n### System Header Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `SYSTEM_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to folders to be searched by the compiler for included or imported system header files when compiling C, Objective-C, C++, or Objective-C++. The order is from highest to lowest precedence. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted. This setting is very similar to “Header Search Paths”, except that headers are passed to the compiler in a way that suppresses most warnings for headers found in system search paths. If the compiler doesn’t support the concept of system header search paths, then the search paths are appended to any existing header search paths defined in “Header Search Paths”.\n\n### Text-Based InstallAPI Demangle Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_DEMANGLE`\n\nDisplay demangled symbols when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Enable Text-Based InstallAPI for Project Headers\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_ENABLE_PROJECT_HEADERS`\n\nInclude project-level headers when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Exclude Private Header Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_EXCLUDE_PRIVATE_HEADERS`\n\nRemove private-level headers from target when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Exclude Project Header Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_EXCLUDE_PROJECT_HEADERS`\n\nRemove project-level headers from target when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Exclude Public Header Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_EXCLUDE_PUBLIC_HEADERS`\n\nRemove public-level headers from target when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Extra Private Header Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_EXTRA_PRIVATE_HEADERS`\n\nAdd private-level headers from other targets when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Extra Project Header Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_EXTRA_PROJECT_HEADERS`\n\nAdd project-level headers from other targets when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Extra Public Header Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_EXTRA_PUBLIC_HEADERS`\n\nAdd public-level headers from other targets when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Text-Based InstallAPI Language Mode\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_LANGUAGE`\n\nSelects the language mode when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Text-Based InstallAPI Language Dialect\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_LANGUAGE_STANDARD`\n\nSelects the language dialect when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Text-Based InstallAPI Verification Mode\n\n**Setting name:** `TAPI_VERIFY_MODE`\n\nSelects the level of warnings and errors to report when building `Text-Based InstallAPI`.\n\n### Targeted Device Families\n\n**Setting name:** `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY`\n\nComma-separated list of integers corresponding to device families supported by this target.\n\nThe build system uses this information to set the correct value for the `UIDeviceFamily` key it adds to the target’s `Info.plist` file. Values inapplicable to the current platform will be removed automatically. This also drives the `--target-device` flag to actool, which determines the idioms selected during catalog compilation.\n\nPossible values include:\n\n### TARGET_BUILD_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `TARGET_BUILD_DIR`\n\nIdentifies the root of the directory hierarchy that contains the product’s files (no intermediate build files). Run Script build phases that operate on product files of the target that defines them should use the value of this build setting, but Run Script build phases that operate on product files of other targets should use `BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR` instead.\n\n### Target Name\n\n**Setting name:** `TARGET_NAME`\n\nThe name of the current target.\n\n### TARGET_TEMP_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `TARGET_TEMP_DIR`\n\nIdentifies the directory containing the target’s intermediate build files.

Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted. See `ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS` for more details on how this setting is used. If the compiler doesn’t support the concept of user headers, then the search paths are prepended to the any existing header search paths defined in `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`.\n\n### Use Header Maps\n\n**Setting name:** `USE_HEADERMAP`\n\nEnable the use of *Header Maps*, which provide the compiler with a mapping from textual header names to their locations, bypassing the normal compiler header search path mechanisms. This allows source code to include headers from various locations in the file system without needing to update the header search path build settings.\n\n### Validate Built Product\n\n**Setting name:** `VALIDATE_PRODUCT`\n\nIf enabled, perform validation checks on the product as part of the build process.\n\n### VERBOSE_PBXCP\n\n**Setting name:** `VERBOSE_PBXCP`\n\nSpecifies whether the target’s Copy Files build phases generate additional information when copying files.\n\n### Versioning System\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSIONING_SYSTEM`\n\nSelects the process used for version-stamping generated files.\n\n### Versioning Username\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_BUILDER`\n\nThis defines a reference to the user performing a build to be included in the generated Apple Generic Versioning stub. Defaults to the value of the `USER` environment variable.\n\n### Generated Versioning Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_EXPORT_DECL`\n\nThis defines a prefix string for the version info symbol declaration in the generated Apple Generic Versioning stub. This can be used, for example, to add an optional `export` keyword to the version symbol declaration. This should rarely be changed.\n\n### Generated Versioning Source Filename\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_FILE`\n\nUsed to specify a name for the source file that will be generated by Apple Generic Versioning and compiled into your product. By default, this is set to `$(PRODUCT_NAME)_vers.c`.\n\n### Versioning Name Prefix\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_PREFIX`\n\nUsed as a prefix for the name of the version info symbol in the generated versioning source file. If you prefix your exported symbols you will probably want to set this to the same prefix.\n\n### Versioning Name Suffix\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_SUFFIX`\n\nUsed as a suffix for the name of the version info symbol in the generated versioning source file. This is rarely used.\n\n### Other Warning Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `WARNING_CFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional warning flags to pass to the compiler. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a particular compiler warning flag.\n\n### Wrapper Extension\n\n**Setting name:** `WRAPPER_EXTENSION`\n\nThe extension used for product wrappers, which has a default value based on the product type.\n\n### WRAPPER_NAME\n\n**Setting name:** `WRAPPER_NAME`\n\nSpecifies the filename, including the appropriate extension, of the product bundle.\n\n### WRAPPER_SUFFIX\n\n**Setting name:** `WRAPPER_SUFFIX`\n\nSpecifies the suffix of the product bundle name, including the character that separates the extension from the rest of the bundle name.\n\n### Other Yacc Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `YACCFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to `yacc`. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a `yacc` flag.\n\n### Generated File Stem\n\n**Setting name:** `YACC_GENERATED_FILE_STEM`\n\nThe file stem to use for the files generated by `yacc`. The files will be named `<stem>.tab.c` and `<stem>.tab.h` based on the value of this setting. The Standard (`y`) option will cause all `yacc` source files in the same target to produce the same output file, and it is not recommended for targets containing multiple `yacc` source files.\n\n### Generate Debugging Directives\n\n**Setting name:** `YACC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_DIRECTIVES`\n\nEnabling this option changes the preprocessor directives generated by `yacc` so that debugging statements will be incorporated in the compiled code.\n\n### Insert #line Directives\n\n**Setting name:** `YACC_INSERT_LINE_DIRECTIVES`\n\nEnabling this option causes `yacc` to insert the `#line` directives in the generated code. The `#line` directives let the C compiler relate errors in the generated code to the user’s original code. If this option is disabled, `#line` directives specified by the user in the source file will still be retained.",
  "rawMarkdown" : "---\nsource: https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/Xcode\/build-settings-reference\ncrawled: 2025-12-04T02:40:02Z\n---\n\n# Build settings reference\n\n**Article**\n\nA detailed list of individual Xcode build settings that control or change the way a target is built.\n\n## Overview\n\nLook up build settings for your Xcode project.\n\n### Active Build Action\n\n**Setting name:** `ACTION`\n\nA string identifying the build system action being performed.\n\n### Additional SDKs\n\n**Setting name:** `ADDITIONAL_SDKS`\n\nThe locations of any sparse SDKs that should be layered on top of the one specified by `SDKROOT`. If more than one SDK is listed, the first one has highest precedence. Every SDK specified in this setting should be a “sparse” SDK, for example, not an SDK for an entire macOS release.\n\n### Allow Multi-Platform Builds\n\n**Setting name:** `ALLOW_TARGET_PLATFORM_SPECIALIZATION`\n\nIf enabled, allows targets to build multiple times within a single build operation. Targets will build for the platform of the active run destination, as well as the platforms of any targets which depend on them.\n\n### Alternate Install Group\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATE_GROUP`\n\nThe group name or gid for the files listed under the `ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES` setting.\n\n### Alternate Install Permissions\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATE_MODE`\n\nPermissions used for the files listed under the `ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES` setting.\n\n### Alternate Install Owner\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATE_OWNER`\n\nThe owner name or uid for the files listed under the `ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES` setting.\n\n### Alternate Permissions Files\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES`\n\nList of files to which the alternate owner, group and permissions are applied.\n\n### Alternative Distribution - Web\n\n**Setting name:** `ALTERNATIVE_DISTRIBUTION_WEB`\n\nEnable overriding your app’s distributor identifier for web distribution when running from Xcode.\n\n### Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `ALWAYS_EMBED_SWIFT_STANDARD_LIBRARIES`\n\nAlways embed the Swift standard libraries in the target’s products, even if the target does not contain any Swift code.  For example, this should be enabled if the target is embedding other products which contain Swift, or if it is a test target which does not contain Swift but which is testing a product which does.  This setting only applies to wrapped products, not to standalone binary products.\n\n### Always Search User Paths (Deprecated)\n\n**Setting name:** `ALWAYS_SEARCH_USER_PATHS`\n\nThis setting is deprecated as of Xcode 8.3 and may not be supported in future versions. It is recommended that you disable the setting.\n\nIf enabled, both `#include <header.h>`-style and `#include \"header.h\"`-style directives search the paths in `USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` before `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`. As a consequence, user headers, such as your own `String.h` header, have precedence over system headers when using `#include <header.h>`. This is done using the `-iquote` flag for the paths provided in `USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`. If disabled and your compiler fully supports separate user paths, user headers are only accessible with `#include \"header.h\"`-style preprocessor directives.\n\nFor backwards compatibility reasons, this setting is enabled by default. Disabling it is strongly recommended.\n\n### Require Only App-Extension-Safe API\n\n**Setting name:** `APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY`\n\nWhen enabled, this causes the compiler and linker to disallow use of APIs that are not available to app extensions and to disallow linking to frameworks that have not been built with this setting enabled.\n\n### Convert Copied Files\n\n**Setting name:** `APPLY_RULES_IN_COPY_FILES`\n\nEnabling this setting will cause files in the target’s Copy Files build phases to be processed by build rules. For example, property list files (`.plist`) and strings files will be converted as specified by `PLIST_FILE_OUTPUT_FORMAT` and `STRINGS_FILE_OUTPUT_ENCODING`, respectively.\n\n### Process Header Files\n\n**Setting name:** `APPLY_RULES_IN_COPY_HEADERS`\n\nEnabling this setting will cause all Public and Private headers in the target’s Copy Headers build phase to be processed by build rules. This allows custom build rules to be defined to process these headers. Custom script rules can define their outputs relative to `HEADER_OUTPUT_DIR`, which will be provided to that script, taking the header visibility into account. The scripts are also passed `SCRIPT_HEADER_VISIBILITY` (“public” or “private”). Files that should not be processed by build rules may need to be moved to a Copy Files build phase when this setting is enabled.\n\n### Enable App Shortcuts Flexible Matching\n\n**Setting name:** `APP_SHORTCUTS_ENABLE_FLEXIBLE_MATCHING`\n\nWhen enabled, generates assets needed for App Shortcuts Flexible Matching.\n\n### Architectures\n\n**Setting name:** `ARCHS`\n\nA list of the architectures for which the product will be built. This is usually set to a predefined build setting provided by the platform. If more than one architecture is specified, a universal binary will be produced.\n\n### Alternate App Icon Sets\n\n**Setting name:** `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_ALTERNATE_APPICON_NAMES`\n\nA set of additional app icon set names to include as in the built product.

[-ansi] Incompatible GNU extensions include the `asm`, `inline`, and `typeof` keywords (but not the equivalent `__asm__`, `__inline__`, and `__typeof__` forms), and the `\/\/` syntax for comments. This setting also enables trigraphs.\n- *C89:* Accept ISO C90 (1990), but not GNU extensions. [-std=c89]\n- *GNU89:* Accept ISO C90 and GNU extensions. [-std=gnu89]\n- *C99:* Accept ISO C99 (1999), but not GNU extensions. [-std=c99]\n- *GNU99:* Accept ISO C99 and GNU extensions. [-std=gnu99]\n- *C11:* Accept ISO C11 (2011), but not GNU extensions. [-std=c11]\n- *GNU11:* Accept ISO C11 and GNU extensions. [-std=gnu11]\n- *C17:* Accept ISO C17 (2018), but not GNU extensions. [-std=c17]\n- *GNU17:* Accept ISO C17 and GNU extensions. [-std=gnu17]\n- *C23:* Accept ISO C23 (2024), but not GNU extensions. [-std=c23]\n- *GNU23:* Accept ISO C23 and GNU extensions. [-std=gnu23]\n- *Compiler Default:* Tells the compiler to use its default C language dialect. This is normally the best choice unless you have specific needs. (Currently equivalent to GNU99.)\n\n### Generate Position-Dependent Code\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_DYNAMIC_NO_PIC`\n\nFaster function calls for applications. Not appropriate for shared libraries, which need to be position-independent.\n\n### Allow ‘asm’, ‘inline’, ‘typeof’\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_ASM_KEYWORD`\n\nControls whether `asm`, `inline`, and `typeof` are treated as keywords or whether they can be used as identifiers.\n\n### Recognize Builtin Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS`\n\nControls whether builtin functions that do not begin with `__builtin_` as prefix are recognized.\n\nGCC normally generates special code to handle certain builtin functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to `alloca` may become single instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to `memcpy` may become inline copy loops. The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different library. In addition, when a function is recognized as a builtin function, GCC may use information about that function to warn about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function. For example, warnings are given with `-Wformat` for bad calls to `printf`, when `printf` is built in, and `strlen` is known not to modify global memory.\n\n### Enable C++ Exceptions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_CPP_EXCEPTIONS`\n\nEnable C++ exception handling. Generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution. If you do not specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like C++ that normally require exception handling, and disable it for languages like C that do not normally require it. However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in C++.\n\n### Enable C++ Runtime Types\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_CPP_RTTI`\n\nEnable generation of information about every class with virtual functions for use by the C++ runtime type identification features (`dynamic_cast` and `typeid`). If you don’t use those parts of the language, you can save some space by using this flag. Note that exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as needed.\n\n### Enable Exceptions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS`\n\nEnable exception handling. Generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions. For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data size overhead, although it does not affect execution. If you do not specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like C++ and Objective-C that normally require exception handling, and disable it for languages like C that do not normally require it. However, you may need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in other languages. You may also wish to disable this option if you are compiling older programs that don’t use exception handling.\n\n### Generate Floating Point Library Calls\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_FLOATING_POINT_LIBRARY_CALLS`\n\nGenerate output containing library calls for floating point.\n\n### Kernel Development Mode\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_KERNEL_DEVELOPMENT`\n\nActivating this setting enables kernel development mode.\n\n### Enable Objective-C Exceptions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS`\n\nThis setting enables `@try`\/`@catch`\/`@throw` syntax for handling exceptions in Objective-C code. Only applies to Objective-C. [-fobjc-exceptions]\n\n### Recognize Pascal Strings\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_PASCAL_STRINGS`\n\nRecognize and construct Pascal-style string literals. Its use in new code is discouraged.\n\nPascal string literals take the form `\"\\pstring\"` . The special escape sequence `\\p` denotes the Pascal length byte for the string, and will be replaced at compile time with the number of characters that follow. The `\\p` may only appear at the beginning of a string literal, and may not appear in wide string literals or as an integral constant.\n\n### Enable SSE3 Extensions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_SSE3_EXTENSIONS`\n\nSpecifies whether the binary uses the builtin functions that provide access to the SSE3 extensions to the IA-32 architecture.\n\n### Enable SSE4.1 Extensions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_SSE41_EXTENSIONS`\n\nSpecifies whether the binary uses the builtin functions that provide access to the SSE4.1 extensions to the IA-32 architecture.\n\n### Enable SSE4.2 Extensions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_SSE42_EXTENSIONS`\n\nSpecifies whether the binary uses the builtin functions that provide access to the SSE4.2 extensions to the IA-32 architecture.\n\n### Enable Trigraphs\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_ENABLE_TRIGRAPHS`\n\nControls whether or not trigraphs are permitted in the source code.\n\n### Relax IEEE Compliance\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_FAST_MATH`\n\nEnables some floating point optimizations that are not IEEE754-compliant, but which usually work. Programs that require strict IEEE compliance may not work with this option.\n\n### Generate Debug Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS`\n\nEnables or disables generation of debug symbols. When debug symbols are enabled, the level of detail can be controlled by the `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` setting.\n\n### Generate Legacy Test Coverage Files\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES`\n\nActivating this setting causes a `notes` file to be produced that the `gcov` code-coverage utility can use to show program coverage.\n\n### Increase Sharing of Precompiled Headers\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_INCREASE_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_SHARING`\n\nEnabling this option will enable increased sharing of precompiled headers among targets that share the same prefix header and precompiled header directory.\n\nXcode distinguishes between precompiled header (PCH) files by generating a hash value based on the command-line options to the compiler used to create the PCH. Enabling this option will exclude certain compiler options from that hash. Presently this option will exclude search path options (`-I`, `-iquote`, `-isystem`, `-F`, `-L`) from the hash.\n\nEnabling increased sharing of PCH files carries some risk—if two targets use the same prefix header but have different include paths that cause the prefix header to include different files when they are precompiled, then subtle problems may result because one target will use a PCH that was built using files included by the other target. In this case, this option must be turned off in order to enforce correctness.\n\n### Inline Methods Hidden\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_INLINES_ARE_PRIVATE_EXTERN`\n\nWhen enabled, out-of-line copies of inline methods are declared `private extern`.\n\n### Compile Sources As\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_INPUT_FILETYPE`\n\nSpecifies whether to compile each source file according to its file type, or whether to treat all source files in the target as if they are of a specific language.\n\n### Instrument Program Flow\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS`\n\nActivating this setting indicates that code should be added so program flow arcs are instrumented.\n\n### Enable Linking With Shared Libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_LINK_WITH_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES`\n\nEnabling this option allows linking with the shared libraries. This is the default for most product types.\n\n### No Common Blocks\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_NO_COMMON_BLOCKS`\n\nIn C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file, rather than generating them as common blocks. This has the effect that if the same variable is declared (without `extern`) in two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.\n\n### Optimization Level\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`\n\nSpecifies the degree to which the generated code is optimized for speed and binary size.\n\n- *None:* Do not optimize. [-O0] With this setting, the compiler’s goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results. Statements are independent—if you stop the program with a breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.\n- *Fast:* Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more memory for a large function. [-O1] With this setting, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time. In Apple’s compiler, strict aliasing, block reordering, and inter-block scheduling are disabled by default when optimizing.\n- *Faster:* The compiler performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. [-O2] With this setting, the compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining, or register renaming. As compared to the `Fast` setting, this setting increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.\n- *Fastest:* Turns on all optimizations specified by the `Faster` setting and also turns on function inlining and register renaming options. This setting may result in a larger binary. [-O3]\n- *Fastest, Smallest:* Optimize for size. This setting enables all `Faster` optimizations that do not typically increase code size. It also performs further optimizations designed to reduce code size. [-Os]\n- *Fastest, Aggressive Optimizations:* This setting enables `Fastest` but also enables aggressive optimizations that may break strict standards compliance but should work well on well-behaved code. [-Ofast]\n- *Smallest, Aggressive Size Optimizations:* This setting enables additional size savings by isolating repetitive code patterns into a compiler generated function. [-Oz]\n\n### Precompile Prefix Header\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_PRECOMPILE_PREFIX_HEADER`\n\nGenerates a precompiled header for the prefix header, which should reduce overall build times.\n\nPrecompiling the prefix header will be most effective if the contents of the prefix header or any file it includes change rarely. If the contents of the prefix header or any file it includes change frequently, there may be a negative impact to overall build time.\n\n### Prefix Header\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_PREFIX_HEADER`\n\nImplicitly include the named header. The path given should either be a project relative path or an absolute path.\n\n### Preprocessor Macros\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`\n\nSpace-separated list of preprocessor macros of the form `foo` or `foo=bar`.\n\n### Preprocessor Macros Not Used In Precompiled Headers\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS_NOT_USED_IN_PRECOMPS`\n\nSpace-separated list of preprocessor macros of the form `foo` or `foo=bar`. These macros are not used when precompiling a prefix header file.\n\n### Make Strings Read-Only\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_REUSE_STRINGS`\n\nReuse string literals.\n\n### Short Enumeration Constants\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_SHORT_ENUMS`\n\nMake enums only as large as needed for the range of possible values.\n\nThis setting generates code that may not binary compatible with code generated without this setting or with macOS frameworks.\n\n### Enforce Strict Aliasing\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_STRICT_ALIASING`\n\nOptimize code by making more aggressive assumptions about whether pointers can point to the same objects as other pointers. Programs that use pointers a lot may benefit from this, but programs that don’t strictly follow the ISO C rules about the type with which an object may be accessed may behave unexpectedly.\n\n### Symbols Hidden by Default\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN`\n\nWhen enabled, all symbols are declared `private extern` unless explicitly marked to be exported using `__attribute__((visibility(\"default\")))` in code. If not enabled, all symbols are exported unless explicitly marked as `private extern`. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/CppRuntimeEnv\/Articles\/SymbolVisibility.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40001670-CJBGBHEJ] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/CppRuntimeEnv\/CPPRuntimeEnv.html].\n\n### Statics are Thread-Safe\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_THREADSAFE_STATICS`\n\nEmits extra code to use the routines specified in the C++ ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics. You can disable this option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn’t need to be thread-safe.\n\n### Treat Missing Function Prototypes as Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_TREAT_IMPLICIT_FUNCTION_DECLARATIONS_AS_ERRORS`\n\nCauses warnings about missing function prototypes to be treated as errors. Only applies to C and Objective-C.\n\n### Treat Incompatible Pointer Type Warnings as Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_TREAT_INCOMPATIBLE_POINTER_TYPE_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`\n\nEnabling this option causes warnings about incompatible pointer types to be treated as errors.\n\n### Treat Warnings as Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`\n\nEnabling this option causes all warnings to be treated as errors.\n\n### Unroll Loops\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_UNROLL_LOOPS`\n\nUnrolls loops. Unrolling makes the code larger, but may make it faster by reducing the number of branches executed.\n\n### Use Standard System Header Directory Searching\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_USE_STANDARD_INCLUDE_SEARCHING`\n\nControls whether the standard system directories are searched for header files. When disabled, only the directories you have specified with `-I` options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.\n\n### Compiler for C\/C++\/Objective-C\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_VERSION`\n\nThe compiler to use for C, C++, and Objective-C.\n\n### Implicit Conversion to 32 Bit Type\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_64_TO_32_BIT_CONVERSION`\n\nWarn if a value is implicitly converted from a 64-bit type to a 32-bit type. This is a subset of the warnings provided by -Wconversion.\n\n### Deprecated Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_DEPRECATED_FUNCTIONS`\n\nWarn about the use of deprecated functions, variables, and types (as indicated by the `deprecated` attribute).\n\n### Undefined Use of offsetof Macro\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_INVALID_OFFSETOF_MACRO`\n\nUnchecking this setting will suppress warnings from applying the `offsetof` macro to a non-POD type. According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying `offsetof` to a non-POD type is undefined. In existing C++ implementations, however, `offsetof` typically gives meaningful results even when applied to certain kinds of non-POD types, such as a simple struct that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a constructor. This flag is for users who are aware that they are writing non-portable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the warning about it.\n\nThe restrictions on `offsetof` may be relaxed in a future version of the C++ standard.\n\n### Missing Fields in Structure Initializers\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_FIELD_INITIALIZERS`\n\nWarn if a structure’s initializer has some fields missing. For example, the following code would cause such a warning because `x.h` is implicitly zero:\n\n```\nstruct s { int f, g, h; };\nstruct s x = { 3, 4 };\n```\n\nThis option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following modification would not trigger a warning:\n\n```\nstruct s { int f, g, h; };\nstruct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };\n```\n\n### Missing Newline At End Of File\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_NEWLINE`\n\nWarn when a source file does not end with a newline.\n\n### Missing Function Prototypes\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_PROTOTYPES`\n\nCauses warnings to be emitted about missing prototypes.\n\n### Pointer Sign Comparison\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_POINTER_SIGNEDNESS`\n\nWarn when pointers passed via arguments or assigned to a variable differ in sign.\n\n### Mismatched Return Type\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ABOUT_RETURN_TYPE`\n\nCauses warnings to be emitted when a function with a defined return type (not `void`) contains a return statement without a return-value or when it does not contain any return statements. Also emits a warning when a function with a void return type tries to return a value.\n\n### Incomplete Objective-C Protocols\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_ALLOW_INCOMPLETE_PROTOCOL`\n\nWarn if methods required by a protocol are not implemented in the class adopting it. Only applies to Objective-C.\n\n### Check Switch Statements\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_CHECK_SWITCH_STATEMENTS`\n\nWarn whenever a switch statement has an index of enumeral type and lacks a case for one or more of the named codes of that enumeration. The presence of a default label prevents this warning. Case labels outside the enumeration range also provoke warnings when this option is used.\n\n### Four Character Literals\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_FOUR_CHARACTER_CONSTANTS`\n\nWarn about four-char literals (for example, macOS-style `OSTypes`: `'APPL'`).\n\n### Overloaded Virtual Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_HIDDEN_VIRTUAL_FUNCTIONS`\n\nWarn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a base class.\n\nFor example, in the following example, the `A` class version of `f()` is hidden in `B`.\n\n```\nstruct A {\n  virtual void f();\n};\n\nstruct B: public A {\n  void f(int);\n};\n```\n\nAs a result, the following code will fail to compile.\n\n```\nB* b;\nb->f();\n```\n\nThis setting only applies to C++ and Objective-C++ sources.\n\n### Inhibit All Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_INHIBIT_ALL_WARNINGS`\n\nInhibit all warning messages.\n\n### Initializer Not Fully Bracketed\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_INITIALIZER_NOT_FULLY_BRACKETED`\n\nWarn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed. In the following example, the initializer for `a` is not fully bracketed, but the initializer for `b` is fully bracketed.\n\n```\nint a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };\nint b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };\n```\n\n### Missing Braces and Parentheses\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_MISSING_PARENTHESES`\n\nWarn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence causes confusion. Also, warn about constructions where there may be confusion as to which `if` statement an `else` branch belongs. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  if (a)\n    if (b)\n      foo ();\n  else\n    bar ();\n}\n```\n\nIn C, every `else` branch belongs to the innermost possible `if` statement, which in the example above is `if (b)`. This is often not what the programmer expects, as illustrated by indentation used in the example above. This build setting causes GCC to issue a warning when there is the potential for this confusion. To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost `if` statement so there is no way the `else` could belong to the enclosing `if`. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  if (a)\n    {\n      if (b)\n        foo ();\n      else\n        bar ();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Nonvirtual Destructor\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_NON_VIRTUAL_DESTRUCTOR`\n\nWarn when a class declares an nonvirtual destructor that should probably be virtual, because it looks like the class will be used polymorphically. This is only active for C++ or Objective-C++ sources.\n\n### Pedantic Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_PEDANTIC`\n\nIssue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any `-std` option used.\n\n### Hidden Local Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_SHADOW`\n\nWarn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable, parameter or global variable or whenever a builtin function is shadowed.\n\n### Sign Comparison\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_SIGN_COMPARE`\n\nWarn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.\n\n### Strict Selector Matching\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_STRICT_SELECTOR_MATCH`\n\nWarn if multiple methods with differing argument and\/or return types are found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this selector to a receiver of type `id` or `Class`. When this setting is disabled, the compiler will omit such warnings if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size and alignment.\n\n### Typecheck Calls to printf\/scanf\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_TYPECHECK_CALLS_TO_PRINTF`\n\nCheck calls to `printf` and `scanf` to make sure that the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make sense.\n\n### Undeclared Selector\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNDECLARED_SELECTOR`\n\nWarn if a `@selector(...)` expression referring to an undeclared selector is found. A selector is considered undeclared if no method with that name has been declared before the `@selector(...)` expression, either explicitly in an `@interface` or `@protocol` declaration, or implicitly in an `@implementation` section. This option always performs its checks as soon as a `@selector(...)` expression is found, while `-Wselector` only performs its checks in the final stage of compilation. This also enforces the coding style convention that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.\n\n### Uninitialized Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNINITIALIZED_AUTOS`\n\nWarn if a variable might be clobbered by a `setjmp` call or if an automatic variable is used without prior initialization.\n\nThe compiler may not detect all cases where an automatic variable is initialized or all usage patterns that may lead to use prior to initialization. You can toggle between the normal uninitialized value checking or the more aggressive (conservative) checking, which finds more issues but the checking is much stricter.\n\n### Unknown Pragma\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNKNOWN_PRAGMAS`\n\nWarn when a `#pragma` directive is encountered that is not understood by GCC. If this command line option is used, warnings will even be issued for unknown pragmas in system header files. This is not the case if the warnings were only enabled by the `-Wall` command-line option.\n\n### Unused Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_FUNCTION`\n\nWarn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a non-inline static function is unused.\n\n### Unused Labels\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_LABEL`\n\nWarn whenever a label is declared but not used.\n\n### Unused Parameters\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_PARAMETER`\n\nWarn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its declaration.\n\n### Unused Values\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_VALUE`\n\nWarn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.\n\n### Unused Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `GCC_WARN_UNUSED_VARIABLE`\n\nWarn whenever a local variable or nonconstant static variable is unused aside from its declaration.\n\n### Generate Info.plist File\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE`\n\nAutomatically generate an Info.plist file.\n\n### Enable Intermediate Text-Based Stubs Generation\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_INTERMEDIATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS`\n\nEnables the generation of intermediate Text-Based stubs for dynamic libraries and frameworks to more precisely track linker dependencies in incremental builds.\n\n### Force Package Info Generation\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_PKGINFO_FILE`\n\nForces the `PkgInfo` file to be written to wrapped products even if this file is not expected.\n\n### Perform Single-Object Prelink\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_PRELINK_OBJECT_FILE`\n\nActivating this setting will cause the object files built by a target to be prelinked using `ld -r` into a single object file, and that object file will then be linked into the final product. This is useful to force the linker to resolve symbols and link the object files into a single module before building a static library. Also, a separate set of link flags can be applied to the prelink allowing additional control over, for instance, exported symbols.\n\n### Generate Profiling Code\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_PROFILING_CODE`\n\nActivating this setting will cause the compiler and linker to generate profiling code. For example, GCC will generate code suitable for use with `gprof(1)`.\n\n### Enable Text-Based Stubs Generation\n\n**Setting name:** `GENERATE_TEXT_BASED_STUBS`\n\nEnables the generation of Text-Based stubs for dynamic libraries and frameworks.\n\n### HEADERMAP_INCLUDES_FLAT_ENTRIES_FOR_TARGET_BEING_BUILT\n\n**Setting name:** `HEADERMAP_INCLUDES_FLAT_ENTRIES_FOR_TARGET_BEING_BUILT`\n\nSpecifies whether the header map contains a name\/path entry for every header in the target being built.\n\n### HEADERMAP_INCLUDES_FRAMEWORK_ENTRIES_FOR_ALL_PRODUCT_TYPES\n\n**Setting name:** `HEADERMAP_INCLUDES_FRAMEWORK_ENTRIES_FOR_ALL_PRODUCT_TYPES`\n\nSpecifies whether the header map contains a framework-name\/path entry for every header in the target being built, including targets that do not build frameworks.\n\n### HEADERMAP_INCLUDES_PROJECT_HEADERS\n\n**Setting name:** `HEADERMAP_INCLUDES_PROJECT_HEADERS`\n\nSpecifies whether the header map contains a name\/path entry for every header in the project, regardless of the headers’ target membership.\n\n### Header Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to folders to be searched by the compiler for included or imported header files when compiling C, Objective-C, C++, or Objective-C++. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted.\n\n### Auto-Activate Custom Fonts\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_COMPILER_AUTO_ACTIVATE_CUSTOM_FONTS`\n\nInstructs the XIB compiler to add custom fonts to the application’s `Info.plist`, which will cause the fonts to activate upon application launch.\n\n### Show Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_ERRORS`\n\nShow errors encountered during the compilation of XIB files.\n\n### Flatten Compiled XIB Files\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_FLATTEN_NIBS`\n\nIf enabled, compile XIB files into flattened (non-wrapper) NIB files. After flattening, the resulting NIB is more compact but no longer editable by Interface Builder. When this option is disabled, the resulting NIB file remains editable in Interface Builder.\n\n### Default Module\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_MODULE`\n\nDefines the module name for Swift classes referenced without a specific module name.\n\n### Show Notices\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_NOTICES`\n\nShow notices encountered during the compilation of XIB files.\n\n### Other Interface Builder Compiler Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_OTHER_FLAGS`\n\nA list of additional flags to pass to the Interface Builder Compiler. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a particular Interface Builder Compiler flag.\n\n### Overriding Plug-In and Framework Directory\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_OVERRIDING_PLUGINS_AND_FRAMEWORKS_DIR`\n\nInstructs Interface Builder to load frameworks and Interface Builder plugins from the specified directory. Setting this value to `$(BUILD_DIR)\/$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)` will ensure that Interface Builder will load frameworks and plug-ins from the built products directory of the current build configuration.\n\n### Plug-Ins\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_PLUGINS`\n\nA list of paths to Interface Builder plugins to load when compiling XIB files.\n\n### Plug-In Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_PLUGIN_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nA list of paths to be searched for Interface Builder plug-ins to load when compiling XIB files.\n\n### Strip NIB Files\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_STRIP_NIBS`\n\nStrips an Interface Builder NIB to reduce its size for deployment.  The resulting NIB is more compact but no longer editable by Interface Builder.  When this option is disabled, the resulting NIB file remains editable by Interface Builder.\n\n### Show Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `IBC_WARNINGS`\n\nShow warnings encountered during the compilation of XIB files.\n\n### Auto-Activate Custom Fonts\n\n**Setting name:** `IBSC_COMPILER_AUTO_ACTIVATE_CUSTOM_FONTS`\n\nInstructs the Storyboard compiler to add custom fonts to the application’s `Info.plist` that will cause the fonts to activate upon application launch.\n\n### Show Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `IBSC_ERRORS`\n\nShow errors encountered during the compilation of Storyboard files.\n\n### Flatten Compiled Storyboard Files\n\n**Setting name:** `IBSC_FLATTEN_NIBS`\n\nCompiles a Storyboard file into flattened (non-wrapper) Storyboard file.

See `ACTION` for details on `installhdr` builds.\n\n### INSTALL_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_DIR`\n\nIdentifies the directory in the developer’s filesystem into which the *installed* product is placed.\n\n### Install Group\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_GROUP`\n\nThe group name or `gid` for installed products.\n\n### Install Permissions\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_MODE_FLAG`\n\nPermissions used for installed product files.\n\n### Install Owner\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_OWNER`\n\nThe owner name or `uid` for installed products.\n\n### Installation Directory\n\n**Setting name:** `INSTALL_PATH`\n\nThe directory in which to install the build products. This path is prepended by the `DSTROOT`.\n\n### Intent Class Generation Language\n\n**Setting name:** `INTENTS_CODEGEN_LANGUAGE`\n\nThe Source-code language to use for generated Intent class.  By default “Automatic” will analyze your project to determine the correct language.  Adjust this setting to explicitly select “Swift” or “Objective-C”.\n\n### Building for Mac Catalyst\n\n**Setting name:** `IS_MACCATALYST`\n\nIndicates whether the target is building for Mac Catalyst. This build setting is intended for use in shell scripts and build setting composition and should be considered read-only.\n\n### Preserve Private External Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `KEEP_PRIVATE_EXTERNS`\n\nActivating this setting will preserve private external symbols, rather than turning them into static symbols. This setting is also respected when performing a single-object prelink.\n\n### Launch Constraint Parent Process Plist\n\n**Setting name:** `LAUNCH_CONSTRAINT_PARENT`\n\nA path to a plist representation of a Requirements Dictionary indicating the desired constraint on the parent of this binary.\n\n### Launch Constraint Responsible Process Plist\n\n**Setting name:** `LAUNCH_CONSTRAINT_RESPONSIBLE`\n\nA path to a plist representation of a Requirements Dictionary indicating the desired constraint on the responsible process for this binary.\n\n### Launch Constraint Process Plist\n\n**Setting name:** `LAUNCH_CONSTRAINT_SELF`\n\nA path to a plist representation of a Requirements Dictionary indicating the desired constraint on this binary.\n\n### Client Name\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_CLIENT_NAME`\n\nThis setting passes the value with `-client_name` when linking the executable.\n\n### Path to Linker Dependency Info File\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_DEPENDENCY_INFO_FILE`\n\nThis setting defines the path to which the linker should emit information about what files it used as inputs and generated. Xcode uses this information for its dependency tracking. Setting the value of this setting to empty will disable passing this option to the linker.\n\n### Dynamic Library Allowable Clients\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_DYLIB_ALLOWABLE_CLIENTS`\n\nThis setting restricts the clients allowed to link a dylib by passing `-allowable_client` to the linker for each supplied value.\n\n### Dynamic Library Install Name\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_DYLIB_INSTALL_NAME`\n\nSets an internal `install path` (`LC_ID_DYLIB`) in a dynamic library. Any clients linked against the library will record that path as the way `dyld` should locate this library. If this option is not specified, then the `-o` path will be used. This setting is ignored when building any product other than a dynamic library. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/DynamicLibraries\/000-Introduction\/Introduction.html].\n\n### Dynamic Linker Environment\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_ENVIRONMENT`\n\nThis setting allows `key=value` pairs of `dyld` environment variables to be embedded in a generated executable as `LC_DYLD_ENVIRONMENT` load commands in order to supplement the environment in which the executable is launched, if allowed by the platform and its security environment.\n\n### Export Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_EXPORT_SYMBOLS`\n\nExport symbols from the binaries. Disabling this setting can be useful for binaries which have no API or plug-ins and thus need no symbol exports. [-no_exported_symbols]\n\n### Write Link Map File\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_GENERATE_MAP_FILE`\n\nActivating this setting will cause the linker to write a map file to disk, which details all symbols and their addresses in the output image. The path to the map file is defined by the `LD_MAP_FILE_PATH` setting.\n\n### Path to Link Map File\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_MAP_FILE_PATH`\n\nThis setting defines the path to the map file written by the linker when the `LD_GENERATE_MAP_FILE` setting is activated. By default, a separate file will be written for each architecture and build variant, and these will be generated in the Intermediates directory for the target whose product is being linked.\n\n### Generate Position-Dependent Executable\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_NO_PIE`\n\nActivating this setting will prevent Xcode from building a main executable that is position independent (PIE). When targeting macOS 10.7 or later, PIE is the default for main executables, so activating this setting will change that behavior. When targeting OS X 10.6 or earlier, or when building for i386, PIE is not the default, so activating this setting does nothing.\n\nYou cannot create a PIE from `.o` files compiled with `-mdynamic-no-pic`. Using PIE means the codegen is less optimal, but the address randomization adds some security.\n\n### Quote Linker Arguments\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_QUOTE_LINKER_ARGUMENTS_FOR_COMPILER_DRIVER`\n\nThis setting controls whether arguments to the linker should be quoted using `-Xlinker`. By default, Xcode invokes the linker by invoking the driver of the compiler used to build the source files in the target, and passing `-Xlinker` to quote arguments will cause the compiler driver to pass them through to the linker (rather than trying to evaluate them within the driver). By default, this setting is enabled. Disabling it will cause Xcode to not use `-Xlinker` to pass arguments to the linker. Disabling this setting is useful if the target has instructed Xcode to use an alternate linker (for example, by setting the `LD` setting to the path to another linker) and that alternate linker does not recognize `-Xlinker`.\n\n### Runpath Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to be added to the `runpath` search path list for the image being created. At runtime, `dyld` uses the `runpath` when searching for dylibs whose load path begins with `@rpath\/`. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/DynamicLibraries\/000-Introduction\/Introduction.html].\n\n### Duplicate Libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_WARN_DUPLICATE_LIBRARIES`\n\nWarn for linking the same library multiple times.\n\n### Unused Dylibs\n\n**Setting name:** `LD_WARN_UNUSED_DYLIBS`\n\nWarn for any dylib linked to but not used.\n\n### Other Lex Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `LEXFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to `lex`. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a `lex` flag.\n\n### Generate Case-Insensitive Scanner\n\n**Setting name:** `LEX_CASE_INSENSITIVE_SCANNER`\n\nEnabling this option causes `lex` to generate a case-insensitive scanner. The case of letters given in the `lex` input patterns will be ignored, and tokens in the input will be matched regardless of case. The matched text given in `yytext` will have the preserved case (for example, it will not be folded).\n\n### Insert #line Directives\n\n**Setting name:** `LEX_INSERT_LINE_DIRECTIVES`\n\nEnabling this option instructs `lex` to insert `#line` directives so error messages in the actions will be correctly located with respect to either the original `lex` input file (if the errors are due to code in the input file), or `lex.yy.c` (if the errors are `lex`’s fault). This option is enabled by default; disabling it passes a flag to `lex` to not insert `#line` directives.\n\n### Suppress Default Rule\n\n**Setting name:** `LEX_SUPPRESS_DEFAULT_RULE`\n\nEnabling this option causes the default rule (that unmatched scanner input is echoed to `stdout`) to be suppressed. If the scanner encounters input that does not match any of its rules, it aborts with an error. This option is useful for finding holes in a scanner’s rule set.\n\n### Suppress Warning Messages\n\n**Setting name:** `LEX_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS`\n\nEnabling this option causes `lex` to suppress its warning messages.\n\n### Library Load Constraint Plist\n\n**Setting name:** `LIBRARY_LOAD_CONSTRAINT`\n\nA path to a plist representation of a Requirements Dictionary that specifies the desired set of libraries that can be loaded by this process. Supported when building on macOS 14 or later.\n\n### Library Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to folders to be searched by the linker for libraries used by the product. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted.\n\n### Display Mangled Names\n\n**Setting name:** `LINKER_DISPLAYS_MANGLED_NAMES`\n\nActivating this setting causes the linker to display mangled names for C++ symbols. Normally, this is not recommended, but turning it on can help to diagnose and solve C++ link errors.\n\n### Link With Standard Libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `LINK_WITH_STANDARD_LIBRARIES`\n\nWhen this setting is enabled, the compiler driver will automatically pass its standard libraries to the linker to use during linking. If desired, this flag can be used to disable linking with the standard libraries, and then individual libraries can be passed as `OTHER_LDFLAGS`.\n\n### Link-Time Optimization\n\n**Setting name:** `LLVM_LTO`\n\nEnabling this setting allows optimization across file boundaries during linking.\n\n- *No:* Disabled. Do not use link-time optimization.\n- *Monolithic Link-Time Optimization:* This mode performs monolithic link-time optimization of binaries, combining all executable code into a single unit and running aggressive compiler optimizations.\n- *Incremental Link-Time Optimization:* This mode performs partitioned link-time optimization of binaries, inlining between compilation units and running aggressive compiler optimizations on each unit in parallel. This enables fast incremental builds and uses less memory than Monolithic LTO.\n\n### Localization Export Supported\n\n**Setting name:** `LOCALIZATION_EXPORT_SUPPORTED`\n\nWhen enabled, localizable content in this target\/project can be exported.\n\n### Localization Prefers String Catalogs\n\n**Setting name:** `LOCALIZATION_PREFERS_STRING_CATALOGS`\n\nWhen enabled, string tables generated in a localization export will prefer the String Catalog format.\n\n### Localized String Macro Names\n\n**Setting name:** `LOCALIZED_STRING_MACRO_NAMES`\n\nThe base names for NSLocalizedString-like macros or functions used to produce localized strings in source code. The default base names of NSLocalizedString and CFCopyLocalizedString are always considered, even if this setting is empty.\n\n### Localized String SwiftUI Support\n\n**Setting name:** `LOCALIZED_STRING_SWIFTUI_SUPPORT`\n\nWhen enabled, literal strings in SwiftUI will be extracted during localization export. This will only extract string literals in `Text()` initializers, unless `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS` is also enabled.\n\n### Mach-O Type\n\n**Setting name:** `MACH_O_TYPE`\n\nThis setting determines the format of the produced binary and how it can be linked when building other binaries. For information on binary types, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/MachOTopics\/1-Articles\/building_files.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40001828-SW1] in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/MachOTopics\/0-Introduction\/introduction.html].\n\n- *Executable:* Executables and standalone binaries and cannot be linked.

[mh_object]\n\n### Suppress all mapc warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `MAPC_NO_WARNINGS`\n\nCompile `.xcmappingmodel` files into `.cdm` without reporting warnings.\n\n### Marketing Version\n\n**Setting name:** `MARKETING_VERSION`\n\nThis setting defines the user-visible version of the project.\n\nWhen `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` is enabled, sets the value of the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/bundleresources\/information_property_list\/cfbundleshortversionstring] key in the `Info.plist` file to the value of this build setting.\n\n### Alternative Distribution - Marketplaces\n\n**Setting name:** `MARKETPLACES`\n\nEnable overriding your app’s distributor identifier with a list of additional marketplace identifiers when running from Xcode.\n\n### Build Mergeable Library\n\n**Setting name:** `MERGEABLE_LIBRARY`\n\nFor dynamic libraries and frameworks, links this target’s binary as a mergeable library which can be merged into the product of a target which depends on it if that target is configured to do so. This target will be linked as a mergeable library in release builds so it can be merged, but will instead be linked as a normal dynamic library to be reexported in debug builds. For other binary types, this setting has no effect.\n\nFor more information on mergeable libraries, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/xcode\/configuring-your-project-to-use-mergeable-libraries].\n\n### Create Merged Binary\n\n**Setting name:** `MERGED_BINARY_TYPE`\n\nUse this setting to link the target’s binary by combining it with mergeable libraries it links against to create a single binary. Only applies to executables, dynamic libraries and frameworks.\n\n- When set to Automatic, this target’s immediate dependencies which build dynamic libraries or frameworks and are in its Link Binaries With Libraries will automatically be built as mergeable libraries and merged into this target’s binary during release builds, or reexported during debug builds.\n- When set to Manual, only immediate dependencies which have Build Mergeable Library explicitly enabled will be merged or reexported.\n\nFor more information on mergeable libraries, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/xcode\/configuring-your-project-to-use-mergeable-libraries].\n\n### Module Map File\n\n**Setting name:** `MODULEMAP_FILE`\n\nThis is the project-relative path to the LLVM module map file that defines the module structure for the compiler.

Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted. [MTL_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS, -I]\n\n### Ignore Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `MTL_IGNORE_WARNINGS`\n\nEnabling this option causes all warnings to be ignored.  [MTL_IGNORE_WARNINGS, -W]\n\n### Metal Language Revision\n\n**Setting name:** `MTL_LANGUAGE_REVISION`\n\nDetermine the language revision to use. A value for this option must be provided.\n\n### Single-Precision Floating Point Functions\n\n**Setting name:** `MTL_MATH_FP32_FUNCTIONS`\n\nControls default math functions for single precision floating-point\n\n### Math Mode\n\n**Setting name:** `MTL_MATH_MODE`\n\nControls floating-point optimizations\n\n### Optimization Level\n\n**Setting name:** `MTL_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`\n\nOptimization level for the Metal compiler.\n\n- *Default:* Optimize for program performance [-O2]. This setting applies a moderate level of optimization that enables most optimizations.\n- *Size:* Like default, with extra optimizations to reduce code size [-Os]. This setting limits optimizations that increase code size, such as loop unrolling and function inlining, and enables other optimizations for size. It may reduce compile time and compiler memory in cases where optimizing for performance results in very large code.\n\n### Preprocessor Definitions\n\n**Setting name:** `MTL_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`\n\nSpace-separated list of preprocessor macros of the form “foo” or “foo=bar”.\n\n### Treat Warnings as Errors\n\n**Setting name:** `MTL_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`\n\nEnabling this option causes all warnings to be treated as errors.  [MTL_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS, -Werror]\n\n### NATIVE_ARCH\n\n**Setting name:** `NATIVE_ARCH`\n\nIdentifies the architecture on which the build is being performed.\n\n### OBJECT_FILE_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `OBJECT_FILE_DIR`\n\nPartially identifies the directory into which variant object files are placed. The complete specification is computed using the variants of this build setting.\n\n### Intermediate Build Files Path\n\n**Setting name:** `OBJROOT`\n\nThe path where intermediate files will be placed during a build. Intermediate files include generated sources, object files, etc. Shell script build phases can place and access files here, as well. Typically this path is not set per target, but is set per project or per user. By default, this is set to `$(PROJECT_DIR)\/build`.\n\n### Build Active Architecture Only\n\n**Setting name:** `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH`\n\nIf enabled, only the active architecture is built. This setting will be ignored when building with a run destination which does not define a specific architecture, such as a ‘Generic Device’ run destination, or if the ‘Override Architectures’ scheme option is set to ‘Match Run Destination’ or ‘Universal’.\n\n### On Demand Resources Initial Install Tags\n\n**Setting name:** `ON_DEMAND_RESOURCES_INITIAL_INSTALL_TAGS`\n\nDefined a set of initial On Demand Resources tags to be downloaded and installed with your application.\n\n### On Demand Resources Prefetch Order\n\n**Setting name:** `ON_DEMAND_RESOURCES_PREFETCH_ORDER`\n\nOnce your app is installed, this defined a set of On Demand Resources tags that should be downloaded. These tags are downloaded after the initial installation of your application, and will be downloaded in the order the tags provided in the list from first to last.\n\n### OpenCL Architectures\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_ARCHS`\n\nA list of the architectures for which the product will be built. This is usually set to a predefined build setting provided by the platform.\n\n### Auto-vectorizer\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_AUTO_VECTORIZE_ENABLE`\n\nAuto-vectorizes the `OpenCL` kernels for the CPU.

If specified as a build option, the single precision denormalized numbers may be flushed to zero; double precision denormalized numbers may also be flushed to zero if the optional extension for double precision is supported. This is intended to be a performance hint and the `OpenCL` compiler can choose not to flush denorms to zero if the device supports single precision (or double precision) denormalized numbers.\n\nThis option is ignored for single precision numbers if the device does not support single precision denormalized numbers, for example, `CL_FP_DENORM` bit is not set in `CL_DEVICE_SINGLE_FP_CONFIG`.\n\nThis option is ignored for double precision numbers if the device does not support double precision or if it does support double precision but not double precision denormalized numbers, for example, `CL_FP_DENORM` bit is not set in `CL_DEVICE_DOUBLE_FP_CONFIG`.\n\nThis flag only applies for scalar and vector single precision floating-point variables and computations on these floating-point variables inside a program. It does not apply to reading from or writing to image objects.\n\n### Double as single\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_DOUBLE_AS_SINGLE`\n\nTreat double precision floating-point expression as a single precision floating-point expression. This option is available for GPUs only.\n\n### Relax IEEE Compliance\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_FAST_RELAXED_MATH`\n\nThis allows optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that may violate the IEEE 754 standard and the `OpenCL` numerical compliance requirements defined in in section 7.4 for single-precision floating-point, section 9.3.9 for double-precision floating-point, and edge case behavior in section 7.5 of the `OpenCL` 1.1 specification.\n\nThis is intended to be a performance optimization.\n\nThis option causes the preprocessor macro `__FAST_RELAXED_MATH__` to be defined in the `OpenCL` program.\n\n### Use MAD\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_MAD_ENABLE`\n\nAllow `a * b + c` to be replaced by a `mad` instruction. The `mad` computes `a * b + c` with reduced accuracy. For example, some `OpenCL` devices implement `mad` as truncate the result of `a * b` before adding it to `c`.\n\nThis is intended to be a performance optimization.\n\n### Optimization Level\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`\n\n- *None:* Do not optimize. [-O0] With this setting, the compiler’s goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results. Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.\n- *Fast:* Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more memory for a large function. [-O, -O1] With this setting, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time. In Apple’s compiler, strict aliasing, block reordering, and inter-block scheduling are disabled by default when optimizing.\n- *Faster:* The compiler performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. [-O2] With this setting, the compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining, or register renaming. As compared to the `Fast` setting, this setting increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.\n- *Fastest:* Turns on all optimizations specified by the `Faster` setting and also turns on function inlining and register renaming options. This setting may result in a larger binary. [-O3]\n- *Fastest, smallest:* Optimize for size. This setting enables all `Faster` optimizations that do not typically increase code size. It also performs further optimizations designed to reduce code size. [-Os]\n\n### OpenCL Other Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_OTHER_BC_FLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to the compiler. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a particular compiler flag.\n\n### OpenCL Preprocessor Macros\n\n**Setting name:** `OPENCL_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`\n\nSpace-separated list of preprocessor macros of the form `foo` or `foo=bar`.\n\n### Order File\n\n**Setting name:** `ORDER_FILE`\n\nThe path to a file that alters the order in which functions and data are laid out.\n\nFor each section in the output file, any symbol in that section that are specified in the order file is moved to the start of its section and laid out in the same order as in the order file. Order files are text files with one symbol name per line. Lines starting with a `#` are comments. A symbol name may be optionally preceded with its object file leafname and a colon (for example, `foo.o:_foo`). This is useful for static functions\/data that occur in multiple files. A symbol name may also be optionally preceded with the architecture (for example, `ppc:_foo` or `ppc:foo.o:_foo`). This enables you to have one order file that works for multiple architectures. Literal C-strings may be ordered by quoting the string in the order file (for example, `\"Hello, world\\n\"`).\n\nGenerally you should not specify an order file in Debug or Development configurations, as this will make the linked binary less readable to the debugger. Use them only in Release or Deployment configurations.\n\n### Save as Execute-Only\n\n**Setting name:** `OSACOMPILE_EXECUTE_ONLY`\n\nSaves the output script in execute-only form; the script can be run, but cannot be opened in Script Editor or Xcode. With this option turned off, a user may see the original script source by opening the script.\n\n### Other C Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OTHER_CFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to the compiler for C and Objective-C files. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces.

Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a particular `iig` flag\n\n### Other IIG Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OTHER_IIG_FLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to the `iig` compiler. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a particular `iig` flag\n\n### Other Linker Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OTHER_LDFLAGS`\n\nOptions defined in this setting are passed to invocations of the linker.\n\n### Other Librarian Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OTHER_LIBTOOLFLAGS`\n\nOptions defined in this setting are passed to all invocations of the archive librarian, which is used to generate static libraries.\n\n### Other MiG Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OTHER_MIGFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to `mig`. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a `mig` flag.\n\n### Other Module Verifier Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OTHER_MODULE_VERIFIER_FLAGS`\n\nAdditional flags to pass to the modules-verifier tool.\n\n### Other OSACompile Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OTHER_OSACOMPILEFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to `osacompile`. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces. Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a particular `osacompile` flag.\n\n### Other Rez Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `OTHER_REZFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional flags to pass to the `Rez` compiler. Be sure to backslash-escape any arguments that contain spaces or special characters, such as path names that may contain spaces.

Identifies the type of the product the target builds. Some products may be made up of a single binary or archive. Others may comprise several files, which are grouped under a single directory. These container directories are known as *bundles*.\n\n### Property List Output Encoding\n\n**Setting name:** `PLIST_FILE_OUTPUT_FORMAT`\n\nSpecifies the output encoding for property list files (`.plist`). The output encodings can be `binary` or `XML`. By default, the output encoding will be unchanged from the input.\n\n### PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the directory that contains the product’s plugins.\n\n### Precompiled Header Uses Files From Build Directory\n\n**Setting name:** `PRECOMPS_INCLUDE_HEADERS_FROM_BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR`\n\nThis setting allows for better control of sharing precompiled prefix header files between projects. By default, Xcode assumes that the prefix header file may include header files from the build directory if the build directory is outside of the project directory. Xcode cannot determine this ahead of time since other projects may not have been built into the shared build directory at the time the information is needed.\n\nIf your prefix file never includes files from the build directory you may set this to `NO` to improve sharing of precompiled headers. If the prefix does use files from a build directory that is inside your project directory, you may set this to `YES` to avoid unintended sharing that may result in build failures.\n\n### Single-Object Prelink Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `PRELINK_FLAGS`\n\nAdditional flags to pass when performing a single-object prelink.\n\n### Prelink libraries\n\n**Setting name:** `PRELINK_LIBS`\n\nAdditional libraries to pass when performing a single-object prelink.\n\n### Private Headers Folder Path\n\n**Setting name:** `PRIVATE_HEADERS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nThe location to copy the private headers to during building, relative to the built products folder.\n\n### PROCESSED_INFOPLIST_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `PROCESSED_INFOPLIST_PATH`\n\nPath of the per-architecture, per-variant intermediate Info.plist after C preprocessing and\/or variable expansion have been applied.\n\n### Product Bundle Identifier\n\n**Setting name:** `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`\n\nA string that uniquely identifies the bundle. The string should be in reverse DNS format using only alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`), the dot (`.`), and the hyphen (`-`).\n\nWhen `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` is enabled, sets the value of the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/bundleresources\/information_property_list\/cfbundleidentifier] key in the `Info.plist` file to the value of this build setting.\n\n### PRODUCT_DEFINITION_PLIST\n\n**Setting name:** `PRODUCT_DEFINITION_PLIST`\n\nPath to a file specifying additional requirements for a product archive.\n\n### Product Module Name\n\n**Setting name:** `PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME`\n\nThe name to use for the source code module constructed for this target, and which will be used to import the module in implementation source files. Must be a valid identifier.\n\n### Product Name\n\n**Setting name:** `PRODUCT_NAME`\n\nThis is the basename of the product generated by the target.\n\nWhen `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE` is enabled, sets the value of the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/bundleresources\/information_property_list\/cfbundlename] key in the `Info.plist` file to the value of this build setting.\n\n### Project Name\n\n**Setting name:** `PROJECT_NAME`\n\nThe name of the current project.\n\n### PROJECT_TEMP_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `PROJECT_TEMP_DIR`\n\nIdentifies the directory in which the project’s intermediate build files are placed. This directory is shared between all the targets defined by the project. Run Script build phases should generate intermediate build files in the directory identified by `DERIVED_FILE_DIR`, not the location this build setting specifies.\n\n### Provisioning Profile\n\n**Setting name:** `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`\n\nMust contain a profile name (or UUID). A missing or invalid profile will cause a build error. Use in conjunction with [DEVELOPMENT_TEAM] to fully specify provisioning profile.\n\n### Public Headers Folder Path\n\n**Setting name:** `PUBLIC_HEADERS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nThe location to copy the public headers to during building, relative to the built products folder.\n\n### Re-Exported Framework Names\n\n**Setting name:** `REEXPORTED_FRAMEWORK_NAMES`\n\nList of framework names that should have their symbols be reexported from the built library.\n\n### Re-Exported Library Names\n\n**Setting name:** `REEXPORTED_LIBRARY_NAMES`\n\nList of library names that should have their symbols be reexported from the built library.\n\n### Re-Exported Library Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `REEXPORTED_LIBRARY_PATHS`\n\nList of library paths that should have their symbols be reexported from the built library.\n\n### Strip USDZ file(s) from Reference Object\n\n**Setting name:** `REFERENCEOBJECT_STRIP_USDZ`\n\nStrip any embedded USDZ files when compiling a Reference Object file.\n\n### Register App Groups\n\n**Setting name:** `REGISTER_APP_GROUPS`\n\nRegister app groups in profiles.\n\n### REMOVE_CVS_FROM_RESOURCES\n\n**Setting name:** `REMOVE_CVS_FROM_RESOURCES`\n\nSpecifies whether to remove `CVS` directories from bundle resources when they are copied.\n\n### REMOVE_GIT_FROM_RESOURCES\n\n**Setting name:** `REMOVE_GIT_FROM_RESOURCES`\n\nSpecifies whether to remove `.git` directories from bundle resources when they are copied.\n\n### REMOVE_HG_FROM_RESOURCES\n\n**Setting name:** `REMOVE_HG_FROM_RESOURCES`\n\nSpecifies whether to remove `.hg` directories from bundle resources when they are copied.\n\n### REMOVE_SVN_FROM_RESOURCES\n\n**Setting name:** `REMOVE_SVN_FROM_RESOURCES`\n\nSpecifies whether to remove `SVN` directories from bundle resources when they are copied.\n\n### File Fork of Binary Sources\n\n**Setting name:** `RESMERGER_SOURCES_FORK`\n\nDetermines whether `ResMerger` treats binary input files as data-fork hosted or resource-fork hosted, or whether it automatically examines each input file.\n\n### Resources Targeted Device Family\n\n**Setting name:** `RESOURCES_TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY`\n\nOverrides `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` when the resource copying needs to differ from the default targeted device.\n\n### RETAIN_RAW_BINARIES\n\n**Setting name:** `RETAIN_RAW_BINARIES`\n\nSpecifies whether to keep copies of unstripped binaries available.\n\n### REZ_COLLECTOR_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_COLLECTOR_DIR`\n\nSpecifies the directory in which the collected Resource Manager resources generated by `ResMerger` are stored before they are added to the product.\n\n### REZ_OBJECTS_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_OBJECTS_DIR`\n\nSpecifies the directory in which compiled Resource Manager resources generated by `Rez` are stored before they are collected using `ResMerger`.\n\n### Rez Prefix File\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_PREFIX_FILE`\n\nImplicitly include the named file on the command line for each `Rez` file compiled. The path given should either be a project relative path or an absolute path.\n\n### Preprocessor Defines\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS`\n\nThese strings will be defined when compiling resource manager resources.\n\n### Preprocessor Undefines\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_PREPROCESSOR_UNDEFINITIONS`\n\nThese strings will be undefined when compiling resource manager resources.\n\n### Resolve Aliases\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_RESOLVE_ALIASES`\n\nEnables aliases to be unresolved or conditionally resolved. The default is to resolve aliases always.\n\n### Read-only Resource Map\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_RESOURCE_MAP_READ_ONLY`\n\nEnabling this option causes the resource map output to be read-only.\n\n### Rez Script Type\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_SCRIPT_TYPE`\n\nEnables the recognition of a specific 2-byte character script identifier to use when compiling resource manager resources. This allows for 2-byte characters in strings to be handled as indivisible entities. The default language is Roman, which specifies 1-byte character sets.\n\n### Rez Search Paths\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_SEARCH_PATHS`\n\nThis is a list of paths to search for files with resource manager resources. Paths are delimited by whitespace, so any paths with spaces in them need to be properly quoted.\n\n### Show Diagnostic Output\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_SHOW_DEBUG_OUTPUT`\n\nEnabling this option causes version and progress information to be written when compiling resource manager resources.\n\n### Suppress Type Redeclaration Warnings\n\n**Setting name:** `REZ_SUPPRESS_REDECLARED_RESOURCE_TYPE_WARNINGS`\n\nEnabling this option causes warnings about redeclared resource types to be suppressed.\n\n### Allow DYLD Environment Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_ALLOW_DYLD_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app may be affected by dynamic linker environment variables, which you can use to inject code into your app’s process.\n\n### Allow JIT\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_ALLOW_JIT`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app may create writable and executable memory using the MAP_JIT flag.\n\n### Allow Unsigned Executable Memory\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_EXECUTABLE_MEMORY`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app may create writable and executable memory without the restrictions imposed by using the MAP_JIT flag.\n\n### Debugging Tool\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_DEBUGGING_TOOL`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app is a debugger and may attach to other processes or get task ports.\n\n### Disable Executable Page Protection\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_DISABLE_EXECUTABLE_PAGE_PROTECTION`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether to disable all code signing protections while launching an app, and during its execution.\n\n### Disable Library Validation\n\n**Setting name:** `RUNTIME_EXCEPTION_DISABLE_LIBRARY_VALIDATION`\n\nA Boolean value that indicates whether the app loads arbitrary plug-ins or frameworks, without requiring code signing.\n\n### Analyze During ‘Build’\n\n**Setting name:** `RUN_CLANG_STATIC_ANALYZER`\n\nActivating this setting will cause Xcode to run the `Clang` static analysis tool on qualifying source files during every build.\n\n### Build Documentation During ‘Build’\n\n**Setting name:** `RUN_DOCUMENTATION_COMPILER`\n\nAlso build documentation as part of the ‘Build’ action.\n\n### Scan All Source Files for Includes\n\n**Setting name:** `SCAN_ALL_SOURCE_FILES_FOR_INCLUDES`\n\nActivating this setting will cause all source files to be scanned for includes (for example, of header files) when computing the dependency graph, in which case if an included file is changed then the including file will be rebuilt next time a target containing it is built. Normally only certain types of files, such as C-language source files, are scanned.\n\nThis setting is useful if your project contains files of unusual types, which are compiled using a custom build rule.\n\n### SCRIPTS_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `SCRIPTS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the directory that contains the product’s scripts.\n\n### Base SDK\n\n**Setting name:** `SDKROOT`\n\nThe name or path of the base SDK being used during the build. The product will be built against the headers and libraries located inside the indicated SDK. This path will be prepended to all search paths, and will be passed through the environment to the compiler and linker. Additional SDKs can be specified in the `ADDITIONAL_SDKS` setting.\n\n### Symbol Ordering Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `SECTORDER_FLAGS`\n\nThese flags are typically used to specify options for ordering symbols within segments, for example the `-sectorder` option to `ld`.\n\nGenerally you should not specify symbol ordering options in Debug or Development configurations, as this will make the linked binary less readable to the debugger. Use them only in Release or Deployment configurations.\n\n### Separately Edit Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `SEPARATE_SYMBOL_EDIT`\n\nActivating this setting when the linked product’s symbols are to be edited will cause editing to occur via a separate invocation of `nmedit(1)`. Otherwise editing will occur during linking, if possible.\n\n### SHARED_FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH\n\n**Setting name:** `SHARED_FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH`\n\nSpecifies the directory that contains the product’s shared frameworks.\n\n### Precompiled Headers Cache Path\n\n**Setting name:** `SHARED_PRECOMPS_DIR`\n\nThe path where precompiled prefix header files are placed during a build. Defaults to `$(OBJROOT)\/SharedPrecompiledHeaders`. Using a common location allows precompiled headers to be shared between multiple projects.\n\n### Skip Install\n\n**Setting name:** `SKIP_INSTALL`\n\nIf enabled, don’t install built products even if deployment locations are active.\n\n### SRCROOT\n\n**Setting name:** `SRCROOT`\n\nIdentifies the directory containing the target’s source files.\n\n### STRINGSDATA_DIR\n\n**Setting name:** `STRINGSDATA_DIR`\n\nThe location to write .stringsdata files to when SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS is enabled.\n\n### STRINGSDATA_ROOT\n\n**Setting name:** `STRINGSDATA_ROOT`\n\nThe location to traverse and collect .stringsdata files from when exporting for localization.\n\n### Adjust Strings File Names for Info.plist\n\n**Setting name:** `STRINGS_FILE_INFOPLIST_RENAME`\n\nIf enabled, renames .strings files whose basename matches that of the target’s Info.plist file, to InfoPlist.strings in the built product.\n\n### Strings File Output Encoding\n\n**Setting name:** `STRINGS_FILE_OUTPUT_ENCODING`\n\nSpecify the output encoding to be used for Strings files - the default is UTF-16. The value can be either an `NSStringEncoding`, such as one of the numeric values recognized by `NSString`, or an IANA character set name as understood by `CFString`. It is recommended that the source file be in UTF-8 encoding, which is the default encoding for standard strings files, and Xcode will automatically process it to the output encoding. Processing will fail if the file cannot be converted to the specified encoding.\n\n### Generate String Catalog Symbols\n\n**Setting name:** `STRING_CATALOG_GENERATE_SYMBOLS`\n\nWhen enabled, symbols will be generated for manually-managed strings in String Catalogs.\n\n### Additional Strip Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `STRIPFLAGS`\n\nAdditional flags to be passed when stripping the linked product of the build.\n\n### Strip Linked Product\n\n**Setting name:** `STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT`\n\nIf enabled,  the linked product of the build will be stripped of symbols when performing deployment postprocessing.\n\n### Remove Text Metadata From PNG Files\n\n**Setting name:** `STRIP_PNG_TEXT`\n\nMetadata in the form of text chunks in PNG files will be removed to reduce their footprint on disk.\n\n### Strip Style\n\n**Setting name:** `STRIP_STYLE`\n\nThe level of symbol stripping to be performed on the linked product of the build. The default value is defined by the target’s product type.\n\n- *All Symbols:* Completely strips the binary, removing the symbol table and relocation information.

Defaults to the value of the `USER` environment variable.\n\n### Generated Versioning Variables\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_EXPORT_DECL`\n\nThis defines a prefix string for the version info symbol declaration in the generated Apple Generic Versioning stub. This can be used, for example, to add an optional `export` keyword to the version symbol declaration. This should rarely be changed.\n\n### Generated Versioning Source Filename\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_FILE`\n\nUsed to specify a name for the source file that will be generated by Apple Generic Versioning and compiled into your product. By default, this is set to `$(PRODUCT_NAME)_vers.c`.\n\n### Versioning Name Prefix\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_PREFIX`\n\nUsed as a prefix for the name of the version info symbol in the generated versioning source file. If you prefix your exported symbols you will probably want to set this to the same prefix.\n\n### Versioning Name Suffix\n\n**Setting name:** `VERSION_INFO_SUFFIX`\n\nUsed as a suffix for the name of the version info symbol in the generated versioning source file. This is rarely used.\n\n### Other Warning Flags\n\n**Setting name:** `WARNING_CFLAGS`\n\nSpace-separated list of additional warning flags to pass to the compiler.

Use this setting if Xcode does not already provide UI for a `yacc` flag.\n\n### Generated File Stem\n\n**Setting name:** `YACC_GENERATED_FILE_STEM`\n\nThe file stem to use for the files generated by `yacc`. The files will be named `<stem>.tab.c` and `<stem>.tab.h` based on the value of this setting. The Standard (`y`) option will cause all `yacc` source files in the same target to produce the same output file, and it is not recommended for targets containing multiple `yacc` source files.\n\n### Generate Debugging Directives\n\n**Setting name:** `YACC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_DIRECTIVES`\n\nEnabling this option changes the preprocessor directives generated by `yacc` so that debugging statements will be incorporated in the compiled code.\n\n### Insert #line Directives\n\n**Setting name:** `YACC_INSERT_LINE_DIRECTIVES`\n\nEnabling this option causes `yacc` to insert the `#line` directives in the generated code. The `#line` directives let the C compiler relate errors in the generated code to the user’s original code. If this option is disabled, `#line` directives specified by the user in the source file will still be retained.\n\n## Build settings\n\n- **Configuring the build settings of a target**: Specify the options you use to compile, link, and produce a product from a target, and identify settings inherited from your project or the system.\n- **Adding a build configuration file to your project**: Specify your project’s build settings in plain-text files, and supply different settings for debug and release builds.\n- **Identifying and addressing framework module issues**: Detect and fix common problems found in framework modules with the module verifier.\n- **Understanding build product layout changes in Xcode**\n\n",
