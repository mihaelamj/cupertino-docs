Verify that the certificate fingerprint matches the value you expect.\n\n\n\n### Diagnose build failures caused by code signature changes\n\nAn XCFramework’s code signature can change for legitimate reasons, like:\n\n- the provider of a third-party SDK transfers ownership of the SDK to another organization, who release a version that’s signed with the new organization’s Team ID.\n- you switch from a vendor-supplied distribution of an XCFramework to a version that you build and sign yourself.\n\nA changed code signature can also indicate that the XCFramework has been tampered with, or another actor has injected their own code into your system, pretending it’s a version of the XCFramework.\n\nIf the code signature for an XCFramework changes, Xcode shows the changed code signature information in the File inspector.\n\n\n\nIf you attempt to build the software without resolving the changed code signature information, the build system produces an error. Work with the XCFramework’s provider to determine whether the change is expected. If the change is expected, follow these steps:\n\n1. Switch to the Issues navigator.\n2. Select the error that says “[XCFramework name] is not signed with the expected identity and may have been compromised”.\n3. In the dialog that appears, click Accept Change.\n\n\n\nIf your team and the SDK provider can’t account for the change to the XCFramework’s code signature, restore a version of the framework with the expected code signature, or remove the framework from your project. To restore the framework to a version with the expected code signature, do the following:\n\n1. In the dialog, click Move to Trash.\n2. Switch to or open a new Finder window.\n3. Drag a replacement copy of the XCFramework from a trusted source to the Finder folder that contained the copy you deleted.\n4. Switch to Xcode, and verify that the XCFramework’s signature is valid in the File inspector.\n\n\n\nXcode also warns you if the XCFramework is signed with an expired or revoked code signing identity, even if the identity hasn’t changed since you added the XCFramework to your project. If this happens, work with the SDK provider to obtain a new version of the framework that’s signed by a valid code signing identity.\n\n### Diagnose failures caused when a code signature is removed\n\nIf someone removes the code signature for an XCFramework, Xcode shows the change in the File inspector.\n\n\n\nThe build system fails with an error if you attempt to build the software without resolving the removed code signature. Determine why the code signature is missing from the XCFramework. If you no longer expect the XCFramework to be signed, follow these steps:\n\n1. Switch to the Issues navigator.\n2.
