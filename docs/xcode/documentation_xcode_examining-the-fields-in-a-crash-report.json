  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nEach section of a crash report contains information to help you diagnose the source of a crash.\n\n\n\n### Header\n\nA crash report begins with a header section that describes the environment the crash occurred in.\n\nThe fields in the header can contain the following information. No single crash report contains all of these fields.\n\nThe `AppVariant` field contains three values separated by colons, for example, `1:iPhone10,6:12.2`. These fields represent:\n\n### Exception information\n\nEvery crash report contains exception information. This information section tells you how the process quit, but it may not fully explain why the app quit. This information is important, but is often overlooked.\n\nThe following fields provide information about the exception. No single crash report contains all of these fields.\n\n### Diagnostic messages\n\nThe operating system sometimes includes additional diagnostic information. This information uses a variety of formats, depending on reason for the crash, and isn’t present in every crash report.\n\nFramework error messages occurring just before the process exits appear in the `Application Specific Information` field. In this example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch] framework logged an error about incorrect use of a dispatch queue:\n\nProcess exits due to a watchdog violation contain a `Termination Description` field with information about why the watchdog triggered.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/addressing-watchdog-terminations] goes into more detail about watchdog terminations and how to interpret this information.\n\nProcess crashes due to a memory access issue contain information about the virtual memory regions in the `VM Region Info` field.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/investigating-memory-access-crashes] goes into more detail about this information.\n\n### Backtraces\n\nThe system captures each thread of the crashed process as a backtrace, documenting the code running on the thread when the process ends. The backtraces are similar to what you see when you pause the process with the debugger. Crashes caused by a language exception include an additional backtrace, the `Last Exception Backtrace`, located before the first thread. If your crash report contains a `Last Exception Backtrace`, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/addressing-language-exception-crashes] for information specific to language exception crashes.\n\nThe first line of each backtrace lists the thread number and the thread name. For privacy reasons, crash reports delivered through the [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev675635e70] in Xcode don’t contain thread names. This example shows the backtraces for three threads; `Thread 0` crashed, and is identified as the app’s main thread by its name:\n\nAfter the thread number, each line of a backtrace represents a stack frame in the backtrace.\n\nEach column of the stack frame contains information about the code executing at the time of the crash. The following list uses the components of stack frame 0 from the example above.\n\nIn some situations, the file name or the line number information won’t correspond to the orginial source code:\n\n### Thread state\n\nThe thread state section of a crash report lists the CPU registers and their values for the crashed thread when the app crashes. Understanding the thread state is an advanced topic that requires understanding of the application binary interface (ABI). See [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms].\n\nRegisters provide extra information for crashes caused by memory access issues. [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/analyzing-a-crash-report#Understand-the-crashed-threads-registers] discusses that scenario further.\n\n### Binary images\n\nThe binary images section of a crash report lists all code loaded in the process at the time that it crashes, such as the app executable and system frameworks. Each line in the Binary Images section represents a single binary image. iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS use the following format:\n\nThis list contains the components from the preceding example:\n\nmacOS uses the following format for this section:\n\nThis list contains the components from the preceding example:",

No single crash report contains all of these fields.\n\n- `Incident Identifier`: A unique identifier for the report. Two reports never share the same `Incident Identifier`.\n- `CrashReporter Key`: An anonymized per-device identifier. Two reports from the same device contain identical values. This identifier is reset upon erasing the device.\n- `Beta Identifier`: A unique identifier for the combination of the device and vendor of the crashed application. Two reports for apps from the same vendor and from the same device contain identical values. This field is only present for TestFlight builds of an app, and replaces the `CrashReporter Key` field.\n- `Hardware Model`: The specific device model the app was running on.\n- `Process`: The executable name for the process that crashed. This matches the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/CFBundleExecutable] value in the app’s information property list. The number in brackets is the process ID.\n- `Path`: The location of the executable on disk. macOS replaces user-identifable path components with placeholder values to protect privacy.\n- `Identifier`: The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/CFBundleIdentifier] of the process that crashed. If the binary doesn’t have a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/CFBundleIdentifier], this field contains either the process name or a placeholder value.\n- `Version`: The version of the process that crashed. The value is a concatenation of the app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/CFBundleVersion] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/CFBundleShortVersionString].\n- `AppStoreTools`: The version of Xcode used to compile your app’s bitcode and to thin your app to device specific variants.\n- `AppVariant`: The specific variant of your app produced by app thinning. This field contains multiple values, described later in this section.\n- `Code Type`: The CPU architecture of the process that crashed. The value is one of `ARM-64`, `ARM`, `X86-64`, or `X86`.\n- `Role`: The [https:\/\/opensource.apple.com\/source\/xnu\/xnu-3248.60.10\/osfmk\/mach\/task_policy.h] assigned to the process at the time it crashes. This field is generally not helpful when you analyze a crash report.\n- `Parent Process`: The name and process ID (in square brackets) of the process that launched the crashed process.\n- `Coalition`: The name of the process coalition containing the app. Process coalitions track resource usage among groups of related processes, such as an operating system process supporting a specific API’s functionality in an app. Most processes, including app extensions, form their own coalition.\n- `Date\/Time`: The date and time of the crash.\n- `Launch Time`: The date and time the app launched.\n- `OS Version`: The operating system version, including the build number, on which the crash occurred.\n\nThe `AppVariant` field contains three values separated by colons, for example, `1:iPhone10,6:12.2`. These fields represent:\n\n- An internal system value. This value isn’t useful for diagnosing a crash. In the example, this value is `1`.\n- The name of the thinning variant. The variant represents a class of devices with similar characteristics, such as screen scale, memory class, and Metal GPU family. The thinning variant’s name doesn’t indicate the exact hardware model the crash report is from, and may differ from the `Hardware Model` field. In the example, this value is `iPhone10,6`.\n- The operating system version variant. For each class of devices, app thinning creates additional variants for different versions of the operating system. In the example, this value is `12.2`, indicating this variant targets iOS devices running iOS 12.2 or higher.\n\n### Exception information\n\nEvery crash report contains exception information. This information section tells you how the process quit, but it may not fully explain why the app quit. This information is important, but is often overlooked.\n\n```other\nException Type:  EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)\nException Codes: 0x0000000000000001, 0x0000000102afb3d0\n```\n\n\n\nThe following fields provide information about the exception. No single crash report contains all of these fields.\n\n- `Exception Type`: The name of the Mach exception that quit the process, along with the name of the corresponding BSD signal in parentheses. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/understanding-the-exception-types-in-a-crash-report].\n- `Exception Codes`: Processor specific information about the exception encoded into one or more 64-bit hexadecimal numbers. Typically, this field isn’t present because the operating system presents the information as human-readable information in the other fields of this section.\n- `Exception Subtype`: The human-readable description of the exception codes.\n- `Exception Message`: Additional human-readable information extracted from the exception codes.\n- `Exception Note`: Additional information that isn’t specific to one exception type. If this field contains `EXC_CORPSE_NOTIFY`, the crash didn’t originate from a hardware trap, either because the process was explicitly quit by the operating system or the process called `abort()`. If this field contains `SIMULATED (this is NOT a crash)`, the process didn’t crash, but the operating system might have subsequently requested that the process quit. If this field contains `NON-FATAL CONDITION (this is NOT a crash)`, the process didn’t exit, because the issue that created the crash report wasn’t fatal.\n- `Termination Reason`: Exit reason information specified when the operating system quits a process. Key operating system components, both inside and outside of a process, quit the process upon encountering a fatal error and record the reason in this field. Examples of the information you can find in this field are messages about an invalid code signature, a missing dependent library, or accessing privacy sensitive information without a purpose string.\n- `Triggered by Thread` or `Crashed Thread`: The thread on which the exception originated.\n\n### Diagnostic messages\n\nThe operating system sometimes includes additional diagnostic information. This information uses a variety of formats, depending on reason for the crash, and isn’t present in every crash report.\n\nFramework error messages occurring just before the process exits appear in the `Application Specific Information` field. In this example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Dispatch] framework logged an error about incorrect use of a dispatch queue:\n\n```other\nApplication Specific Information:\nBUG IN CLIENT OF LIBDISPATCH: dispatch_sync called on queue already owned by current thread\n```\n\n\n\nProcess exits due to a watchdog violation contain a `Termination Description` field with information about why the watchdog triggered.\n\n```other\nTermination Description: SPRINGBOARD, \n    scene-create watchdog transgression: application<com.example.MyCoolApp>:667\n    exhausted real (wall clock) time allowance of 19.97 seconds \n```\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/addressing-watchdog-terminations] goes into more detail about watchdog terminations and how to interpret this information.\n\nProcess crashes due to a memory access issue contain information about the virtual memory regions in the `VM Region Info` field.\n\n```other\nVM Region Info: 0 is not in any region.

The backtraces are similar to what you see when you pause the process with the debugger. Crashes caused by a language exception include an additional backtrace, the `Last Exception Backtrace`, located before the first thread. If your crash report contains a `Last Exception Backtrace`, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/addressing-language-exception-crashes] for information specific to language exception crashes.\n\nThe first line of each backtrace lists the thread number and the thread name. For privacy reasons, crash reports delivered through the [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev675635e70] in Xcode don’t contain thread names. This example shows the backtraces for three threads; `Thread 0` crashed, and is identified as the app’s main thread by its name:\n\n```other\nThread 0 name:  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread\nThread 0 Crashed:\n0   TouchCanvas                       0x0000000102afb3d0 CanvasView.updateEstimatedPropertiesForTouches(_:) + 62416 (CanvasView.swift:231)\n1   TouchCanvas                       0x0000000102afb3d0 CanvasView.updateEstimatedPropertiesForTouches(_:) + 62416 (CanvasView.swift:231)\n2   TouchCanvas                       0x0000000102af7d10 ViewController.touchesMoved(_:with:) + 48400 (<compiler-generated>:0)\n3   TouchCanvas                       0x0000000102af80b8 @objc ViewController.touchesMoved(_:with:) + 49336 (<compiler-generated>:0)\n4   UIKitCore                         0x00000001ba9d8da4 forwardTouchMethod + 328\n5   UIKitCore                         0x00000001ba9d8e40 -[UIResponder touchesMoved:withEvent:] + 60\n6   UIKitCore                         0x00000001ba9d8da4 forwardTouchMethod + 328\n7   UIKitCore                         0x00000001ba9d8e40 -[UIResponder touchesMoved:withEvent:] + 60\n8   UIKitCore                         0x00000001ba9e6ea4 -[UIWindow _sendTouchesForEvent:] + 1896\n9   UIKitCore                         0x00000001ba9e8390 -[UIWindow sendEvent:] + 3352\n10  UIKitCore                         0x00000001ba9c4a9c -[UIApplication sendEvent:] + 344\n11  UIKitCore                         0x00000001baa3cc20 __dispatchPreprocessedEventFromEventQueue + 5880\n12  UIKitCore                         0x00000001baa3f17c __handleEventQueueInternal + 4924\n13  UIKitCore                         0x00000001baa37ff0 __handleHIDEventFetcherDrain + 108\n14  CoreFoundation                    0x00000001b68a4a00 __CFRUNLOOP_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_A_SOURCE0_PERFORM_FUNCTION__ + 24\n15  CoreFoundation                    0x00000001b68a4958 __CFRunLoopDoSource0 + 80\n16  CoreFoundation                    0x00000001b68a40f0 __CFRunLoopDoSources0 + 180\n17  CoreFoundation                    0x00000001b689f23c __CFRunLoopRun + 1080\n18  CoreFoundation                    0x00000001b689eadc CFRunLoopRunSpecific + 464\n19  GraphicsServices                  0x00000001c083f328 GSEventRunModal + 104\n20  UIKitCore                         0x00000001ba9ac63c UIApplicationMain + 1936\n21  TouchCanvas                       0x0000000102af16dc main + 22236 (AppDelegate.swift:12)\n22  libdyld.dylib                     0x00000001b6728360 start + 4\n\nThread 1:\n0   libsystem_pthread.dylib           0x00000001b6645758 start_wqthread + 0\n\nThread 2:\n0   libsystem_pthread.dylib           0x00000001b6645758 start_wqthread + 0\n...\n```\n\nAfter the thread number, each line of a backtrace represents a stack frame in the backtrace.\n\n```other\n0   TouchCanvas                       0x0000000102afb3d0 CanvasView.updateEstimatedPropertiesForTouches(_:) + 62416 (CanvasView.swift:231)\n```\n\nEach column of the stack frame contains information about the code executing at the time of the crash. The following list uses the components of stack frame 0 from the example above.\n\n- `0`. The stack frame number. Stack frames are in calling order, where frame 0 is the function that was executing at the time execution halted. Frame 1 is the function that called the function in frame 0, and so on.\n- `TouchCanvas`. The name of the binary containing the function that is executing.\n- `0x0000000102afb3d0`. The address of the machine instruction that is executing. For frame 0 in each backtrace, this is the address of the machine instruction executing on a thread when the process ends. For other stack frames, this is the address of first machine instruction that executes after control returns to that stack frame.\n- `CanvasView.updateEstimatedPropertiesForTouches(_:)`. In a fully symbolicated crash report, the name of the function that is executing. For privacy reasons, the function name is sometimes limited to the first 100 characters.\n- `62416`. The number after the `+` is the byte offset from the function’s entry point to the current instruction in the function.\n- `CanvasView.swift:231`. The file name and line number containing the code, if you have a `dSYM` file for the binary.\n\nIn some situations, the file name or the line number information won’t correspond to the orginial source code:\n\n- If the source file name is `<compiler-generated>`, the compiler created the code for that frame, and the code isn’t in your source files. If this is top frame in the crashed thread, look at the preceeding few stack frames for clues.\n- If the line number for a source file is `0`, this means the backtrace doesn’t map to a specific line of code in the original code. This is because the compiler optimized the code, such as by inlining functions, and the code executing at the time of the crash doesn’t correspond to an exact line in the orignial code. The function name for the frame is still a clue in this situation.\n\n### Thread state\n\nThe thread state section of a crash report lists the CPU registers and their values for the crashed thread when the app crashes. Understanding the thread state is an advanced topic that requires understanding of the application binary interface (ABI). See [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms].\n\n```other\nThread 0 crashed with ARM Thread State (64-bit):\n    x0: 0x0000000000000001   x1: 0x0000000000000000   x2: 0x0000000000000000   x3: 0x000000000000000f\n    x4: 0x00000000000001c2   x5: 0x000000010327f6c0   x6: 0x000000010327f724   x7: 0x0000000000000120\n    x8: 0x0000000000000001   x9: 0x0000000000000001  x10: 0x0000000000000001  x11: 0x0000000000000000\n   x12: 0x00000001038612b0  x13: 0x000005a102b075a7  x14: 0x0000000000000100  x15: 0x0000010000000000\n   x16: 0x00000001c3e6c630  x17: 0x00000001bae4bbf8  x18: 0x0000000000000000  x19: 0x0000000282c14280\n   x20: 0x00000001fe64a3e0  x21: 0x4000000281f1df10  x22: 0x0000000000000001  x23: 0x0000000000000000\n   x24: 0x0000000000000000  x25: 0x0000000282c14280  x26: 0x0000000103203140  x27: 0x00000001bacf4b7c\n   x28: 0x00000001fe5ded08   fp: 0x000000016d311310   lr: 0x0000000102afb3d0\n    sp: 0x000000016d311200   pc: 0x0000000102afb3d0 cpsr: 0x60000000\n   esr: 0xf2000001  Address size fault\n```\n\nRegisters provide extra information for crashes caused by memory access issues. [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/analyzing-a-crash-report#Understand-the-crashed-threads-registers] discusses that scenario further.\n\n### Binary images\n\nThe binary images section of a crash report lists all code loaded in the process at the time that it crashes, such as the app executable and system frameworks. Each line in the Binary Images section represents a single binary image. iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS use the following format:\n\n```other\nBinary Images:\n0x102aec000 - 0x102b03fff TouchCanvas arm64  <fe7745ae12db30fa886c8baa1980437a> \/var\/containers\/Bundle\/Application\/51346174-37EF-4F60-B72D-8DE5F01035F5\/TouchCanvas.app\/TouchCanvas\n...\n```\n\nThis list contains the components from the preceding example:\n\n- `0x102aec000 - 0x102b03fff`. The binary image’s address range within the process. The first address is the binary’s load address. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-identifiable-symbol-names-to-a-crash-report#Symbolicate-the-crash-report-with-the-command-line] for how to use this value.\n- `TouchCanvas`. The binary name.\n- `arm64`. The CPU architecture from the binary image that the operating system loaded into the process.\n- `fe7745ae12db30fa886c8baa1980437a`. A build UUID that uniquely identifies the binary image. Use this value to locate the corresponding `dSYM` file when symbolicating the crash report. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information] for more information on build UUIDs.\n- `\/var\/containers\/...\/TouchCanvas.app\/TouchCanvas`. The path to the binary on disk. macOS replaces user-identifable path components with placeholder values to protect privacy.\n\nmacOS uses the following format for this section:\n\n```other\nBinary Images:\n       0x1025e5000 -        0x1025e6ffb +com.example.apple-samplecode.TouchCanvas (1.0 - 1) <5ED9BD63-2A55-3DDD-B3FF-EFCF61382F6F> \/Users\/USER\/*\/TouchCanvas.app\/Contents\/MacOS\/TouchCanvas\n```\n\nThis list contains the components from the preceding example:\n\n- `0x105f97000 - 0x105f98ffb`. The binary image’s address range within the process. The first address is the binary’s load address. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-identifiable-symbol-names-to-a-crash-report#Symbolicate-the-crash-report-with-the-command-line] for how to use this value.\n- `+com.example.apple-samplecode.TouchCanvas`. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/CFBundleIdentifier] of the binary. The `+` prefix indicates the binary is not part of macOS.\n- `1.0 - 1`. The binary’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/CFBundleShortVersionString] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/CFBundleVersion].\n- `5ED9BD63-2A55-3DDD-B3FF-EFCF61382F6F`. A build UUID that uniquely identifies the binary image. Use this value to locate the corresponding `dSYM` file when symbolicating the crash report. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information] for more information on build UUIDs.\n- `\/Users\/USER\/*\/TouchCanvas.app\/Contents\/MacOS\/TouchCanvas`. The path to the binary on disk. macOS replaces user-identifable path components with placeholder values to protect privacy.\n\n## Crash reports\n\n- **Adding identifiable symbol names to a crash report**: Replace hexadecimal addresses in a crash report with function names and line numbers that correspond to your app’s code.\n- **Identifying the cause of common crashes**: Find patterns in crash reports that identify common problems, and investigate the issue based on the pattern.\n- **Analyzing a crash report**: Identify clues in a crash report that help you diagnose problems.\n- **Interpreting the JSON format of a crash report**: Understand the structure and properties of the objects the system includes in the JSON of a crash report.\n- **Understanding the exception types in a crash report**: Learn what the exception type tells you about why your app crashed.\n\n",
