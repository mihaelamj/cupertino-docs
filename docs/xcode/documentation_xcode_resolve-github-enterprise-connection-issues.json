As a result, you may run into issues where Xcode Cloud can’t access your Git repository and can’t start builds. In this case, Xcode and App Store Connect display messages that indicate configuration or permission issues.\n\nCommon reasons for these issues are:\n\n- The administrator of your GitHub Enterprise instance changed permissions; for example, permissions for the GitHub Enterprise app that Xcode Cloud uses to access your repository.\n- The callback URL of your GitHub Enterprise instance changed.\n- The GitHub Enterprise app that Xcode Cloud uses to connect to your repository received an update and requires permission updates.\n\nFixes for permission and configuration issues depend on your GitHub Enterprise instance, but common ways to re-enable Xcode Cloud to connect to your repository include:\n\n- Visit your GitHub Enterprise team’s settings page and look for outstanding requested permission updates.\n- Visit the settings page for the GitHub app that manages access to your Git repositories, and verify the callback URL. Additionally, verify that the configured permissions and events match those in the table and list below.\n\nRequired permissions:\n\n\n\nRequired events:\n\n- Create\n- Check Run\n- Check Suite\n- Delete\n- Pull Request\n- Pull Request Review\n- Push\n- Repository\n\nAs a last resort, you can disconnect Xcode Cloud from your GitHub Enterprise repository as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Removing-Your-Project-from-Xcode-Cloud#Disconnect-your-Git-repository-in-Xcode-Cloud] and uninstall the app that guards access to your GitHub Enterprise repository as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Removing-Your-Project-from-Xcode-Cloud#Remove-personal-access-tokens-or-apps].
