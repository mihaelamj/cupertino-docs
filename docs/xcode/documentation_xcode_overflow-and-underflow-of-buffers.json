  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIn Xcode 7 and later, you can use this check to detect when you access memory that’s outside of a buffer’s boundaries. The check reports overflow when accessed memory is beyond the end of the buffer, and underflow when the accessed memory is before the beginning of a buffer. Xcode sanitizes heap and stack buffers, as well as global variables. Buffer overflow and underflow can result in a crash or other unpredictable behavior.\n\n### Global, heap, and stack overflows in C\n\nIn the following example, the `global_array`, `heap_buffer`, and `stack_buffer` variables each have valid indexes in the range `[0, 9]`, but the accessed index is `10`, which causes an overflow:\n\n#### Solution\n\nAdd a bounds check before attempting to access a buffer at a specific index.",
