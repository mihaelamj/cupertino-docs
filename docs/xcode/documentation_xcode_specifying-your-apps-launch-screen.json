The launch screen appears instantly when your app starts up and is quickly replaced with the app’s first screen.\n\nYou create a launch screen for your app in your Xcode project in one of two ways:\n\n- Information property list\n- User interface file\n\nTo make the app launch experience as seamless as possible, create a launch screen with basic views that closely resemble the first screen of your app.\nFor guidelines about designing a launch screen, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/patterns\/launching\/] in the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/guidelines\/overview].\n\n### Configure a launch screen in an information property list\n\nFor apps with simple user interfaces, using the information property list in your app provides a quick and straightforward method to configure your launch screen.\n\n1. In the settings for your target, select the Info tab.\n2. In the Custom iOS Target Properties section, expand the Launch Screen key.\n3. Click the Add button (+), type in `UILaunchScreen`, and press Return to add the launch screen key to the property list. If the `UILaunchScreen` key is already present, you can skip this step.\n4. Select the `UILaunchScreen` key, click the Add button (+), and add additional keys to specify configuration options for your launch screen.\n\n\n\nDefine the appearance of the launch screen by specifying a combination of launch screen options from the possible keys in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/UILaunchScreen].\n\n### Configure a launch screen storyboard\n\nAlternatively, you can configure your launch screen in a user interface file, a file with a `.storyboard` file extension. A launch screen storyboard contains basic UIKit views, and uses size classes and Auto Layout constraints to support different device sizes and resolutions.\n\nFollow these guidelines when creating a launch screen storyboard:\n\n- Use only UIKit classes.\n- Use a single root view that’s a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController] object.\n- Don’t make any connections to your code, for example, don’t add actions or outlets.\n- Don’t use deprecated views such as `UIWebView`.\n- Don’t use any custom classes.\n- Don’t use runtime attributes.\n\nIf you create your iOS app from a storyboard template, Xcode adds a default launch screen file, called `LaunchScreen.storyboard`, to your project. Edit `LaunchScreen.storyboard` to configure your launch screen.\n\nIf your project doesn’t contain a default launch screen file, add a launch screen file and set the launch screen file for the target in the project editor.\n\n1. Choose File > New > File from Template.\n2. Under User Interface, select Launch Screen, and click Next.\n3. Give the launch screen file a name, choose a location, select the target that you want to add the file to, and click Create.\n4. In the settings for your target, select the General tab and find the “App Icons and Launch Screen” section.\n5. From the Launch Screen File pop-up menu, choose the new launch screen file.\n\n\n\n## App icons and launch screen\n\n- **Creating your app icon using Icon Composer**: Use Icon Composer to stylize your app icon for different platforms and appearances.\n- **Configuring your app to use alternate app icons**: Add alternate app icons to your app, and let people choose which icon to display.\n- **Configuring your app icon using an asset catalog**: Add app icon variations to an asset catalog that represents your app in places such as the App Store, the Home Screen, Settings, and search results.\n\n",
