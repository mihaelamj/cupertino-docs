To open the Project navigator, at the top of your project window’s navigator area, click the icon that resembles a file folder.\n\n\n\nWhen you select a file in the navigator, the inspector pane displays information about the file, and the editor area displays the contents of the file. The appearance of the editor area changes based on the type of file you select. For example, a source code file displays the source editor, and a property-list file displays the property-list editor.\n\nTo locate files based on keywords or other criteria, use the filter bar at the bottom of the navigator area:\n\n### Add new files to a project\n\nXcode provides templates for the common types of files you might want to add to your project, such as Swift files or playgrounds. In the Project navigator, select the folder or group where you want to add a file and perform one of the following actions:\n\nIn the new file sheet, select a template for your new file. Xcode organizes templates by type to make them easier to find. You can also use the filter control to search for templates by name. After you select a template, click Next.\n\n\n\nSome templates require you to specify additional information for the new file. For example, the Cocoa Touch template asks you to specify information about the class you’re creating, including the parent class name. Xcode uses this information to populate the file with some initial content.\n\nThe final step is to save your file to the file system. When Xcode prompts you for the file’s location, it also asks you to specify group and target information. The group indicates where in your project to place the file, and Xcode selects a default group based on contextual information. Xcode also selects a default target. Make any relevant changes to the target and group values and click Create to create the file.\n\n\n\n### Add existing files and folders to a project\n\nXcode offers several ways to add existing files and folders to your project. You can:\n\nXcode prompts you to select the files and folders to add and configure how you want to add them to your project. If the file you’re adding requires a target, select at least one target.

You can create additional groups and folders to organize your content and make it easier to navigate large projects.\n\nIn the Project navigator, create and modify groups using direct interaction or menu commands:\n\n### Delete files and folders\n\nTo delete a file or folder from your project, select it and press the Delete key, or select Edit > Delete. Xcode prompts you to choose how to delete any selected items.\n\n### Convert groups to folders\n\nThere are several benefits to using folders instead of groups when organizing your Xcode project files. Folders have a much smaller representation in the project file, which can result in fewer merge conflicts because when you add or remove files to the project you don’t modify the project file. Additionally, your Xcode project file automatically updates as you make changes to the file system.\n\nTo convert a group into a folder using the Convert to Folder option within the Project navigator:\n\nXcode checks to see if the groups in your Xcode project match the underlying files and directories on disk. If they do, Xcode converts each group into a folder. If the groups and underlying directory structures don’t match, Xcode displays a dialog with a Show Details button. Click the Show Details button to see a list of the files and directories Xcode couldn’t convert.\n\nTo convert the files Xcode displays in Show Details, make the file and directory structure in Xcode match what Finder displays on disk. Either modify the file and group structure in Xcode to match the file and directory structure in Finder, or modify the file and directory structure in Finder to match the contents of your groups in Xcode.

For example, a source code file displays the source editor, and a property-list file displays the property-list editor.\n\nTo locate files based on keywords or other criteria, use the filter bar at the bottom of the navigator area:\n\n- To search for files, enter keywords in the filter bar’s text field.\n- To show only recently modified files, click the Recent Files icon.\n- To show only files with a changed source-control status, click the Source Control icon.\n\n### Add new files to a project\n\nXcode provides templates for the common types of files you might want to add to your project, such as Swift files or playgrounds. In the Project navigator, select the folder or group where you want to add a file and perform one of the following actions:\n\n1. Click the Add button (+) in the filter bar and choose File from the pop-up menu.\n2. Choose New > File.\n3. Control-click and select New File.\n\nIn the new file sheet, select a template for your new file. Xcode organizes templates by type to make them easier to find. You can also use the filter control to search for templates by name. After you select a template, click Next.\n\n\n\nSome templates require you to specify additional information for the new file.

You can:\n\n- Drag the files from the Finder into the Project navigator.\n- Click the Add button (+) in the Project navigator’s filter bar, and choose Add Files to “*projectName*”.\n- Choose File > Add Files to “*projectName*”.\n\nXcode prompts you to select the files and folders to add and configure how you want to add them to your project. If the file you’re adding requires a target, select at least one target. Then, select one of the following options from the Action picker:\n\n\n\nNext from the Group picker, choose how you want to group folders:\n\n\n\nWhen adding a local Swift Package’s folder to your project, perform the following additional steps:\n\n- Place the package in a Packages group to make it easier to track. To create a new group in the project navgator, select File > New > Group. Drag the package from the Finder into the group.\n- Add the package to the linked libraries build phase in your project settings. In the Project Editor, Select Build Phases and expand Link Binary With Libraries. Click the plus (+) button and select the package from your workspace.\n\nFor more information about managing Swift packages, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/swift-packages].\n\n\n\n### Organize project files in the navigator\n\nMost new projects contain some structure to organize the project’s content — for example, to separate source files from generated products. You can create additional groups and folders to organize your content and make it easier to navigate large projects.\n\n- A folder is a file-system directory that you reference from your project. Xcode includes the contents of the folder in your project.\n- A group is a collection of resources in your project. By default, Xcode maps each group to a folder in your project directory, but you can also create groups without an underlying file-system folder. You might use groups without folders if you want to manage files in your project without changing the underlying organization of the files on disk.\n\nIn the Project navigator, create and modify groups using direct interaction or menu commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n### Delete files and folders\n\nTo delete a file or folder from your project, select it and press the Delete key, or select Edit > Delete. Xcode prompts you to choose how to delete any selected items.\n\n\n\n### Convert groups to folders\n\nThere are several benefits to using folders instead of groups when organizing your Xcode project files. Folders have a much smaller representation in the project file, which can result in fewer merge conflicts because when you add or remove files to the project you don’t modify the project file. Additionally, your Xcode project file automatically updates as you make changes to the file system.\n\nTo convert a group into a folder using the Convert to Folder option within the Project navigator:\n\n1. Select one or more groups in your Project navigator.\n2. Control-click the selected group(s) and select Convert to Folder.\n\nXcode checks to see if the groups in your Xcode project match the underlying files and directories on disk. If they do, Xcode converts each group into a folder. If the groups and underlying directory structures don’t match, Xcode displays a dialog with a Show Details button. Click the Show Details button to see a list of the files and directories Xcode couldn’t convert.\n\nTo convert the files Xcode displays in Show Details, make the file and directory structure in Xcode match what Finder displays on disk.
