You can enable API Validation using the runtime diagnostics options in Xcode, or by using environment variables.\n\n\n\n### Enable API Validation in Xcode\n\nFollow these steps to enable API Validation using the runtime diagnostics options in the scheme settings:\n\n1. In the Xcode toolbar, choose Edit Scheme from the Scheme menu. Alternatively, choose Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme. \n2. In the scheme action panel, select Run.\n3. In the action setting tab, click Diagnostics.\n4. Select API Validation to enable it, and click Close. \n\nNow, the API Validation runtime is enabled each time you run your scheme.\n\n### Enable API Validation with environment variables\n\nYou can also enable API Validation by setting the following environment variables on your Metal app:\n\n\n\nFor a complete list of settings, run `man MetalValidation` in Terminal.\n\n## Runtime diagnostics\n\n- **Inspecting live resources at runtime**: Validate your resources by viewing the contents of your textures and buffers while debugging your Metal app.\n- **Validating your app’s Metal shader usage**: Catch common shader runtime issues using Shader Validation while your app is running.\n- **Monitoring your Metal app’s graphics performance**: Catch performance issues using the Metal Performance HUD while your app runs.\n- **Customizing the Metal Performance HUD**: Modify the appearance of your Metal heads-up display to monitor your graphics performance.\n- **Understanding the Metal Performance HUD metrics**: Learn what each of the metrics reported by the heads-up display indicates.\n- **Gaining performance insights with the Metal Performance HUD**: Catch potential performance issues while your app runs using the Metal heads-up display.\n- **Generating performance reports with the Metal Performance HUD**: Record your app’s performance using the heads-up display.\n\n",
