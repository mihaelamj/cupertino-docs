  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo adopt continuous integration and delivery (CI\/CD) with Xcode Cloud, you’ll need to configure your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud, create your first workflow, and then start your first build. However, starting to use Xcode Cloud as a team may require additional steps and coordination among team members and administrators — especially in a corporate context.\n\nTo successfully configure your team’s project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud, first review required roles and permissions described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Setting-up-your-project-to-use-Xcode-Cloud]. Depending on your role and permissions, you may need to coordinate with others to:\n\nIf you have the required role and permissions to complete the above tasks or someone else has previously performed them, configure your team’s project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Your-First-Xcode-Cloud-Workflow]. However, teams may limit the number of people who can administer their Git repositories and their App Store Connect account. In a corporate context, there might even be a dedicated infrastructure team, which means you need to work with them before you start using Xcode Cloud.\n\nFor additional information about using Xcode Cloud as a team, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc22\/110375].\n\n### Connect Xcode Cloud to an admin-managed Git repository\n\nTo start using Xcode Cloud, you need the permissions listed in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Setting-up-your-project-to-use-Xcode-Cloud] to grant Xcode Cloud access to your team’s Git repository. If you don’t have the required role or permission, work with your team’s source code management (SCM) administrator and ask them to configure your project to use Xcode Cloud.\n\nYou only need to work with your team’s SCM administrator when you onboard your team’s first app or framework to Xcode Cloud. When the SCM administrator configures Xcode Cloud for one project or workspace and connects your team’s SCM provider to Xcode Cloud, other projects you host with the same provider can use the configured connection. For example, say your team hosts its repositories on Bitbucket Cloud and your team’s administrator configures one project to use Xcode Cloud. When you start using Xcode Cloud for subsequent projects that use Bitbucket Cloud, you reuse the connection to Bitbucket Cloud that your administrator configured.\n\nTo connect Xcode Cloud to an admin-managed Git Repository:\n\n### Create an app record in App Store Connect\n\nXcode Cloud combines [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/xcode\/], [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/testflight\/], and [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] into a powerful CI\/CD system. As a result, you need an app record for your app in App Store Connect to use Xcode Cloud. If you haven’t created an app record for your app, Xcode helps you create one when you configure your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud.\n\nFor more information about the requirements for creating an app record, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Setting-up-your-project-to-use-Xcode-Cloud#Set-up-your-App-Store-Connect-account]. If you can’t create an app record, let someone who has the required role or permission create an app record in App Store Connect. Then configure your project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Configuring-Your-First-Xcode-Cloud-Workflow].\n\n### Connect your personal SCM account to Xcode Cloud\n\nXcode Cloud uses your personal SCM account to monitor the Git repository for changes. As a result, you need to connect your Xcode Cloud to your SCM account. To do this, open a project or workspace that another team member configured to use Xcode Cloud. If you haven’t connected your personal SCM account to Xcode Cloud, Xcode displays the Cloud Issues button in the toolbar. Click the button, and authorize Xcode Cloud to link your source control account with your Apple Account.",
