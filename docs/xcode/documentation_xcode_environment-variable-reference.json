When you create a custom workflow, you configure the temporary build environment Xcode Cloud uses, start conditions, actions, and other settings. However, you may need to perform custom tasks, for example, installing a third-party tool or uploading a build’s artifacts to your server. To achieve this, Xcode Cloud supports running custom shell scripts, referred to as *custom build scripts*.\n\nXcode Cloud includes a set of predefined environment variables that you can use to write flexible custom build scripts with advanced control flows. For example, access the `CI_XCODEBUILD_ACTION` variable in your script to determine which action is running and use this information to run a specific command. You can also use the absence of a variable to change your custom build script’s control flow.\n\nFor more information on using custom build scripts and accessing environment variables, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/Writing-Custom-Build-Scripts].\n\n### Variables that are always available\n\nThe following environment variables are available every time Xcode Cloud starts a build, no matter which actions or start conditions you configure for a workflow:\n\n### Variables for specific start conditions\n\nThe availability of the following environment variables depends on the workflow’s start condition you configure.
