  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nMultiplatform apps broaden the experience of your app to each additional platform you support. In Xcode 14 or later, you can share your app’s project settings and code across platforms using a single, multiplatform target.\n\nIn Xcode, an *app target* specifies project settings information like your app’s bundle identifier and display name, as well as which source code files belong to your app. By default, apps that share a multiplatform target share project settings, so you only need to set them once. You can adjust your project settings as needed for individual platforms.\n\nBefore you combine targets into a multiplatform target, check your app to determine the differences in build configuration, framework availability, and API availability.\n\n### Evaluate the project settings and code your apps share\n\nIf you want to bring an existing app to a new platform, consider the technologies you use on the platform you already support and the additional platforms you plan to build for. If the technologies and project settings that you plan to use overlap considerably, multiplatform app targets are a good fit. Otherwise, use a separate target for each platform. For example, if your existing app uses SwiftUI and you plan to use SwiftUI for the new platform, use one multiplatform target. However, if your existing app uses UIKit and you want to use AppKit for the Mac, use separate targets.\n\nIf your app already supports multiple platforms and shares substantial amounts of code and configuration between those projects, consider combining your multiple targets into a single target. In particular, if you’re developing your app in SwiftUI, your app targets likely already share a lot of the same code and configuration. You can use a single `App` structure to define the SwiftUI app life cycle for each platform.\n\nIf your app already supports multiple platforms, but you’ve been building each platform separately for a long time, the targets might not share much code or configuration. In these cases, continue using separate targets unless you have a longer term plan for converging platform support.\n\n### Configure the supported destinations for a target\n\nTo add a destination to a target, click the Add (+) button under Supported Destinations, and then select the destination you’d like to add. Depending on the platforms your app already supports, the Add (+) button brings up a different set of destinations that are available to add to the current target. To remove a destination from a target, select the destination, then click the Remove (-) button. The following shows an app target that supports iPhone and iPad:\n\n\n\nThe following shows the additional destinations available to that target:\n\n\n\nIf you’re adding a Mac or Apple Vision destination to a target, choose the destination type that matches the kind of experience you want to provide:\n\n### Customize project settings\n\nAdding support for another platform can reveal places in your project where you want to customize your app for one of the platforms you support or for a new build configuration. You can conditionalize build settings either by build configuration or by platform. Use the Add (+) button next to the setting you want to customize.\n\nThe following shows an app that adds “Beta” to the app’s display name in the Beta build configuration and adds “Mobile” to the iOS app’s display name in the Release configuration:\n\n\n\n### Resolve build issues by adding conditional statements\n\nAdding another platform can also reveal build-time issues in your app. To resolve those issues, insert conditional statements around any code that uses platform-specific APIs or frameworks. For example, an app that includes an AR experience in iOS and iPadOS likely contains code that uses ARKit. ARKit isn’t available in macOS or tvOS, so you need to separate out code that uses platform-specific APIs or frameworks.\n\nXcode identifies this sort of build-time issue when you build your project. To try a build on a new platform, pick the new run destination in the scheme menu that corresponds with the platform you added. If Xcode identifies any issues, navigate to them one-by-one and use the following steps to resolve them.\n\n**Address unavailable frameworks.** If a framework isn’t available for a platform, surround the import with a `canImport` conditional statement:\n\n**Address unavailable APIs.** Frameworks that are available across multiple platforms might have individual symbols likes types, methods, or enumeration cases that are restricted to a subset of platforms. To resolve these availability issues, surround the relevant code with an `#if os` platform compilation condition statement:\n\nIf an entire file is platform specific, you can remove it entirely from the platforms where it’s not applicable. In the target editor for your project, go to Build Phases > Compile Sources, and deselect the source file from the Filters column.\n\n\n\n### Customize the experience of your app for each platform\n\nEnsure that your app’s user interface and experience fit the needs of each platform by adding platform-specific views and features. For example, some Mac apps include a menu bar extra that appears even when the app isn’t the frontmost app. The following adds a `MenuBarExtra` instance only in the macOS version of a scene:\n\nFor design guidance, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/].\n\n### Prepare each platform for App Store submission\n\nBuild, run, and test your app on each platform before submitting each version to the App Store separately. Each submission involves a separate build and archival process.",
