  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWith Swift previews, you can make changes to your app’s views in code, and see the result of those changes quickly in the preview canvas. Add previews to your SwiftUI, UIKit, and AppKit views using the preview macro. Then configure how you want your previews to display using the preview canvas controls, or programmatically in code.\n\n### Add a preview macro to your interface file\n\nWhen you add views to your code, you can display them in the preview canvas. The preview canvas shows how your view appears on different devices in a variety of configurations.\n\n\n\nThe Swift preview macro is a snippet of code that makes and configures your view. You use one of the preview macros — such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Preview(_:body:)] — to tell Xcode what to display. To manually show or hide the preview canvas, select Editor > Canvas from the Xcode menu.\n\nTo add a preview macro to your view:\n\n### Generate previews using intelligence\n\nYou can use Xcode coding intelligence to generate a preview for you. In the source editor, select some view code and click the coding assistant icon that appears, or Control-click a symbol and choose Show Coding Tools > Show Coding Tools from the pop-up menu. In the coding tools popover that appears, click Generate a Preview.\n\nFor more information on coding intelligence features, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/writing-code-with-intelligence-in-xcode].\n\n### Interact with your view in live mode\n\nWhen you select the live or interactive preview option, your view appears and interacts just like it would on a device or simulator. Use live mode to test control logic, animations, and text entry as well as responses to asynchronous code. When you click the Live button at the bottom of the preview canvas, a single device preview appears in the canvas that you can interact with. This is the default mode for new previews that you add to your files.\n\n### Try out new designs quickly with selectable mode\n\nIn selectable mode, the preview displays a snapshot of your view so you can interact with your view’s UI elements in the canvas. To highlight the code for an element in the source editor, click the Selectable button at the bottom of the preview canvas, and double-click the element in the preview canvas. Xcode highlights both the element in the preview canvas and the corresponding code in the source editor. Then you can make code changes to the element in the source editor and see the results immediately in the preview canvas.\n\n\n\n### Control how your previews display with device settings\n\nUse Device settings to control how a preview displays for a specific device. For example, to see how your view looks in the dark appearance, in a landscape right orientation, with extra large text:\n\n\n\n### Test different view configurations\n\nUse variant mode to see how your view appears in different variations for a given configuration. For example, to test how well your view supports accessibility, select Variant mode from the bottom of the preview canvas, and select the Dynamic Type Variants option. Xcode displays your view with different sizes of text.\n\n\n\nPreview canvas supports the following variations:\n\n### Preview on a specific device\n\nTo see how your view displays on a specific device, choose the device from the Preview Device pop-up menu at the bottom of the preview canvas. When you do, Xcode displays a preview of your view on that device.\n\n\n\n### Capture specific previews in code\n\nIn addition to the preview options Xcode provides, you can also customize and configure previews you want to reuse programmatically.\n\nFor example, you can add a name to more easily track what each preview displays. When you pass the name of your preview as a string into the preview macro, the name appears in the title of the preview in the preview canvas.\n\nYou can also control how your preview displays by passing one or more configuration traits as a variadic argument list into the preview macro. For example, to display your view in the landscape left orientation, pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DeveloperToolsSupport\/PreviewTrait\/landscapeLeft] type property into the  [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DeveloperToolsSupport\/Preview\/init(_:traits:body:)-8pemr] preview initializer to tell Xcode which orientation to display.\n\n### Use inline dynamic properties with Previewable\n\nWhen a view depends on a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Binding] property wrapper, you can create a functional binding for that property and pass it into your preview using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Previewable()] macro. This macro works on any variable conforming to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DynamicProperty] protocol.\n\nTagging a dynamic property with the `Previewable` macro gets rid of the need to create wrapper views in previews.\n\n### Make complex objects reusable with a preview modifier\n\nTo avoid recreating expensive objects for every preview that needs them, in SwiftUI you can create these objects once with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PreviewModifier] and then pass the preview modifier into your preview using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Preview(_:traits:_:body:)] macro.\n\nExpensive objects — such as objects that make network calls, perform disk access, or just take considerable time and effort to setup — can make your previews take longer to load. By creating these expensive objects once, and sharing them across all your previews, you make your previews more efficient.\n\nFor example, if you have an app with an expensive [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Observation\/Observable()] object:\n\nYou reuse that expensive object across multiple views in your app:\n\nFor every view you want to preview, you recreate and pass in that expensive object:\n\nInstead, define the expensive object once and share it across multiple previews using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PreviewModifier] protocol.\n\n### Pass views only the data they need\n\nWhen creating views, pass in only the data the view needs to display. Avoid passing in objects that fetch data; objects make setting up a view’s preview more complicated and less performant.\n\nInstead, create views with the minimal amount of data they need, favoring simpler, immutable data types. Creating views this way makes testing and previewing your views easier and helps them perform better.\n\nThe following example shows how simple data types, like `String` and `enum`, can be used to preview a view in various ways using the preview macro.\n\n\n\n### Reduce your app size with development assets\n\nTo access resources in your previews, without shipping them in the final version of your app, use development assets. Development assets give you access to resources such as images, video, JSON data, and code files in your previews and Simulator, without increasing the overall size of your app.\n\nAdd items to the Development Assets of a project target as follows:",

Toggle Color Scheme on, and select Dark Appearance under Color Scheme.\n3. Toggle Orientation on, and select Landscape Right under Orientation.\n4. Toggle Dynamic Type on, and move the Dynamic Type slider to the X Large text setting.\n\n\n\n### Test different view configurations\n\nUse variant mode to see how your view appears in different variations for a given configuration.

This macro works on any variable conforming to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/DynamicProperty] protocol.\n\n```swift\nstruct PlayButton: View {\n    @Binding var isPlaying: Bool\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(action: {\n            self.isPlaying.toggle()\n        }) {\n            Image(systemName: isPlaying ? \"pause.circle\" : \"play.circle\")\n            .resizable()\n            .scaledToFit()\n            .frame(maxWidth: 80)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n#Preview {\n    \/\/ Tag the dynamic property with `Previewable`.\n    @Previewable @State var isPlaying = true\n\n    \/\/ Pass it into your view.\n    PlayButton(isPlaying: $isPlaying)\n}\n```\n\nTagging a dynamic property with the `Previewable` macro gets rid of the need to create wrapper views in previews.\n\n\n\n### Make complex objects reusable with a preview modifier\n\nTo avoid recreating expensive objects for every preview that needs them, in SwiftUI you can create these objects once with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PreviewModifier] and then pass the preview modifier into your preview using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Preview(_:traits:_:body:)] macro.\n\nExpensive objects — such as objects that make network calls, perform disk access, or just take considerable time and effort to setup — can make your previews take longer to load. By creating these expensive objects once, and sharing them across all your previews, you make your previews more efficient.\n\nFor example, if you have an app with an expensive [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Observation\/Observable()] object:\n\n```swift\n@Observable\nclass AppState {\n    \/\/ An expensive, complex, bulky object.\n    var expensiveObject = \"Some expensive object\"\n}\n\n@main\nstruct MyApp: App {\n    @State private var appState = AppState()\n\n    var body: some Scene {\n        WindowGroup {\n            ComplexView()\n                .environment(appState)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou reuse that expensive object across multiple views in your app:\n\n```swift\nstruct ComplexView: View {\n    @Environment(AppState.self) var appState\n\n    var body: some View {\n        Text(\"\\(appState.expensiveObject)\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor every view you want to preview, you recreate and pass in that expensive object:\n\n```swift\n#Preview {\n    ComplexView()\n        \/\/ Potentially expensive if `AppState` is large or complex.\n        .environment(AppState())\n}\n```\n\nInstead, define the expensive object once and share it across multiple previews using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PreviewModifier] protocol.\n\n1. Define a structure conforming to the `PreviewModifier` protocol.\n2. Implement the static [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PreviewModifier\/makeSharedContext()-4zi8r] function returning the object with the expensive state.\n3. Inject that shared context into the view you want to preview using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/PreviewModifier\/body(content:context:)] function.\n4. Add the modifier to the preview using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Preview(_:traits:_:body:)] macro.\n\n```swift\n\/\/ Create a struct conforming to the PreviewModifier protocol.\nstruct SampleData: PreviewModifier {\n\n    \/\/ Define the object to share and return it as a shared context.\n    static func makeSharedContext() async throws -> AppState {\n        let appState = AppState()\n        appState.expensiveObject = \"An expensive object to reuse in previews\"\n        return appState\n    }\n\n    func body(content: Content, context: AppState) -> some View {\n        \/\/ Inject the object into the view to preview.\n        content\n            .environment(context)\n    }\n}\n\n\/\/ Add the modifier to the preview.\n#Preview(traits: .modifier(SampleData())) {\n    ComplexView()\n}\n```\n\n### Pass views only the data they need\n\nWhen creating views, pass in only the data the view needs to display.
