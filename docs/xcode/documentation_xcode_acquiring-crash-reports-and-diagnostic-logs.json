If a customer reports an issue with your app, use the Crashes organizer in Xcode to get a report about the issue, as described in [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev675635e70] If the Crashes organizer doesn’t contain the diagnostic information you need or is unavailable to you, the customer can collect logs from their device and share them directly with you to resolve the issue. Once you have a crash report, you may need to add identifiable symbol information to the crash report—see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-identifiable-symbol-names-to-a-crash-report] for more information.\n\nFor issues that aren’t crashes, inspect the operating system’s console log to find important information for diagnosing the issue’s source.\n\n### Collect crash reports from TestFlight and the App Store\n\nTestFlight and the App Store collect crash reports for every submitted version of your app. Crash reports automatically contain identifiable symbol information if you include symbol information when submitting a build to the App Store. Review [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information] for the recommended settings.\n\nCrash reports from customers who send diagnostic and usage information are presented in the Crashes organizer, as described in [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/deve2819c518]. TestFlight users of your app automatically share crash reports with you, regardless of the device settings for sharing diagnostic and use data. If no crash reports appear in the Crashes organizer, see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev9a80ab71d] to enable collection of crash reports from your customers.\n\nThe following crash report types aren’t available through the Crashes organizer, but are available by other means.

You can view these logs using the Devices and Simulators window in Xcode, described in [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev7b20475ba].\n\nIf a customer reports a crash, they can transfer the crash report to either a Mac or Windows computer. See [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/xcode\/mac\/current\/#\/dev0f3181c2c].\n\n### Locate crash reports and memory logs on the device\n\nIf a customer reports a crash in your app and you don’t have a crash report for it in the Crashes organizer, ask the customer to e-mail you the crash report from their device.\n\nTo locate and email crash reports for iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS apps:\n\nTo locate and email crash reports for macOS and Mac Catalyst apps:\n\n### Create a crash report while debugging\n\nIf you encounter a crash while debugging your app using Xcode, the debugger intercepts the crash so you can inspect your app’s state. If you’d like to gather the full crash report for the issue, detach the debugger, either by using the Debug > Detach menu item in Xcode, or by issuing the `detach` command in the debugging console. This allows the app to finish crashing and lets the operating system generate the crash report.

Open the Analytics & Improvements section of Settings on the device. See [https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT202100].\n2. Tap Analytics Data.\n3. Locate the log for your app. The log name starts with `<AppBinaryName>_<DateTime>` for crash reports, or `JetsamEvent_<DateTime>` for high-memory use crashes.\n4. Select the desired log.\n5. Tap the Share icon, and select Mail to send the crash report as a mail attachment.\n\nTo locate and email crash reports for macOS and Mac Catalyst apps:\n\n1. Open the Console app, from Applications > Utilities in Finder.\n2. Select *Crash Reports*.\n3. Locate crash reports for your app in the list. Logs are listed by your app’s binary name.\n4. Right-click the desired log’s file name.\n5. Select Reveal in Finder.\n6. Drag the file displayed in Finder to Mail to send the crash report as a mail attachment.\n\n### Create a crash report while debugging\n\nIf you encounter a crash while debugging your app using Xcode, the debugger intercepts the crash so you can inspect your app’s state. If you’d like to gather the full crash report for the issue, detach the debugger, either by using the Debug > Detach menu item in Xcode, or by issuing the `detach` command in the debugging console.

For iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and visionOS issues, connect the device to your Mac. For watchOS issues, install the logging profile to the paired iPhone and then connect the iPhone to your Mac. See [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/bug-reporting\/profiles-and-logs\/?name=sysdiagnose&platform=watchos] to download the profile. For macOS issues, proceed to the next step.\n2. On the Mac, open the Console app, from Applications > Utilities in Finder.\n3. Select the device in the Console sidebar.\n4. Reproduce the issue and note the exact time.\n5. Look for logs that pertain to the issue from around the time you reproduced the issue.\n6. Use information from the log as clues to further guide your investigation of the issue.\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- **Adding identifiable symbol names to a crash report**: Replace hexadecimal addresses in a crash report with function names and line numbers that correspond to your app’s code.\n- **Identifying the cause of common crashes**: Find patterns in crash reports that identify common problems, and investigate the issue based on the pattern.\n- **Analyzing a crash report**: Identify clues in a crash report that help you diagnose problems.\n- **Identifying high-memory use with jetsam event reports**: Discover why the operating system terminated your app when available memory was low.\n\n",
