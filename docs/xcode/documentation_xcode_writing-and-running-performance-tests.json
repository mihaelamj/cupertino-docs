Use performance tests to record metrics on the performance critical parts of your code, and discover when the performance regresses below an acceptable baseline.\n\n### Create a test target\n\nPerformance tests use the same [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest] framework to validate code behavior. Create a test target in your Xcode project that you can add behavior and performance tests to. To learn how to add a new target to your project, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/configuring-a-new-target-in-your-project].\n\n### Add a test case class and performance test methods\n\nYou organize performance tests into test case classes, which are subclasses of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTestCase]. For information on creating test case classes and test methods, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/defining-test-cases-and-test-methods].\n\nA performance test method is a method on a test case class with a name that starts with `test`, no arguments, and no return value. The performance test calls one of the following methods to instruct XCTest to record metrics on your code’s performance:\n\n### Determine the performance metrics to record\n\nThe default behavior for [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTestCase\/measure(_:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTestCase\/measure(options:block:)] is to record the time spent in the measured code, in seconds. Change the default set of metrics collected by performance test methods in a test case class by overriding [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTestCase\/defaultPerformanceMetrics] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTestCase\/defaultMetrics]. Use a different measurement function from the list above to record different metrics in a specific test.\n\nFor information on the available metrics and on implementing your own metrics, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/XCTest\/XCTMetric].\n\n### Configure your scheme and test plan for accurate performance measurements\n\nXcode uses test plans you create in your Xcode project to determine which tests to run for a scheme, and how to configure the tests. To ensure that you’re gathering real-world behavior metrics for your app, configure the performance test plan so it replicates the conditions under which the code runs on device. Configure your scheme to build for testing using the Release build configuration, and turn off the “Debug executable” setting.\n\nConfigure your test plan to disable code coverage and the runtime sanitization options. For more information on configuring test plans, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/organizing-tests-to-improve-feedback].\n\n### Run your performance test method\n\nRun your performance tests in the same way that you run tests to verify code behavior, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/running-tests-and-interpreting-results]. In addition to the test outcome status icon in the source editor gutter next to the test method definition, Xcode shows an icon in the editor gutter next to any call to the performance measurement functions listed above. This icon is in one of the following states, depending on the outcome of the performance measurement:\n\nClick the performance measurement outcome icon to view a graph of the most recent values for the metrics recorded in the test, along with the average (mean) value for each metric recorded, as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\n### Set a baseline and tolerance\n\nDefine the threshold value for the recorded metrics in a performance test by setting a baseline value and maximum standard deviation. The test fails if the recorded metric is worse than the baseline value by more than the maximum standard deviation.\n\nTo set the baseline value for a performance test’s metric, follow these steps:\n\nYou can subsequently change the baseline value by doing the following:\n\n### Diagnose a failing performance test\n\nIf a test fails, you can find out more details about why the test failed by Control-clicking the icon in the editor gutter next to the failing test, and choosing “Profile [the test’s name]” to open the test in Instruments. Alternatively, navigate to the failing test in the Xcode test navigator, Control-click it, and choose “Profile [the test’s name]”.\n\nFor information on how performance tests fit into an overall life cycle of improving your app’s performance, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/improving-your-app-s-performance].",
