  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIn macOS 15 and later, app group containers offer [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/macos-release-notes\/macos-15-release-notes#System-Integrity-Protection] for your app’s local files even if the app doesn’t have the App Sandbox capability. These app group containers limit access by apps that aren’t in the app group. Apps not in the app group that attempt to access locations within an app group or app data container, result in a user prompt that requests their authorization.\n\nTo ensure your apps that use app groups also include System Integrity Protection, you need to confirm they have the correct entitlements and macOS can authorize those entitlements. For more information on adding an app group to an app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/configuring-app-groups].\n\nApps that can use app group containers include: main executables packaged in bundled structures, app extensions, App Clips, and XPC Services.\n\n## Add app group membership to your app\n\nEnsure that your app target lists all the app groups to which it belongs in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.security.application-groups]. You can use Xcode to entitle your app for app groups. For more details, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/configuring-app-groups].\n\nAn app can belong to more than one app group, with these guidelines:\n\n### Use provisioned app groups\n\nIf your app declares that it belongs to an app group that begins with `group.`, you need to include the group in your app’s provisioning profile.\n\nInclude all the restricted entitlements, including the app group entitlement, in the provisioning profile of the process; the values of these entitlements must match and account for any wildcards in the provisioning profile entitlements.\n\nProvisioning profiles for macOS apps that you previously created might not include authorization for the app group entitlement. You can check whether macOS set the entitlements validated flag on your process at runtime by running the command `sudo launchctl procinfo <pid>` in Terminal:\n\nXcode automatically obtains new provisioning profiles if you check “Automatically manage signing” in the Signing & Capabilities editor for your app target, and set the `REGISTER_APP_GROUPS` build setting to `Yes`. To apply a provisioning profile to a daemon, or another executable file that you don’t distribute in a bundle, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/signing-a-daemon-with-a-restricted-entitlement].\n\nIf you encounter any issues provisioning the app group entitlement properly, see  [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/diagnosing-issues-with-entitlements] for help diagnosing these issues.\n\n### Use app groups that you don’t provision\n\nTo use app groups that have the `<Developer team identifier>.<group name>` identifiers on macOS, you don’t need a provisioning profile. The system checks that the team identifier prefix matches the developer team identifier you use to sign the app. You also don’t need to register these app group identifiers on the Developer website. But, there are limitations to using these identifiers:\n\n## Access an app group container\n\nWhen your app becomes a member of an app group, use FileManager APIs to get the path to the shared container.
