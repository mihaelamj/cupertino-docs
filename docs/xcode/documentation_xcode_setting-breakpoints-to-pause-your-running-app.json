  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen you identify a place in your source code where you want to investigate a bug, set a breakpoint to pause the debugger so you can inspect your variables and step through your code to isolate the bug.\n\nTo locate crashes or other bugs where it is difficult to know where to set a breakpoint, use symbolic or issue breakpoints to pause on specific problem conditions and quickly identify where a bug occurs.\n\nFor bugs that occur after several iterations or only under certain circumstances, specify conditions on your breakpoint. If you want to log information at specific points in your app or receive notifications when a line of code executes, use breakpoint actions.\n\n### Specify where to pause your app\n\nNavigate to a line in your code where you want execution to pause, then click the gutter or line number in the source editor to set a breakpoint. Xcode displays a breakpoint icon to indicate the location.\n\n\n\nDrag a breakpoint up or down to move it to another location; drag it away from the gutter to remove it. Click the breakpoint icon in the debug area toolbar to activate or deactivate all breakpoints.\n\n### Manage breakpoints across your app\n\nWhen you have many breakpoints set across several source code files, click the Breakpoint Navigator button in the navigator area of the main window to open the Breakpoint navigator to view and manage all breakpoints.\n\n\n\nClick a breakpoint label in the Breakpoint navigator to quickly navigate to the breakpoint in the source editor. Pressing the Delete key after selecting a breakpoint label deletes the breakpoint from your code. Click a breakpoint icon in the Breakpoint navigator to enable or disable it.\n\nTo easily find a frequently used breakpoint in the navigator, Control-click the breakpoint label, choose Edit Breakpoint, and enter a name for it. Then use the filter at the bottom of the Breakpoint navigator.\n\nYou can also use the filter to find breakpoints by symbols in the line of code for the breakpoint. The filter tools provide options for showing only modified breakpoints and showing only enabled breakpoints.\n\n### Specify conditions for pausing your app\n\nFor bugs that occur after a certain number of iterations, or under limited conditions that require repetitive actions, it’s cumbersome to pause at the breakpoint and press the Continue button repeatedly until the bug occurs. There are two approaches to handle this type of situation more efficiently in the debugger.\n\nFor a bug that occurs after a certain number of iterations, set the debugger to ignore the breakpoint for some iterations. Control-click the breakpoint, choose Edit Breakpoint, and specify the number of times to ignore the breakpoint before stopping.\n\n\n\nFor a bug that occurs under limited conditions, set the debugger to pause on a breakpoint when an expression is true. Control-click the breakpoint, choose Edit Breakpoint, and enter a condition using variables available in the local scope.\n\n\n\nThe debugger evaluates the expression each time it reaches the breakpoint in execution, and pauses only if the expression is true.\n\n### Pause on a symbol outside your code\n\nTo debug some issues, you need to pause on a symbol that your source code doesn’t define. For example, when you encounter an Auto Layout issue, the error message recommends setting a breakpoint on `UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints`. To do that, use a symbolic breakpoint.\n\nIn the Breakpoint navigator, click the Add button (+) in the lower-left corner, and choose Symbolic Breakpoint. Enter the object and symbol in the Symbol field, using the format of the example text.\n\n\n\nThe debugger pauses when the app or your code calls the symbol you specify. The example symbol `UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints` typically pauses in the application’s `main` method and not on a line in your code. When this happens, use the console to view an Auto Layout trace with `po [[UIWindow keyWindow] _autolayoutTrace]`.\n\n### Pause on an uncaught Swift error or Objective-C exception\n\nWhen your app encounters an unhandled Swift Error or Objective-C exception, it crashes. Frequently, the stack trace doesn’t point directly to where the problem occurs. Set a breakpoint to pause on an uncaught Swift Error or Objective-C exception so you can locate the problem.\n\nWhen an unhandled Swift error causes a crash, the debugger shows a fatal error on the line with the `try!` and not where the error originally occurs.\n\n\n\nIf the thrown error has a helpful error message, that may be enough information to resolve the problem. If not, add a Swift error breakpoint to pause on the line that throws the error. In the Breakpoint navigator, click the Add button (+) in the lower-left corner, and choose Swift Error Breakpoint. The app then pauses on the thrown error instead of the `try!`.\n\n\n\nWhen an uncaught Objective-C error causes a crash, the debugger shows the crash in the `AppDelegate` or `main` method.\n\n\n\nAdd an Objective-C exception breakpoint to pause on the line where the crash occurs instead of `main`. In the Breakpoint navigator, click the Add button (+) in the lower-left corner, and choose Exception Breakpoint.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/identifying-the-cause-of-common-crashes].\n\n### Pause automatically when the system detects a runtime issue\n\nXcode has tools called *sanitizers* to detect several different types of runtime issues: updating the user interface outside the main thread, updating variables from different threads unsafely, accessing addresses unsafely, and executing code that results in undefined behavior. Configure your scheme to enable sanitizers to detect these issues with static analysis at build time. When you disable the sanitizers and your app encounters one of these issues, your app crashes and Xcode may not clearly identify where the issue occurs.\n\n\n\nTo pause your app and investigate, click the Add button (+) in the lower-left corner of the Breakpoint navigator,  choose Runtime Issue Breakpoint, and select the type of runtime issue for the breakpoint.\n\n\n\nEnable the sanitizer for the issue and run your app. The sanitizer identifies lines of code where it expects runtime issues to occur. When the app pauses at your runtime breakpoint, investigate why the issue occurs. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/diagnosing-memory-thread-and-crash-issues-early].\n\n### Log variable values, run scripts, or play sounds at a breakpoint\n\nInstead of writing code to log variable values and details about your app’s execution, use breakpoint actions to log messages and to perform debugger commands that print variable values to the console.\n\nBreakpoint actions can also play sounds when the debugger reaches a breakpoint, which is useful for knowing when code executes without pausing. Breakpoint actions can execute AppleScripts or shell scripts to perform helpful debugging tasks like taking a screenshot or saving some app data for analysis.\n\nTo perform an action with a breakpoint, Control-click the breakpoint, either in the source editor or in the Breakpoint navigator, choose Edit Breakpoint, click Add Action, choose an action and provide any additional information necessary. For example, provide a message for the Log Message action, or a command and parameters for the Debugger Command action.\n\n\n\nTo perform more than one action at a breakpoint, click the Add button (+) to the right of an existing action to add another action. To continue executing your app without pausing after performing your action, select the “Automatically continue after evaluating actions” option.",
