Unpair the remote or controller if it is already paired with another device.\n2. Turn off the remote or controller.\n3. On the Mac, open Bluetooth in System Settings.\n4. In Bluetooth settings, turn Bluetooth on.\n5. Turn on the remote or controller.\n6. In Bluetooth settings, wait for the remote to appear in the Devices list.\n7. Click the Pair button next to the device to pair it with the Mac.\n\nSome remotes and controllers don’t appear in Bluetooth settings unless you put them into pairing mode.
