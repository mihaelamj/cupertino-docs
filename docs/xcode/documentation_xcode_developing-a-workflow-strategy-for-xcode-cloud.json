After Xcode Cloud successfully completes the first build, review how you can best create custom Xcode Cloud workflows to practice continuous integration and delivery (CI\/CD). Then, plan next steps for refining your CI\/CD practice to make sure your app or framework is always in a releasable state.\n\n\n\nIf you’re new to CI\/CD, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/About-Continuous-Integration-and-Delivery-with-Xcode-Cloud] to learn how CI\/CD with Xcode Cloud helps you create high-quality apps and frameworks.

For example, consider a solo developer who works on an iOS app. They can create a workflow that builds their app and runs unit tests for every change to a branch. Additionally, they might create a second workflow that runs tests on other Apple devices in Simulator, archives the app, and distributes a new version to testers with [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/testflight\/] each time they create a new Git tag.\n\nIn contrast, consider a team in a corporate context that develops an app that’s available on all Apple platforms. The team might create several workflows that:\n\nAlthough there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to CI\/CD, following these steps to adopt CI\/CD over time is a good strategy to consider:\n\n### Edit and create workflows\n\nBy adopting CI\/CD, managing Xcode Cloud workflows becomes part of your day-to-day app development. To help you stay focused and make using Xcode Cloud convenient, edit your Xcode Cloud workflows with Xcode.\n\nTo update an existing workflow in Xcode:\n\nAlternatively, Control-click a workflow in the Report navigator and choose Edit Workflow.\n\nTo create a workflow in Xcode, choose Integrate > Create Workflow.\n\n### Deactivate a workflow instead of deleting it\n\nEventually, you might want to stop using a certain workflow. One way to do this is to delete the workflow in the Manage Workflows sheet. However, deleting a workflow permanently deletes its build history and artifacts.

Instead of deleting a workflow, deactivate it to preserve its build history and artifacts.\n\nTo deactivate a workflow:\n\nAlternatively, deactivate a workflow by Control-clicking it in the Manage Workflows sheet and choosing Deactivate, or by deactivating it in the Xcode Cloud tab on the App Store Connect website.\n\nTo start using a deactivated workflow again, reactivate it any time in the Manage Workflows sheet, or open the workflow and toggle the switch next to its name to the On position.\n\n\n\n### Duplicate a workflow before making significant changes\n\nWhen you edit a workflow, a change might unintentionally cause the next build to fail.

The team might create several workflows that:\n\n- Build various projects in a workspace and run unit tests on one simulated device per platform\n- Perform additional, long-running tests once a week\n- Automatically distribute nightly builds to members of the development team\n- Distribute new versions to the QA team every two weeks\n\nAlthough there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to CI\/CD, following these steps to adopt CI\/CD over time is a good strategy to consider:\n\n1. Identify what a comprehensive CI\/CD practice looks like for you. For example, list all verifications you want Xcode Cloud to perform.\n2. Translate your comprehensive CI\/CD practice into Xcode Cloud workflows. For example, if you want to distribute a new version of your app to testers every week, that task can translate to one workflow.\n3. Plan the necessary work as individual tasks and work on each workflow one by one until you have a comprehensive CI\/CD practice in place.\n\n### Edit and create workflows\n\nBy adopting CI\/CD, managing Xcode Cloud workflows becomes part of your day-to-day app development. To help you stay focused and make using Xcode Cloud convenient, edit your Xcode Cloud workflows with Xcode.\n\nTo update an existing workflow in Xcode:\n\n1. Choose Integrate > Manage Workflows to open the Manage Workflows sheet.\n2. Double-click to open the existing workflow.\n\nAlternatively, Control-click a workflow in the Report navigator and choose Edit Workflow.\n\nTo create a workflow in Xcode, choose Integrate > Create Workflow.\n\n### Deactivate a workflow instead of deleting it\n\nEventually, you might want to stop using a certain workflow.

Instead of deleting a workflow, deactivate it to preserve its build history and artifacts.\n\nTo deactivate a workflow:\n\n1. Control-click the workflow in the Report navigator and choose Edit Workflow.\n2. Toggle the switch next to the workflow’s name in the top-left corner of the sheet to the Off position and save your changes.\n\nAlternatively, deactivate a workflow by Control-clicking it in the Manage Workflows sheet and choosing Deactivate, or by deactivating it in the Xcode Cloud tab on the App Store Connect website.\n\nTo start using a deactivated workflow again, reactivate it any time in the Manage Workflows sheet, or open the workflow and toggle the switch next to its name to the On position.\n\n\n\n### Duplicate a workflow before making significant changes\n\nWhen you edit a workflow, a change might unintentionally cause the next build to fail.

Open your project or workspace in Xcode, and then choose Integrate > Manage Workflows to open the Manage Workflows sheet.\n2. Control-click the workflow you want to change and choose Duplicate to open a copy.\n3. Rename the copy to make sure you can distinguish it from the original.\n4. Save the duplicated workflow.\n\n\n\n### Restrict who can edit a workflow\n\nDepending on the complexity of your project, creating a workflow and making sure Xcode Cloud can successfully build your project can take a significant amount of time. To prevent team members from making unintentional changes to a workflow, restrict who can edit it using these steps:\n\n1. Open the workflow in Xcode or on the [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com] website.\n2. Navigate to the General section, and select the Restrict Editing checkbox.\n\nAs a result, only members of your team with the Admin or App Manager role can make changes to that workflow.\n\n\n\n### Manage workflows in App Store Connect\n\nIn some cases — especially for large teams and in a corporate context — a team member may be more familiar with [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com]. To address use cases like this, you can create and edit workflows in App Store Connect after you configure your Xcode project or workspace to use Xcode Cloud.\n\nTo manage workflows in App Store Connect:\n\n1. Open your app’s page and click the Xcode Cloud tab.\n2. Click Manage Workflows in the sidebar to display a list of your workflows.\n3. Click the More Options button (…) next to a workflow and choose the action you want to perform. For example, choose Edit to make changes to a workflow.\n\n## Workflows\n\n- **Xcode Cloud workflow reference**: Configure metadata, start conditions, actions, post-actions, and more to create custom Xcode Cloud workflows.\n- **Creating a workflow that builds your app for distribution**: Configure a workflow to build and sign your app for distribution to testers with TestFlight, in the App Store, or as a notarized app.\n\n",
