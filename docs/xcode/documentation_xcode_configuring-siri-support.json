  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo process user requests that originate from Siri, first add the Siri capability to your app’s target. This informs the system that your app is ready to resolve, confirm, and handle SiriKit intents, typically through its Intents extension; in iOS 14 and later, you can choose to perform each of these steps from within your app.\n\nAfter you configure your app to process SiriKit intents, add code — to your app delegate or your Intents extension — to route incoming intents to your custom handlers. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SiriKit\/dispatching-intents-to-handlers].\n\n### Add the Siri capability to your target\n\nFollow the steps in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability] to add the capability to your app’s target, making sure you select the Siri capability from Xcode’s Capabilities library. For watchOS apps with separate WatchKit extensions, you must add the capability to the WatchKit Extension target. The capability isn’t available for macOS.\n\n\n\nAfter you add the Siri capability, Xcode automatically updates the entitlements file of your target to include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.siri]. The App Store requires this entitlement for any app that contains an Intents extension that handles non-shortcut Siri requests.\n\n### Handle SiriKit intents in an Intents extension\n\nUse an Intents extension to respond to the user’s request from Siri quickly and without incurring the performance cost of loading the entire app into memory. To use an extension, you must first complete a number of additional configuration steps, such as adding one or more Intents extensions to your app’s target and specifying the types of intents those extensions support. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/sirikit\/intent_handling_infrastructure\/creating_an_intents_app_extension#2864127].\n\n### Handle SiriKit intents directly in your app\n\nIn iOS 14 and later, you can choose not to use an Intents extension, and instead respond to the user’s request directly from within your iOS app. To do this, override the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:handlerFor:)] method in your app delegate and use it to map incoming intents to the objects that are capable of handling them.\n\nIn the same way you configure an Intents extension, you must specify the types of intents that your iOS app supports.
