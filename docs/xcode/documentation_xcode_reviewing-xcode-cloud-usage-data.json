Depending on the subscription plan you choose, you have a certain amount of Xcode Cloud usage at your disposal. This makes it important to review your Xcode Cloud usage for yourself and your team.\n\nTo learn more about available Xcode Cloud subscription plans, see [http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/xcode-cloud\/get-started].\n\n### Access usage information and purchase subscription plans in the Apple Developer app\n\nThe Apple Developer app allows you to access Xcode Cloud usage information for your team and offers functionality to purchase additional usage time. To view your team’s usage, go to Account, then navigate to the Xcode Cloud section. If you have the Account Holder role and your team uses Xcode Cloud, use the app to purchase a subscription plan that offers additional Xcode Cloud usage time.\n\n### Access more detailed usage data in App Store Connect\n\nApp Store Connect allows you to access Xcode Cloud usage information. It shows usage trends and allows you to access detailed usage information for your team and each individual app — for example, the number of created builds and the build duration. Additionally, export usage information as a `.csv` file — for example, to create custom reports.\n\nAfter logging into [https:\/\/appstoreconnect.apple.com]:\n\nThe following screenshot shows the usage dashboard for the Food Truck sample code app from [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/food-truck-building-a-swiftui-multiplatform-app]. It displays the number of builds and the usage for 30 days — including trends.\n\n",
