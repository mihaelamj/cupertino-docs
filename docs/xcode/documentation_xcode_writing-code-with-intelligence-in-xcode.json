  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe coding intelligence features in Xcode help you write code, navigate unfamiliar codebases, find opportunities for new features, fix or refactor existing code, and generate documentation along the way.\n\n\n\nYou interact with a large language model of your choice using natural language prompts to ask questions and give instructions. The model refines the responses to your prompts based on your previous interactions and project context. You stay in control over changes to your project by applying suggestions automatically or reviewing and applying them selectively yourself. Xcode maintains a history of your conversations with the model so that you can review past responses, track changes, and return to any previous state of your project.\n\n### Set up coding intelligence\n\nTo use coding intelligence, first choose a model and other options, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/setting-up-coding-intelligence].\n\n### Display the coding assistant\n\nIn the upper-left corner of the toolbar, click the button to the right of the navigator button to open the coding assistant area in the sidebar or press Command-0. Here, you can enter prompts, see responses, start and navigate between conversations, rollback changes, and more.\n\n\n\nIf a Set Up Intelligence button appears in the sidebar instead, click the button and enable a coding intelligence model in Xcode > Settings > Intelligence.\n\n### Explore unfamiliar code\n\nAt any time, you can ask Xcode to explain code and find files to implement a new feature or just to familiarize yourself with some code. For example, if you download the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Landmarks-Building-an-app-with-Liquid-Glass] sample app, you can select code and ask questions, such as:\n\n\n\nXcode responds under your prompt in the conversation area of the coding assistant. The response may contain content that you can interact with. For example, if the response references a filename, click the arrow button next to the filename to open it in the source editor. To continue the conversation with the coding assistant, enter follow-up prompts, like:\n\nWhen you enter another prompt, the coding assistant appends your prompt and response to the conversation. Xcode maintains an entire transcript of your interactions with the model so you can refer back to them.\n\n### Learn about symbols and code\n\nIn the source editor, Control-click a symbol or code selection and press Command-Option-0 or choose Show Coding Tools > Show Coding Tools from the contextual menu. Then click Explain, or enter a more specific prompt in the coding tools popover. The coding assistant displays the prompt and its response in the conversation area.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, click the coding assistant button in the source editor gutter to display the coding tools popover.\n\n### Generate or modify code\n\nGive Xcode specific instructions on how to generate or modify code. If you aren’t getting the result you expected, try breaking down your question or adding more detailed instruction. Between each prompt, review and validate the code changes with a preview or playground, and continue iterating on your app by adjusting your prompts to get the behavior you’re looking for.\n\nFor example, if you’re new to Swift and SwiftUI, you can code along with the modifications that Xcode makes. Start with a Swift app that you create from a template and instruct Xcode to make incremental changes, such as:\n\nWhile working on a response, Xcode displays progress messages in the message text field before posting its response in the conversation area. The response may contain a description of the changes, including some steps or code changes.\n\n\n\nThe changes may go beyond what you asked for or build on your previous prompts. The response may contain next steps and ask you a follow-up question. Xcode puts you in control, where you lead and redirect the conversation as needed to steer the model in the direction you’d like to go.\n\nYou can either answer the question (continue the conversation with the assistant) or enter a new prompt.\n\nTo generate code about specific symbols while in the source editor, you can use the coding tools popover. Control-click a symbol and choose Show Coding Tools > Show Coding Tools from the contextual menu, then enter a prompt in the coding tools popover.\n\n### Apply changes to your code\n\nYou can see code changes that Xcode automatically applies to your files as file *snippets* in the conversation. These snippets show the modified or added file, and clicking on them takes you to that specific change in the source editor.\n\nIf you want Xcode to automatically edit your code, turn on Automatically Apply Changes by clicking the button at the lower-right corner of the sidebar. The response may contain content that you can interact with. For example, click a code listing to open changes in the source editor. Xcode uses multicolor change bars to highlight the lines of code that it changes using coding intelligence.\n\nTo undo changes, click Revert above the message text field. To reapply the changes, click Reapply. Alternatively, click the History button in the upper-right corner of the sidebar, to see a history of changes and roll them back by prompt (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/writing-code-with-intelligence-in-xcode#Rollback-changes-using-the-conversation-history]).\n\nIf you turn the automatically apply button off, Xcode proposes changes to your code instead of applying them and labels them as “Proposed Changes” in the conversation. The response may describe the code changes that the assistant suggests and contain proposed code that you can selectively apply or paste into your files. To apply a proposed change, click the code in the response and click Apply. To apply all the suggested changes, click the Apply button above the message text field.\n\n\n\n### Customize the context of your prompts\n\nBy default, Xcode automatically gathers relevant context to send to the model, based on your prompt and the conversation history. In addition to the automatic context, you can reference specific symbols and files, upload attachments, or refer to a selection in the source editor by mentioning it in your prompt.\n\nYou can add specific references to symbols and files by typing the `@` character and choosing a symbol or file:\n\n\n\nTo add additional files from outside your project, choose “Upload files” from the Attachments pop-up menu in the lower-left corner, under the message text field, and select the files to upload from the dialog.\n\nThe Project Context button in the lower-right corner of the sidebar is on by default. This allows Xcode to share relevant code and other context from your project with the model. To see the files and search terms that Xcode used, click the information icon next to Project Context if it appears in the response. To narrow the scope of the project files, turn off the automatic search feature and add explicit references to files and symbols in your prompt.\n\n\n\n### Generate playgrounds and previews\n\nPlaygrounds and previews are a great way to experiment with new code without modifying your app. Use playgrounds to run and display code snippets in the canvas, and use previews to validate UI code across platforms. Xcode generates playground and preview code that may contain sample data to help you better understand and visualize the code in the canvas.\n\nTo add a playground macro to your project, open coding tools and choose Generate a Playground:\n\n\n\nXcode shows the results of the playground, and for SwiftUI files, the previews, in the canvas area. If the canvas isn’t open, choose Editor > Canvas to show it, then click Resume.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the playground macro, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/running-code-snippets-using-the-playground-macro]. For previews, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/previewing-your-apps-interface-in-xcode].\n\n### Fix your code\n\nIf you encounter a compilation warning or error while building your app, Xcode may be able to generate a fix for you.\n\nThe source editor highlights any issues with a red underline and presents an issue summary and icon. Click the icon to show more information about the issue, then click Generate next to “Generate Fix for Issue”. Xcode applies the model-generated change and shows the fix in the coding assistant.\n\n\n\n### Generate documentation\n\nLet Xcode draft your API documentation for you. Select a symbol in the source editor and click the coding intelligence icon that appears. In the dialog, click Document.\n\n\n\nXcode can add [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DocC]-style comments to the source file above the symbol. For example, select a class and Xcode adds documentation for the class, its properties and methods, including the method parameters.\n\nXcode displays coding intelligence controls at the bottom of the source editor that summarizes the change. To see the response in the conversation area of the coding assistant, click the coding assistant button. To undo changes, click the Revert button.\n\n\n\n### Browse previous conversations\n\nAt any time you can review the conversations you have with the coding assistant. A conversation is a thread of prompts and responses that appears in the conversation area. For example, you can ask the model to make a series of changes for a feature you’re working on in the same conversation. Then create a new conversation for another feature that’s in a different part of your code.\n\nYou can manage your conversations in the conversation area or using the Conversation pop-up menu in the toolbar to:\n\n\n\n### Rollback changes using the conversation history\n\nUse the conversation history that Xcode maintains to rollback changes to a known state of your project, or to review changes across multiple files in your project.\n\nTo rollback changes in a conversation by prompt, choose the conversation from the Conversation pop-up menu and click the History button. Xcode shows a chronological list of your prompts with a slider on the right. Move the slider from the bottom to the top to unwind changes in the order that you made them. Move the slider up to remove changes, that Xcode shows on the right, and move the slider down to restore changes in the next prompt.\n\n\n\nXcode retains all the edits it made after that state in case you decide to roll forward any changes later. After scrubbing back to the point you would like to restore to, click the Restore button to update your project files to the state from this point on. To keep all the changes in a conversation regardless of the current slider position, click Cancel.",
