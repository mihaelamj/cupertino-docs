  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nEnable the Media Device Discovery capability in an iOS app extension to indicate its intent to search the local network or paired Bluetooth devices for a third-party media receiver. This capability corresponds to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.media-device-discovery-extension] entitlement. When you enable Media Device Discovery, Xcode adds the entitlement to a code-signing entitlements file for the extension’s target.\n\nAt run-time, when a user invokes a UI to play media, the app presents an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVRoutePickerView] to offer possible devices for the user to stream to. The system searches your app’s bundle for extensions with this entitlement to check whether your app provides such a device. If so, the system adds the third-party device next to any available AirPlay devices in the picker, which provides the user with a unified media streaming experience.\n\n## Add the Media Device Discovery capability to your target\n\nTo add the capability, follow the steps in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app#Add-a-capability] section of [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app] for your extension’s target. If you add a new target in your Xcode project using the Media Device Discovery template, Xcode enables this capability automatically.\n\n\n\n## Code the extension\n\nYou code the extension to search the local network or paired Bluetooth devices for a specific media receiver using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DeviceDiscoveryExtension] framework. If the search succeeds, the extension passes the discovered device to the system. For an example app that demonstrates media device discovery, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DeviceDiscoveryExtension\/discovering-a-third-party-media-streaming-device].",
