  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTo begin writing code quickly, create an Xcode project from a template that contains the essential project configuration and files for the platform and type of app you want to create. For example, select a template and options for developing a multiplatform SwiftUI app, macOS command-line tool, iOS augmented reality app, or visionOS immersive environment app.\n\n### Prepare configuration information\n\nBefore you create a project, collect the information that Xcode needs to identify your app and you as a developer:\n\n### Create a project\n\nLaunch Xcode, then click Create New Project in the Xcode window or choose File > New > Project. In the sheet that appears, select a specific platform or Multiplatform for an app that runs on all platforms. Then select a template under Application depending on the platform you select.\n\n\n\nIf you see a banner that says you don’t have support for a platform, you can create the project, but you can’t build and run it on a device. To install the platform now, click the Get button on the right of the banner. Otherwise, you can manage downloads in the Components settings later (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/downloading-and-installing-additional-xcode-components]).\n\nIn the following sheet, enter a *product name* and *organization identifier* that Xcode uses to create the *bundle identifier* that identifies your app throughout the system. Optionally, choose an account from the Team pop-up menu that Xcode uses to code sign your app.\n\n\n\nIn the sheets that appear, choose other options from pop-up menus depending on the template you select, such as testing systems, storage, interface, and language. In the last sheet, choose a location for your project, select other options, and click Create.\n\n### Manage files in the main window\n\nWhen you create a project or open an existing project, the *main window* appears, showing the necessary files and resources for developing your app.\n\nYou can access different parts of your project from the *navigator area* on the left. Use the *Project navigator* to select files you want to edit in the *editor area*. For example, when you select a Swift file in the Project navigator, the file opens in the *source editor,* where you can modify the code and set breakpoints.\n\n\n\nDetails about the selected file also appear in the *inspector area* on the right. In the inspector area, you can select the File inspector to edit properties of a file. If you want to hide the inspector to make more room for the editor, click the “Hide or show the Inspectors” button in the upper-right corner of the toolbar.\n\nYou use the *toolbar* to build and run your app on a simulated or real device. For iOS apps, choose the app target and a simulator or connected device from the run destination menu in the toolbar, then click the Run button. For macOS apps, just click the Run button.\n\nWhen your app launches, the *debug area* opens, where you can control the execution of your app and inspect variables. When the app stops at the breakpoint, use the controls in the debug area to step through the code or continue execution. When you are done running the app, click the Stop button in the toolbar.\n\nIf you use SwiftUI, you can see an interactive preview of the user interface while you create your app. Xcode keeps the changes you make in the source file, the canvas on the right, and the inspector in sync. You can use the controls in the preview to run the app with the debugger, too. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.Xcode\/documentation\/Xcode\/creating-your-app-s-interface-with-swiftui].\n\nTo change properties you enter when creating your project, select the project name in the Project navigator that appears at the top, then the *project editor* opens in the editor area. Most of the properties you entered appear on the *General pane* of the project editor.\n\n",

For example, select a template and options for developing a multiplatform SwiftUI app, macOS command-line tool, iOS augmented reality app, or visionOS immersive environment app.\n\n### Prepare configuration information\n\nBefore you create a project, collect the information that Xcode needs to identify your app and you as a developer:\n\n- **Product name.** The name of your app as you want it to appear in the App Store and on a device when a person installs it. Choose a product name that has a minimum length of 2 and no more than 30 characters, and is similar to the app name that you enter later in App Store Connect. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/app-store-connect\/reference\/app-information] in App Store Connect Help.\n- **Team.** The email or phone number for the Apple account that you want to use as a developer if you haven’t already added it to Xcode > Settings > Apple Accounts.\n- **Organization identifier.** A reverse DNS string that uniquely identifies your organization. If you don’t have a company identifier, use `com.example.` followed by your organization name, and replace it before you distribute your app.\n\n\n\n### Create a project\n\nLaunch Xcode, then click Create New Project in the Xcode window or choose File > New > Project. In the sheet that appears, select a specific platform or Multiplatform for an app that runs on all platforms.
