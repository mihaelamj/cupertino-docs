You can open and edit this file in Xcode, or use any third-party tool that supports this file type. Xcode manages the localizable strings in your app for you as follows:\n\n- Extracts strings from the following file types: source code, storyboard, XIB, `.strings`, `.stringsdict`, and Siri intent definition. Adds the extracted strings to a standard XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) that’s familiar to localizers.\n- Adds the correct `.stringsdict` plural variants for each exported language to the XLIFF file.\n- Creates a strings file for the localizable properties in the information property list file.\n- Copies all localizable resources into the `Source Contents` folder to provide context for localizers.\n\nXcode extracts strings that you pass to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Text] structures, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSLocalizedString] macro, and similar APIs in your code. For example, if you pass a string with a comment to the `NSLocalizedString` macro, Xcode includes the comment in the XLIFF file.\n\nIn addition, each localization folder in the catalog contains only the resources and assets that you mark as localizable.
