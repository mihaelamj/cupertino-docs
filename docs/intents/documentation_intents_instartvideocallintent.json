  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe system creates `INStartVideoCallIntent` objects to let you know when the user wants to place a video call using your app. A video call intent object contains the users to include in the call. It’s up to you to match the information in this object to contacts in your app and to initiate the resulting call.\n\nYour Intents extension receives this intent when the user tries to initiate a call from the Siri interface. If your app supports CallKit, you may also receive this intent when the user tries to initiate a call from system interfaces such as the Recents tab of the Phone app.\n\nTo handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INStartVideoCallIntentHandling] protocol. Your handler confirms the request and creates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INStartVideoCallIntentResponse] object to indicate that it’s possible to begin the call. Don’t try to initiate calls directly from your Intents extension. SiriKit launches your app and passes it an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] object that your app must then use to initiate the call. SiriKit places an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction] object in the user activity object with this intent. For calls initiated through Siri, the interaction object also includes the response provided by your Intents extension.\n\nFor a list of other intents in the VoIP calling domain, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INCallsDomainHandling].\n\n### Additional Intent Attributes\n\nThe following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:\n\nApps can optionally ask the user to unlock the device before handling this intent. To require unlocking of the device, include the name of this class in the `IntentsRestrictedWhileLocked` key of your Intents extension’s `Info.plist` file.\n\n### Example Phrases\n\nThere are many ways in which users can ask Siri to place a video call. The table below provides a few sample phrases in different languages. You can use these phrases during testing to trigger your intents. This list isn’t exhaustive and Siri may recognize many other phrases.\n\nIn the preceding examples, `<appName>` represents the name of the app whose Intents extension initiates the call. If your app uses custom names for contacts, you can tell Siri about those names using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INVocabulary] class.",
