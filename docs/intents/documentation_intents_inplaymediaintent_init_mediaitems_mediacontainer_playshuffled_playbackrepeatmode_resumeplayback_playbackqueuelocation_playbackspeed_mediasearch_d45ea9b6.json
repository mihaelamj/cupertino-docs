When donating the intent, the system uses only the first item in the array, ignoring the other media items in the array.\n- **mediaContainer**: The container of the media item. For example, when the user plays a song from the playlist, the playlist is the container. A television show with multiple episodes is another example. However, some media items, like movies, may have no container.\n- **playShuffled**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the media plays in a shuffled order.\n- **playbackRepeatMode**: The repeat mode setting at the time the user plays the media item.\n- **resumePlayback**: The resume playback setting at the time the user plays the media item. Set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] when the user hasn’t finished listening to or watching the media item.\n- **playbackQueueLocation**: The location in the queue to play the media item.\n- **playbackSpeed**: The speed to play the media item.\n- **mediaSearch**: The search parameters for a media item.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPlayMediaIntent] object should include information about the media that accurately represents the content. For example, if the user plays a song from a particular album, include both pieces of information in the intent. Provide the song in `mediaItems` and the album in `mediaContainer`. If your app supports options for shuffle play, repeat modes, and resuming playback, include the current settings for those options when creating the intent.\n\n",
