When configuring your response object, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRequestRideIntentResponse\/rideStatus] property to specify an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideStatus] object with the details of the ride. A ride status object contains information about the vehicle and driver that are picking up the user’s party, the pickup and drop-off locations, the price of the ride, and whether the booking request was successful.
