  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAutomotive venders can add support for this intent to an Intents extension that they ship with their automotive apps. When the user asks Siri to change the audio source of the vehicle, SiriKit creates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetAudioSourceInCarIntent] object and delivers it to your app’s Intents extension. You use the intent to identify which audio source the user wants to use and to communicate the new audio source information directly to your vehicle’s systems.\n\nUsers may select audio sources by name or by asking for the next or previous audio source that’s available. When the user asks for an audio source by name, Siri populates the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetAudioSourceInCarIntent\/audioSource] property of this intent object with the specific requested source. When the user asks for the next or previous audio source, Siri places the appropriate value in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetAudioSourceInCarIntent\/relativeAudioSourceReference] property so that you can determine which audio source to select. Only one of these properties contains usable information; Siri sets the other to a constant indicating an unknown status for the value.\n\nThe object that handles this intent must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetAudioSourceInCarIntentHandling] protocol. Use this intent object to resolve the audio source details and to create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetAudioSourceInCarIntentResponse] object indicating the results of changing the audio source.\n\n### Additional Intent Attributes\n\nThe following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:\n\n### Example Phrases\n\nUsers can ask Siri to change the audio source in a vehicle in a variety of ways. The table below provides a few sample phrases in different languages. You can use these phrases during testing to trigger your intents. This list isn’t exhaustive and Siri may recognize many other phrases.\n\nWhen managing CarPlay features, users don’t need to include the name of the app in the phrases that they speak. Siri knows automatically when CarPlay is active and routes CarPlay-related intents to the app of the corresponding automotive vendor.",
