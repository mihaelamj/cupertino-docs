Use this method to verify that you can perform a date-based search for the type specified by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent\/dateSearchType] property of the intent. If the type is [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INDateSearchType\/unknown] or you don’t consider dates when performing the search, return a resolution indicating you don’t need the date type. Return a successful resolution if you support searching using the specified type or return a different result if you don’t support the user requested type.",
