Use the provided payee information in the intent object to locate the corresponding user in your app. Always strive toward a successful resolution to a specific user, but always ask for confirmation of the selected user if there is some uncertainty.\n\nIf multiple users match the provided payee information, you might ask for disambiguation of the most likely candidates. When disambiguating users, provide as few choices as possible. If you find more than five possible users, consider a different resolution.\n\nIf you identify a user but there is a problem in sending funds to that user, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSendPaymentPayeeResolutionResult\/unsupported(forReason:)] method to create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSendPaymentPayeeResolutionResult] object that indicates you can’t the payee.",
