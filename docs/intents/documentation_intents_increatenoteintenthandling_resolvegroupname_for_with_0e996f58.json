Groups are a way for you to organize the notes of your app. For example, the Notes app provides a group for the services, such as iCloud, that manage notes.\n\nIf the intent does not contain a group name, choose a resolution that is most appropriate for your app. If your app does not support organizing notes into groups, you might return a result indicating that the group name is not required. If you are able to select a default group for the note, create a successful resolution that includes the name of the group you selected.",
