If the search type is [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INDateSearchType\/unknown], return a value of not required to indicate that you do not intend to use the date information during the search. If the search type is a different value, return a successful resolution if the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent\/dateTime] property of the intent contains enough information to perform the search.
