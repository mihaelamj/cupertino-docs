  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAutomotive vendors whose cars support the saving of seat and other environment settings can add support for this intent to an Intents extension that they ship with their automotive apps. When users engage Siri to save the current environment settings, SiriKit creates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSaveProfileInCarIntent] object and delivers it to the app’s Intents extension. You use the intent object to get the name or index of the profile to use when saving the settings.\n\nYou’re responsible for determining which settings to save and restore with user profiles. You can save seat-related settings, climate control settings, defroster settings, radio settings, other settings in your vehicle, or any combination of those settings. Siri handles only the name or index of the profile and doesn’t ask you to provide a list of the settings that you saved.\n\nThe object that handles this intent must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSaveProfileInCarIntentHandling] protocol. Use this intent object to resolve the audio source details and to create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSaveProfileInCarIntentResponse] object indicating the results of changing the audio source.\n\n### Additional Intent Attributes\n\nThe following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:\n\n### Example Phrases\n\nUsers can ask Siri to save profile settings in a vehicle in a variety of ways. The table below provides a few sample phrases in different languages. You can use these phrases during testing to trigger your intents. This list is not exhaustive and Siri may recognize many other phrases.\n\nWhen managing CarPlay features, users do not need to include the name of the app in the phrases that they speak. Siri knows automatically when CarPlay is active and routes CarPlay-related intents to the app of the corresponding automotive vendor.",
