You might use this method to verify that your service is available and that the user has a valid account.

Specify as much information about the ride as you can. A ride status object includes information about the vehicle and driver that are picking up the user’s party, the pickup and drop off locations, the price of the ride, and the current status of the ride. If the user does not have an active ride, specify `nil` in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INGetRideStatusIntentResponse\/rideStatus] property of the response object.
