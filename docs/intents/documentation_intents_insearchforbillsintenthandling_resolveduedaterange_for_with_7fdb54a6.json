If a date range is available and usable, return a successful resolution with that date range. You can also make adjustments to the date range as needed and ask the user for confirmation.\n\nIf the user didn’t specify a date range, return a resolution of not required from this method. When the user didn’t specify a date range, you must decide how you want to filter results when performing the subsequent search. For example, you might want to return only the currently due bills.
