You create an instance of this class and associate it with your response to that intent.\n\nDepending on the preferences you return to the system about how to display guest information, the user might have the option of changing the name and contact info assigned to a reservation. When that happens, the system may return a new instance of this class during the final booking stages of the reservation with the revised guest information.",
