Use this method to verify that the specified account exists and you can use it as the source of a funds transfer. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INTransferMoneyIntent\/fromAccount] property of the intent object contains any information provided by the user about which account to use. Don’t try to verify that the account has sufficient funds for the transfer. Instead, verify that the account has sufficient funds in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INTransferMoneyIntentHandling\/confirm(intent:completion:)] method.\n\nReturn a successful resolution if you’re able to verify the existence of the account. If the user doesn’t have any accounts to facilitate a transfer, return a successful resolution or indicate that the account isn’t required and then use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INTransferMoneyIntentHandling\/confirm(intent:completion:)] method to report an appropriate error. If the user has multiple accounts that match the provided information, either pick one and ask for confirmation or use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPaymentAmountResolutionResult\/disambiguation(with:)] method to create a resolution that prompts the user to select an account.",
