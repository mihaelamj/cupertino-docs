You might use this method to verify that your service is available and that the user has a valid account. Create a response object with an appropriate code indicating your app’s readiness and execute the provided `completion` block.\n\nWhen configuring your response object, try to include the available ride options that you would when handling the intent. Providing a complete response object is good way to ensure that you are able to provide the needed information.\n\nMaps does not call this method. The Maps interface lets the user specify the pickup and drop-off locations explicitly, making confirmation of those values unnecessary.",
