For apps that support reminders based on the current time, use this method to resolve the trigger information. If time-based reminders are optional, return a successful resolution when the user provides trigger information or return a [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INIntentResolutionResult\/notRequired()] resolution when there’s no trigger information. If the intent includes some trigger information, but not enough for a successful resolution, you can ask the user to confirm or disambiguate from among the possible values.",
