If a date range is available and usable, return a successful resolution with that date range. You can also make adjustments to the date range as needed and ask the user for confirmation.\n\nIf the user didn’t specify a date range, return a resolution of not required from this method. When the user didnt specify a date range, you must decide how you want to filter results during the subsequent search. For example, you might want to return only the user’s most recently paid bills. Alternatively, you could return all paid bills from the past month or from the past year.",
