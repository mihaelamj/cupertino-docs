  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nSiri creates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPayBillIntent] object when the user asks to pay a bill for a designated payee. A pay bill intent object includes the payment amount, the payment date, and the recipient of the payment. Use that information to validate the transaction and to schedule the payment.\n\nTo handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPayBillIntentHandling] protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPayBillIntentResponse] object with the results of scheduling the bill payment.\n\nThis intent object represents a financial transaction between the user and an entity (such as a utility company or credit card bill) defined in your app. You’re responsible for configuring and managing the entities that accept the payment of bills.\n\n### Additional Intent Attributes\n\nThe following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:\n\nWhen performing a search, Siri automatically asks the user to unlock a currently locked device. You don’t need to explicitly ask to unlock the device. In addition, Siri always prompts the user to confirm the request before asking your Intents extension to handle it.\n\n### Example Phrases\n\nUsers can ask Siri to initiate the payment of a bill in a variety of ways. The table below provides a few sample phrases in different languages. You can use these phrases during testing to trigger your intents. This list isn’t exhaustive and Siri may recognize many other phrases.\n\nIn the preceding examples, `<appName>` represents the name of the app whose Intents extension initiates the transaction. If your app uses custom names for contacts, you can tell Siri about those names using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INVocabulary] class.",
