If the search type is unknown, return a value of not required to indicate that you do not intend to use the location information during the search. If the search type is a different value, return a successful resolution if the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent\/location] property of the intent contains enough information to perform the search. Return a different result if it does not.",
