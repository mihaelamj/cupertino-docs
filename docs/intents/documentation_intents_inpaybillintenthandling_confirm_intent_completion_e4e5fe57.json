You might use this method to validate the following information:\n\n- The user has logged in to your app, and is therefore authorized to make payments.\n- The payee is valid and provided a bill that requires payment.\n- The user’s payment account is valid and contains sufficient funds to pay the bill.\n- The amount paid by the user is greater than the minimum amount associated with the bill.\n- The date for making the payment occurs before the bill’s due date.\n\nAt some point in your implementation, execute the provided completion block with a response object containing the transaction details. Siri displays this information to the user during the confirmation process.\n\nWhen configuring your response object, specify the bill details and the user account to transfer the money from. You also specify the scheduled transaction date. For more information about creating the response object, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPayBillIntentResponse].\n\n",
