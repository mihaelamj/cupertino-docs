Although you are providing details about how you intend to book the ride, do not actually book the ride from this method. Siri or Maps will present the details of your response to the user. If the user changes any ride properties prior to confirmation, you may have to resolve those properties and confirm the updated request again before handling the booking.\n\nPut as many details as possible in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideStatus] object you configure with your response object. For more information about configuring the ride status object, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideStatus].\n\nMaps may update the pickup location for the ride either before or after calling this method based on user input. Always use the information in the intent parameter to generate your confirmation response.",
