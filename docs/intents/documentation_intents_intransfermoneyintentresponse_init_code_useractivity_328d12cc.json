If you specify `nil`, the system automatically creates a user activity object for you, sets its type to the class name of the intent, and fills it with an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction] object containing the intent and your response.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn initialized response object or `nil` if the object could not be created.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAfter initializing the response object, put the transaction details into the properties of the object.
