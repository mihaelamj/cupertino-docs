Adjust the date, as needed, to ensure that you can perform the transfer. If the user doesn’t specify a date, assume that the user wants to transfer the money immediately.\n\nReturn a successful resolution if you’re able to schedule the transfer on the requested date, or if there’s no date and you can perform the transaction immediately. If the user-specified date falls on a banking holiday or on a date when you’d be unable to schedule the transaction, suggest a different date and ask the user for confirmation or use a disambiguation resolution to ask the user to select from two or three alternative dates.",
