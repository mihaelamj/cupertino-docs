The [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPayBillIntent\/transactionAmount] property of the intent contains information about how much the user wants to pay, which might be a precise amount or might be a relative amount such as the minimum due or the current balance. If a precise amount wasn’t specified, use the details provided by the payee to fill in the precise amount in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPaymentAmount] object you create. For example, if the user asks to pay the minimum due and the payee indicates that the minimum due is $25, include both values in the resulting [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INPaymentAmount] object.\n\nReturn a successful resolution if you’re able to identify the payment amount. Use other resolutions to prompt the user for more information if you’re unable to determine the precise amount to apply to the bill.",
