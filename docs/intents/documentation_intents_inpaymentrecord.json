Siri conveys this detailed information to the user at appropriate times.\n\nWhen creating payment records, specify as many details as possible. Siri always asks the user to confirm payments before asking your Intents extension to process them. During confirmation, Siri displays the information from this object in the confirmation interface. Omitting important pieces of information, such as the recipient or currency amount, might cause the user to cancel the transaction.",
