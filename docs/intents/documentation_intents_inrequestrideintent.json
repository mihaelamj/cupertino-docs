  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nSiriKit creates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRequestRideIntent] object when the user asks to book a ride using your app. A ride request intent contains user-supplied information about the ride, such as its starting point and the number of people. Use this intent object to identify possible ride options for the user to choose from and to book the ride after the user confirms it.\n\nTo handle this intent, the handler object in your Intents extension must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRequestRideIntentHandling] protocol. Your handler should confirm the request and create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRequestRideIntentResponse] object with information about whether your app successfully booked the ride.\n\nWhen implementing ride-booking support, provide a GeoJSON file with the regions for which you are able to provide rides and upload that file as your app’s Routing App Coverage File in App Store Connect. When it needs to suggest apps capable of providing a ride, Maps uses your coverage information to determine whether it should suggest your app. If you do not provide a coverage file and your app is not installed on the user’s device, Maps does not suggest your app. For information about how to create and upload a Routing App Coverage File, see [https:\/\/help.apple.com\/itunes-connect\/developer\/#\/dev4ba662442].\n\n### Additional Intent Attributes\n\nThe following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:",
