The user can optionally specify a date on which to schedule payment. If the user doesn’t specify a date, assume that the user wants to pay the bill immediately. Don’t check to see if the scheduled date occurs before the bill’s due date. Instead, use this method only to identify the date on which you can perform the transaction.\n\nReturn a successful resolution if you’re able to schedule the transaction on the date requested by the user, or if you’re able to schedule the transaction immediately. If the user-specified date falls on a banking holiday or on a date when you’d be unable to schedule the transaction, suggest a different date and ask the user for confirmation or use a disambiguation resolution to ask the user to select from two or three alternative dates.",
