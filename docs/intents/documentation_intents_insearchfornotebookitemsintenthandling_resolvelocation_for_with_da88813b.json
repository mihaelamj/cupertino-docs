Use this method to verify that you can perform a location-based search for the type specified by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent\/locationSearchType] property of the intent. If the type is [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INLocationSearchType\/unknown] or you do not consider locations when performing the search, you can return a resolution indicating that the location type is not required. Return a successful resolution if you support searching using the specified type or return a different result if you do not support the specific type requested by the user.",
