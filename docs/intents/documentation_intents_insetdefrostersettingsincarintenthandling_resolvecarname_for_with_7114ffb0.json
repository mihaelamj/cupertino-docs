If the app has access to more than one car, use the intent’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetDefrosterSettingsInCarIntent\/carName] property to identify the correct car. If the app has access to only a single car, you can call the completion block with a `notRequired()` resolution for Swift and `resolutionResultNotRequired` resolution for Objective-C, to indicate that the app doesn’t need the car name.",
