You may specify a pickup location that is different than the one requested by the user. For example, you might specify a dedicated pickup spot or an easy to spot point of interest that is near the user’s location. If you do not implement this method, SiriKit assumes that you are able to start the ride at the specified location.\n\nIf the pickup location is outside of your service area, return a successful resolution from this method and then create an appropriate response object with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRequestRideIntentResponseCode\/failureRequiringAppLaunchNoServiceInArea] code in your [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRequestRideIntentHandling\/confirm(intent:completion:)] method.\n\nMaps does not call this method.
