The due date is usually provided by the bill payee and reflects the date after which the institution may apply late fees. If the intent doesn’t contain the due date, retrieve the due date from your own internal records and return it as part of your successful resolution. Providing the due date is always encouraged because it helps the user determine the date on which to schedule payment.\n\nIf the payee didn’t provide you with a due date, you can return a resolution indicating it the value isn’t required. However, you might want to verify that the user supplied a date on which to schedule the payment and that the provided date isn’t too far in the future.",
