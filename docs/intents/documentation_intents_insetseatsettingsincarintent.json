  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAutomotive venders can add support for this intent to an Intents extension that they ship with their automotive apps. When the user asks Siri to change a seat-related setting, Siri creates an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetSeatSettingsInCarIntent] object and delivers it to the app’s Intents extension. You use the intent to identify which setting the user wants to change.\n\nThis class contains properties for multiple types of seat-related settings, but a given instance of this class contains changes for only one setting at a time. When resolving and confirming the parameters of this intent, use the specified properties to modify your vehicle’s seat settings. Assume no changes for other settings. If your vehicle doesn’t support a particular setting, offer a reasonable fallback setting and ask the user for confirmation.\n\nThe object that handles this intent must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetSeatSettingsInCarIntentHandling] protocol. Use this intent object to identify which setting changed and to create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetSeatSettingsInCarIntentResponse] object indicating the results of changing the seat settings.\n\n### Additional Intent Attributes\n\nThe following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:\n\n### Example Phrases\n\nUsers can ask Siri to change the seat settings in a vehicle in a variety of ways. The table below provides a few sample phrases in different languages. You can use these phrases during testing to trigger your intents. This list isn’t exhaustive and Siri may recognize many other phrases.\n\nWhen managing CarPlay features, users don’t need to include the name of the app in the phrases that they speak. Siri knows automatically when CarPlay is active and routes CarPlay-related intents to the app of the corresponding automotive vendor.",
