Use the information in the `intent` object to identify the corresponding users in your app. Always strive toward a successful resolution of the specified users, but feel free to ask for confirmation for one or more users if there’s some uncertainty.\n\nIf you find multiple users matching the same name, consider asking the user to disambiguate from among the most likely candidates. When disambiguating users, provide as few choices as possible. If you find more than five possible users, consider another resolution.",
