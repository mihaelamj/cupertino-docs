That name corresponds either to a ride option name defined in your global vocabulary file or a spoken term that Siri interpreted as the preferred ride option. Use the provided information to ensure that you recognize the vehicle type and that a vehicle of that type is available. If the specified vehicle type is not available, create a resolution result containing a different ride option and ask the user to confirm the new value.\n\nIf you do not implement this method, Siri assumes that you are able to book the ride using the information provided by the user.\n\nMaps does not call this method. The Maps interface lets the user choose a ride option explicitly, making resolution of that value unnecessary.",
