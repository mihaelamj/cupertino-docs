Specify as much information about the ride as you can. A ride status object includes information about the vehicle and driver that are picking up the user’s party, the pickup and drop off locations, the price of the ride, and the current status of the ride. If the user does not have an active ride, specify `nil` in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INGetRideStatusIntentResponse\/rideStatus] property of the response object. For more information about configuring the ride status object, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRideStatus].\n\nMaps may call this method multiple times after the user books a ride using your service to ensure that it is displaying the latest information in its interface.
