Automotive vendors can use this intent to change the settings on a vehicle’s built-in entertainment system.\n\nThis properties of this class support identifying a radio station in several different ways, but a given instance of this class contains doesn’t populate all of those properties. When resolving and confirming the parameters of this intent, use the properties that are available to change the station.\n\nThe object that handles this intent must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetRadioStationIntentHandling] protocol. Use this intent object to identify the selected station and to create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INSetRadioStationIntentResponse] object indicating the results of changing the station.\n\n### Additional Intent Attributes\n\nThe following table lists additional attributes of this intent object:\n\n### Example Phrases\n\nThere are many ways in which users can ask Siri to change the radio station. The table below provides a few sample phrases in different languages. You can use these phrases during testing to trigger your intents. This list isn’t exhaustive and Siri may recognize many other phrases.\n\nWhen managing CarPlay features, users don’t need to include the name of the app in the phrases that they speak.
