Groups are a way for you to organize the task lists of your app. For example, the Reminders app automatically provides a group for each unique service, such as iCloud, that manages task lists and tasks.\n\nIf the intent doesn’t contain a group name, choose a resolution that’s most appropriate for your app. If your app doesn’t support organizing notes into groups, you might return a result indicating that the group name isn’t required. If you’re able to select a default group for the note, create a successful resolution that includes the name of the group you selected.",
