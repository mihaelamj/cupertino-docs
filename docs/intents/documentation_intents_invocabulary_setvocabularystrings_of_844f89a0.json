You may register different sets of strings for each of the supported types, but you may register only one group of strings for each type. Calling this method again for a given type replaces the previously registered strings already assigned to that type.\n\nDo not use this method to register terminology that is common to all users of your app. Use this method only to register terms that are specific to the current user. Common terminology should be included in the vocabulary property list file that you include with your Intents extension.\n\nCalling this method is not a guarantee that Siri will use the terms you supply. If you specify more than just a few strings, Siri may ingest only the first few strings rather than the entire list. So always place the most important strings first in the ordered set. In addition, if any of the strings exceed the maximum size limit, Siri ignores them.\n\nIt is a programmer error to register terms that are not supported by any of your extension’s intents.",

Each [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString] object should contain terms that are unique to your app and to the specific user. Sort the strings in descending order of importance. In other words, the first string should be the most important, followed by strings of decreasing importance. Each string must be no more than 1024 bytes.\n- **type**: The designated purpose for the strings in the `vocabulary` parameter. You must specify one of the designated types. You cannot specify custom types of strings. For a list of possible values, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INVocabularyStringType].\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to register user-specific vocabulary terms of the specified type.
