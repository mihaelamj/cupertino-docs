For example, if you have associated an interaction identifier with a playlist, you can delete all the interactions about the list if the user deletes it.\n\nIf you provide a block in the `completion` parameter, the system executes your block asynchronously with the results.",

This string corresponds to the value stored in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INInteraction\/groupIdentifier] property of the interaction objects.\n- **completion**: A block to execute with the results. Provide a block if you want to know whether the deletion action succeeded. The block has no return value and takes the following parameter.\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nCall this method to delete a group of donated Siri interactions.
