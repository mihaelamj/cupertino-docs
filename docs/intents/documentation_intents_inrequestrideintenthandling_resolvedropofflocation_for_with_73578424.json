You may specify a drop-off location that is different than the one requested by the user. For example, you might specify a dedicated drop-off spot or an easy to spot point of interest that is near the user’s requested drop-off location. If you do not implement this method, SiriKit assumes that you are able to end the ride at the specified location.\n\nIf the drop-off location is outside of your service area, return a successful resolution from this method and then create an appropriate response object with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRequestRideIntentResponseCode\/failureRequiringAppLaunchNoServiceInArea] code in your [doc:\/\/com.apple.sirikit\/documentation\/Intents\/INRequestRideIntentHandling\/confirm(intent:completion:)] method.\n\nMaps does not call this method. The Maps interface lets the user specify the drop-off location explicitly, making resolution of that value unnecessary.",
