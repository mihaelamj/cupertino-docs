  "overview" : "Your app’s data drives everything you do, and Apple frameworks provide the types you need to represent that data. Build your data structures with basic types like numbers, strings, dates, URLs. Add collections and other types to organize large amounts of data. Persist data to disk securely, storing your app’s data in designated locations in the file system or in iCloud. Make use of someone’s music, contacts, photos, and other personal data in a privacy friendly way.\n\n## Standard data types and processes\n\nAll apps use integers, floating-point numbers, strings, URLs, collections, and other primitive types to store data. When you use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/swift-standard-library] and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation] framework, you get object-oriented versions of these types that work on all Apple platforms. These types also support security and convenience features that make them easier to use in your code.\n\n## Structured data models\n\nBuild a scalable and efficient data model for your app using technologies like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftData] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreData]. Both technologies offer straightforward ways to build your data structures, and fetch only the data you need. They also offer the features you’d expect, like persistence, undo support, and iCloud integration.\n\n## Files and directories\n\nLearn about the structure of the file system on Apple devices, and how to access that file system using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation] framework. If you manage your app’s data using technologies such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftData], you might not work with files often. When you do, you need to know where to put them, and how to manage them efficiently. You also need to understand some of the special conventions that Apple platforms use to minimize the complexity of the file system for people using Apple devices.\n\n## Shared data\n\nMake your app’s data available where it’s needed — on one device or multiple devices. Place your data in iCloud to create a feeling of continuity for people moving from one device to the next. Similarly, share data between your app and one of your app extensions to keep your own content synchronized and up to date.\n\n## Personal data\n\nApple devices can contain a lot of personal information, including contacts, photos, locations, health information, and more. People use the system apps to manage some of this data, but your app can also contribute to that data in a privacy friendly way. Let people know what data you plan to access.",
