  "overview" : "Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device for media playback. With ultra-high-resolution displays, advanced spatial audio, and ability to scale content to fit your environment, it’s like having a 3D movie theater with you wherever you go. Create apps to help people capture personal moments in spatial video, provide an extraordinary playback experience, or deliver your next feature film in Apple Immersive Video.\n\n## Capture spatial video\n\nSpatial video is an innovative 3D video format that captures scenes with depth and dimension. People record spatial videos directly on Apple Vision Pro or with the Camera app on supported iPhone models. Watching spatial video on Vision Pro gives the viewer the sense that the action is right in from of them, which makes it a great format for reliving their important moments.\n\nSupport spatial video capture in your own custom camera app using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation]. The framework extends the features you use to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation\/avcam-building-a-camera-app] to enable spatial video capture. Save recorded videos to a person’s Photos library with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/PhotoKit] framework. By adopting PhotoKit, you ensure that people can store captured videos in the same place they expect to find all their memories.\n\n## Play immersive media\n\nApple Vision Pro supports playback of a wide variety of video formats, including 2D, 3D, and fully immersive. Regardless of the type of video you want to play, Apple provides a consistent set of APIs to make it straightforward to build a compelling playback experience in visionOS.\n\nPlaying immersive media on Vision Pro builds on the same functionality provided by [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVFoundation] that you [doc:\/\/com.apple.TechnologyOverviews\/documentation\/TechnologyOverviews\/video] with on other platforms. This common functionality makes it straightforward to build playback apps that work across platforms, and deliver an immersive experience on Apple Vision Pro. To play spatial and immersive video in a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/avkit\/playing-immersive-media-with-avkit], adopt [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVPlayerViewController] from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit] framework. This API provides the same playback interface found in the TV app and supports features like presenting video in system environments. In visionOS, a player view controller also provides an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AVKit\/AVExperienceController] that makes it simple to transition between different presentation styles like multiview or immersive. To build a [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/visionos\/playing-immersive-media-with-realitykit], use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/RealityKit] components to present spatial and immersive media.

Captured using specialized camera systems like the Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive, these videos feature 8K resolution per eye, Spatial Audio, and dynamic head tracking that creates a sense of depth that goes beyond traditional 2D or even 3D video.
