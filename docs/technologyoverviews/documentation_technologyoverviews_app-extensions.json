  "overview" : "Apps let people experience your content within the interface you create, but sometimes people want that same content outside of your app. For example, someone using a weather app might want to see the forecast on their iPhone Lock Screen or on the face of their Apple Watch. If your server generates notifications with images, you might want people to see those images in the system’s notification interface. You deliver these types of features using app extensions.\n\nAn *app extension* is a separate bundle that ships as part of your app and vends your app’s services to other parts of the system. Because app extensions are separate from your app, the system can launch and run them separately from your app. Some app extensions have an interface that the system displays, but many app extensions simply provide information for the system to use. For example, a Spotlight Import app extension indexes the content in one of your app’s custom file types.\n\n## Choose an app extension\n\niOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS support app extensions for specific features like sharing, Notification Center, or Safari.
