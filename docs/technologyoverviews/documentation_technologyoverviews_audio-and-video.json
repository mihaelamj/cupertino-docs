  "overview" : "You can use Apple technologies to handle multimedia content, whether you’re playing sounds as part of your interface, streaming video from your servers, or creating a professional media-editing app. Explore higher-level functionality when you want to focus on content, and let the system manage the presentation of that content. Adopt lower-level technologies when you want more control over the media experience.\n\n## Video\n\nApple’s robust support for video playback, capture, and editing enables you to create powerful apps that seamlessly handle complex multimedia tasks. By providing a comprehensive set tools and frameworks, Apple enables you to build apps that deliver smooth, high-quality video experiences that take advantage of system hardware and software features.\n\n## Audio and music\n\nApple platforms offer comprehensive support for playing and processing audio in a wide range of formats that provide an ideal environment for audio developers. Whether you want to stream audio from Apple Music, support Spatial Audio your game, or intelligently identify audio and music, Apple provides the tools that enable you to bring your ideas to life.\n\n## Immersive media\n\nApple Vision Pro is an incredible platform for media playback that enables you to create immersive, interactive, and highly personalized viewing experiences. With its high-resolution displays and dynamic Spatial Audio support, it offers an immersive, theater-like environment to experience audio and video playback. Whether you’re building an app for people to watch video in an immersive environment, enabling them to relive memories they’ve captured in spatial video, or placing them in the middle of the action with Apple Immersive content, Apple provides the technologies you need to create revolutionary media playback experiences.\n\n## Streaming\n\nApple’s media streaming technologies enable the seamless delivery of audio and video. People can wirelessly stream their favorite music, TV shows, and movies to devices like Apple TV, HomePod, and an ever-growing list of supported third-party devices. Content creators can deliver their media over the internet to a wide variety of devices to provide a smooth, secure, and adaptive playback experience.",
