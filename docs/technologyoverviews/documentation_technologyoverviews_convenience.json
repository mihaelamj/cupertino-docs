  "overview" : "Incorporate features that make it easier for people to do the things they want to do. When you adopt the right technologies, it takes less effort to make your app more convenient to use. Some technologies even provide the fundamental support you need to implement other features. For example, Handoff and App Clips require you to implement universal links for your app’s content.\n\n## Provide consistent URLs for app content\n\nURLs are a consistent way for people to access content on the web, and universal links extend that consistency to your apps. When you [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content] in your app, the same URLs people use to access your website work in your app, too. Many features rely on universal links, including:\n\nAdopting universal links creates a two-way association between your app and your company’s website. When someone opens a URL on their iPhone or other device, the system opens that URL in the default web browser by default. However, if your app is installed on that device, the system can reroute those URLs to your app instead. Directing URLs to your app can lead to a better experience, but only if your app handles those URLs correctly.\n\nWhen the system [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/supporting-universal-links-in-your-app], analyze the contents of the URL to identify the request and present the requested content from your interface. For example, if a URL contains a link to a product on your company’s website, display the matching product page in your app. When configuring your interface, do your best to make it look like the person launched your app and navigated to the intended product page.\n\nTo prevent other apps from opening links intended for your website, universal links require an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.developer.associated-domains], which you add to your Xcode project. You must also [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/supporting-associated-domains] and create an association between the site and your app. This two-way validation process helps protect against malicious apps trying to intercept your links.\n\n## Transfer activities to other devices\n\nHandoff is a way for people to start an activity on one device, and transfer that activity to a different device with the same Apple ID. Handoff works with iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac, so add support if you offer your app on more than one of those platforms.\n\nTo add Handoff support, you first must consider which tasks someone might be able to transfer to another device. A shopping app might transfer the URL of the product page someone is viewing. A reading app might transfer the book and page number someone is reading. A media app might transfer the name of the audio or video file and the current playback location. In each case, choose activities a person knowingly starts, and might reasonably want to continue on their other device, and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/implementing-handoff-in-your-app#3112023] in your Xcode project.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/implementing-handoff-in-your-app] automatically via Handoff when someone starts that activity. At that time, collect the activity-related details and put them into an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] object. Enable the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/isEligibleForHandoff] property of that object, and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/becomeCurrent()]. Alternatively, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/implementing-handoff-in-your-app#3112026] and let the system manage the activation of your object.\n\nBecause Handoff transfers your app’s data from one device to another, make transfers fast by putting as little data as possible in your [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] objects. A shopping app that lets someone continue viewing product information might include only the URL of the product page, using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.TechnologyOverviews\/documentation\/TechnologyOverviews\/convenience#Provide-consistent-URLs-for-app-content]. A video app might transfer only the name or URL of the video and not the video file itself. Because the devices that accept Handoff transfers share an Apple ID, you can expect them to have access to the same content.\n\n## Generate previews for custom data formats\n\nIf your app has custom document formats, include a Quick Look Preview app extension to generate a preview of files that use those formats. Quick Look is a system feature that people use to view the contents of a file or document without opening it. They can use this feature to verify a file contains the content they expect before opening it. The Finder displays a Quick Look preview when someone selects a file and presses the Spacebar key, and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/activity-views] and other system interfaces also incorporate Quick Look previews.\n\nCreate a Quick Look Preview app extension using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuickLook] framework, and include it with the app that owns one of your custom file formats. Create the app extension only for custom file formats that you define. You don’t need this app extension if you rely solely on standard file formats. The system already generates previews for many standard text and image file formats, PDFs, audio and video files, USDZ files, and more.\n\nIf you have a macOS app that shows files as part of its interface, add previews for those files using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuickLookUI] framework. This framework provides panels and views that show the contents of files that have defined previews. These panels show both the standard file formats and any custom formats that apps provide.\n\n## Adopt a fast login workflow\n\nIf your app or website requires a login and password, give people the option to log in using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SigninwithApple]. When someone needs to perform a task quickly, prompting them for their login and password information can be inconvenient and delay their access to that information. Sign in with Apple lets people log in to apps and websites using Face ID or Touch ID from their device, and using credentials that map to their Apple ID. This approach respects people’s privacy, while giving you greater confidence that the account information you receive represents real people.\n\n\n\nYou adopt Sign in with Apple in several different ways:\n\nFor a media streaming app that runs on multiple platforms, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/VideoSubscriberAccount\/signing-people-in-to-media-apps-automatically] to get people to your content more quickly. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/VideoSubscriberAccount] framework supports an Automatic Sign-In workflow, which you use to generate a token that authorizes the person’s access to your services. The framework stores this token on the person’s Apple Account, making it available to all of their devices. If the token is present at app startup, use it to log in automatically instead of asking for the person’s credentials. Update the token, or remove it entirely, using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AutomaticSignInAPI].\n\n## Incorporate content shared in Messages\n\nPeople often receive links and other content when they’re not ready to receive it. [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SharedWithYou] makes it easier for you to incorporate the links that people share into your app. The framework extracts app-specific links people send using Messages and makes them available to your app. You can display this list of links to people from a custom view in your app, giving them quick access to content they might have forgotten about in their Messages conversations.\n\nShared with You relies on your app adopting [doc:\/\/com.apple.TechnologyOverviews\/documentation\/TechnologyOverviews\/convenience#Provide-consistent-URLs-for-app-content] for its content. You must also [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/adding-capabilities-to-your-app] to your app to receive links from Messages. After you adopt these features, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/videos\/play\/wwdc2022\/10094] in the following ways:\n\nIn addition to managing shared items in Messages, you can also use Shared with You to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SharedWithYou\/adding-shared-content-collaboration-to-your-app] for content your app creates. You might use this approach for content you put in CloudKit, iCloud Drive, or another shared storage server. After you place the content in a shared location, use Shared with You types to present UI for sharing that content with other people.\n\n## Allow people to try your app quickly\n\nPeople use apps for many kinds of tasks, but they might not always have the app they need when they need it. An App Clip helps people discover your app at a moment when they might not have time to download the full version. For example, the system can display your App Clip to help someone set up a new appliance, rent a scooter, or order take-out from a restaurant. This convenience can help convince people to download the full version of your app later.\n\nAn App Clip focuses on one task and performs it quickly, ideally in only a few seconds. People discover your App Clip using special App Clip codes, NFC tags, QR codes, links you send out, and place cards in Maps. For example, you might place an App Clip code on the scooters you rent to people. When someone scans the code, the system downloads and launches the App Clip to start the task immediately.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppClip\/creating-an-app-clip-with-xcode] in Xcode by adding an App Clip target to your project. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppClip] framework to implement your clip, and add any app-specific code you need to complete the intended task. Keep the size of your App Clip as small as possible, and include only the code and assets you absolutely need. App Clips have size limitations so the system can download them quickly.\n\nIn addition to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppClip\/distributing-your-app-clip] to the App Store, begin work on [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppClip\/creating-app-clip-codes] people use to access launch your App Clip. Include these codes in promotional materials or in the place where people encounter your services and need to use your App Clip.\n\nAdditional things to know when creating your App Clip include:",
