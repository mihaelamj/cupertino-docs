On Apple platforms, you create search interfaces and manage your app’s indexed content using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreSpotlight]. Adopting Core Spotlight for search has some other advantages:\n\n- People can find your content from the system’s Spotlight search interface.\n- Siri can use content from your app’s indexes when responding to spoken requests.\n- Apple Intelligence automatically performs a semantic analysis of your indexed content, allowing people to find your content based on semantic matches, in addition to lexical matches.\n\nIf your app creates [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity] objects for relevant actions, add those objects to your app’s search indexes, too. For example, if a person views information about a particular restaurant in your app, create an activity object and set its [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSUserActivity\/isEligibleForSearch] property to `true`. If someone searches for restaurants later using Spotlight, the system can include the restaurant from your activity object in the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Extend the reach of your content\n\nApps are one way to access content, but making your content available in other parts of the system helps people stay engaged with that content.\n\n- **Widgets** elevate a small amount of timely, personally relevant information, and display it where people can see it at a glance. On iPhone and iPad, people put widgets in Today View, on the Home Screen, and on the Lock Screen. On the Mac, people put widgets on the desktop and in Notification Center. On Apple Watch, widgets appear in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit#Smart-Stacks].\n- **Watch complications** are small elements on the Apple Watch face that display timely, relevant information. Complications might display the current weather conditions, or provide quick access to apps.\n- **Live Activities** display up-to-date content from your app. For example, they display event and task information on the Lock Screen or in the Dynamic Island. Live Activities use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ActivityKit] and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UserNotifications\/setting-up-a-remote-notification-server] (APNs) to deliver timely information.\n- **Controls** allow people to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Creating-controls-to-perform-actions-across-the-system] in Control Center, the Lock Screen, and from a device’s Action button.\n\nTo support any of these features, create an [doc:\/\/com.apple.TechnologyOverviews\/documentation\/TechnologyOverviews\/app-extensions] using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit] framework. Your app extension runs separately from your app and works with the system to display your content. Whenever possible, build your app extensions to run independently from your app. For example, design your app extension to fetch data over the network instead of sharing data with your app. However, you can share data between an app and app extension using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.TechnologyOverviews\/documentation\/TechnologyOverviews\/shared-data#Share-content-on-the-same-device] if needed.\n\nOn Apple Watch, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WidgetKit\/Widget-Suggestions-In-Smart-Stacks] in Smart Stacks by supplying contextual clues about their relevance.

For example, a map with a restaurant’s location makes it easier to understand how close that restaurant is to the person’s current location than the address alone. Incorporate other types of contextual information that make sense for your app, including:\n\n- **Maps.** Embed Apple Maps content in your app’s interface using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MapKit]. Annotate the maps in your interface with points of interest and other custom information. You can also configure turn-by-turn navigation to specific addresses. Specify rich placename information using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/GeoToolbox] framework.\n- **Weather.** Obtain weather forecasts and data related to weather events for a particular location using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/WeatherKit]. Display the weather information on its own or use it to make people aware of adverse weather conditions.\n- **Tips.** Help people discover your app’s new, interesting, or unused features using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/TipKit]. The framework helps point out features people might otherwise miss, and isn’t a subsitute for general help information.\n- **Rich-content links.** Display URLs in a content-rich and consistent way using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/LinkPresentation]. This framework fetches metadata such as page titles, images, video, and audio from the destination of a URL. Display that metadata yourself or present it using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/LinkPresentation\/LPLinkView]. You can also pass that metadata to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/activity-views] and other system experiences.\n- **Data detection.** Detect common types of data in text using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DataDetection]. This framework identifies dates, email addresses, flight numbers, web links, phone numbers, shipment tracking numbers, and other types of well-known data in text strings. It then provides that data in a more program-friendly format. For example, it provides a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/Date] type for date and time information in the text. You might use the provided date type to suggest an addition to the person’s calendar.\n- **Energy information.** Help people manage their energy usage using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/EnergyKit]. This framework provides a forecast of grid power at the person’s location to help them determine the best time to use electricity. Incorporate it into apps that manage appliance usage, EV charging, home thermostats, and other home devices.\n\n\n\n## Help people manage their device usage\n\nPeople sometimes need help managing the time they or their children spend on their devices. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/ScreenTime] framework gives you a way to help parents and guardians supervise their child’s web usage and take action against prohibited URLs. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/FamilyControls] framework prevents a child from circumventing the parental controls on their device.\n\nIf your app offers content suitable for specific age ranges, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/DeclaredAgeRange] framework offers a way to validate someone’s age in a privacy-friendly way.
