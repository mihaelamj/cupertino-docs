  "overview" : "To build your app’s interface, you can use standard system views, draw content yourself, or mix custom drawing with the standard views. Regardless of how you create your content, all interfaces rely on some standard components to present that content:\n\nThe app-builder technologies you use to create your app maintain a separation between your app’s data and the views and other interface elements you use to display that data. Your data model objects are always the source of truth for your app’s content. When you configure a view, you pass a copy of your data to the view for display purposes. If interactions with a view cause a value to change, your app’s infrastructure is responsible for synchronizing the changes with your data objects. When you use SwiftUI, this process is more automatic, but with UIKit and AppKit you synchronize the changes yourself.\n\n## Choose a design approach for the target platform\n\nThe platform you target naturally affects the approach you take to building your interface. You want apps to feel like they belong on a given platform, which might require you to tweak your interface on each platform.\n\n### iOS and iPadOS\n\nDesign [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/designing-for-ios] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/designing-for-ipados] apps as experiences people can take with them anywhere. Apps in iOS fill the screen, and apps in iPadOS need to be flexible enough to fill all or part of the screen. Because space is more constrained, interfaces make greater use of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/layout-and-organization] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/navigation-and-search] elements to organize content.\n\niOS and iPadOS apps need to handle different iPhone and iPad sizes and orientations gracefully. Make sure your app’s interface adjusts automatically to size changes. In SwiftUI, automatic layout is an integral part of the interface-creation process. In UIKit, adopt [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/view-layout] to adjust your interface at appropriate times. Take advantage of the Xcode interface editors so you can see how your interface looks in different configurations.\n\nOn iPad, don’t forget to support features that people can access from Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil. Magic Keyboard adds pointer-based navigation, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/menus], and hover-based interactions. Apple Pencil enables [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/handling-input-from-apple-pencil] and also lets you capture altitude, azimuth, and pressure information, which a drawing app can use for content creation.\n\n### macOS\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/designing-for-macos] app to take advantage of the power, space, and flexibility of a Mac. Mac gives you more space for your content, but that doesn’t mean you want a cluttered interface. Take advantage of the same [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/navigation-and-search] techniques as other platforms to create interfaces that present what people need when they need it.\n\nMake sure your windows support flexible layouts and adapt to different sizes and modes. In SwiftUI, automatic layout is an integral part of the interface-creation process. In AppKit, adopt [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/view-layout] to adjust your interface at appropriate times. Adopt [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/going-full-screen] mode for windows to give people the option to view your app in a distraction-free environment.\n\nThe menu bar along the top of the desktop displays your app’s menus. Identify your app’s relevant actions, and craft [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/menus] that reflect how people interact with your content.\n\n### tvOS\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/designing-for-tvos] with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/focus-and-selection] in mind. Most interactions with your app occur through the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/remotes]. People use the directional buttons on the remote to change focus from one part of your UI to another. They then use the select button to act on the focused item, or the Menu button to navigate back to the previous screen. Make navigation as straightforward as possible, and minimize text input and other complex interactions.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/lockups] are one way to simplify navigation and promote consistency among similar items in your UI. A lockup is a group of related views that you combine into a single, selectable element. For example, a movie lockup might include the movie’s title, description, cast list, and poster image. When someone selects a movie, tvOS places focus on the entire lockup instead of on individual items.\n\n### visionOS\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/designing-for-visionos] around an initial window to provide a familiar starting point for interactions.

Regardless of how you create your content, all interfaces rely on some standard components to present that content:\n\n- *Windows* are the primary containers for your app’s content, and they also facilitate system-related interactions. Every [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Windows], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/windows-and-screens], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/windows-panels-and-screens] app has at least one [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/windows], and some platforms let your app display multiple windows simultaneously. Windows in macOS, iPadOS, and visionOS can have a visible border and controls to change the size of the window. Windows in iOS, tvOS, and watchOS have no visible appearance of their own.\n- *Scenes* manage instances of your app’s interface in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS. Every [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Scenes] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/scenes] app has at least one scene, and you can create additional scenes to manage distinct experiences. Each scene manages the data for one instance of your interface and any relevant system behaviors. For example, each scene object handles transitions between the foreground and background execution states for that scene. AppKit apps don’t use scenes.\n- *Views and controls* display specific types of content in your interface. [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI#Views], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/views-and-controls], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/views-and-controls] provide views for displaying standard types of content like [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/image-views], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/text-views], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/collections], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/pickers], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/buttons], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/toggles], and much more. They also define the architecture that you use to create custom views and display any content you want.\n- *Volumes* are a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/VolumetricWindowStyle] of window that you use to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/visionOS\/adding-3d-content-to-your-app#Display-3D-content-in-a-volume] in visionOS.\n\nThe app-builder technologies you use to create your app maintain a separation between your app’s data and the views and other interface elements you use to display that data.

This type returns the URL for the filename you specify.\n\n## Apply standard behaviors to your interface\n\nThere are a few features you always want to build into your interface:\n\n- *Automatic layout*. Size and position the views of your interface using a rules-based approach, which allows your app to adapt automatically to different device sizes and orientations. Automatic layout is integral to SwiftUI, but you must add specific rules to your [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/view-layout] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/view-layout] interfaces.\n- *Internationalization*. Prepare your app for localization using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation] framework, which provides code to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/data-formatting] for different languages and regions. Ensure your UI looks good for both left-to-right and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/design\/Human-Interface-Guidelines\/right-to-left] languages. [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/localization] app resources and add them to your Xcode project.\n- *Accessibility*. Apple builds [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Accessibility] into its technologies, and screen readers and other accessibility features use that information to help people navigate your app. Review the default information that [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI#Accessibility], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/accessibility-for-uikit], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/accessibility-for-appkit] provide and make improvements based on your content. In addition, review your app’s focus-based navigation to make sure it’s simple and intuitive.\n- *Undo support*. Identify the actions people take in your app and build tasks that you can easily [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/UndoManager].\n- *Pasteboard*. Support data exchange in your app and the rest of the system through Cut, Copy, and Paste operations. A pasteboard type in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/Clipboard], [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit\/documents-data-and-pasteboard], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/documents-data-and-pasteboard] manages the content you transfer to it.\n\n## Consider platform-specific behaviors in your design\n\nWhen making decisions about how to build your interface, the platform you target affects some of the decisions you must make.
