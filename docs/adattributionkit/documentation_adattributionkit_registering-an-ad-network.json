Ad networks need to register with Apple before using the AdAttributionKit API.\n\nTo register your ad network, go to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/contact\/request\/ad-network-id\/], which prompts you to sign in and opens the request form.\n\nWhen registering, you:\n\n## Share your ad network ID with developers\n\nThe ad network ID is a unique lowercase identifier in the format of `example123.adattribuitionkit`. Share your ad network ID with app developers who display your ads. Developers need to include your ad network ID in their app’s information property list for your impressions to qualify for postbacks.\n\n## Generate your private key\n\nAd networks use a private cryptographic key to generate a signature for each ad that an app displays. During registration, ad networks create a public-private key pair, and send the public key to Apple. The private key you create uses an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with a prime256v1 curve.\n\nTo create your private key, open Terminal and enter the following command, replacing `companyname` with the name of your company:\n\n## Generate and share your public key\n\nNext, you create a public key from the private key you created in the previous section. The public key is a PEM-encoded PKCS #8 EC key that uses the prime256v1 curve. In Terminal, enter the following command, again replacing `companyname` with the name of your company:\n\nThis command creates the file `companyname_adattribuitionkit_public_key.pem`, which contains your public key. Run this command anytime to generate a copy of your public key file.\n\nSend your public key file to Apple when you register your ad network.",
