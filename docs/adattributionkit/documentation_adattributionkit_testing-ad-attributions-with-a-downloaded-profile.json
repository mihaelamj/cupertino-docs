This profile is compatible with both AdAttributionKit and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/SKAdNetwork].\n\nFor information about installing profiles, see [https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/102400]. You can install this profile on devices running iOS or iPadOS 17.4 or later.\n\nWith this profile, the installed app has 5 minutes to update the conversion value after initially registering. The device sends the postback within another 5 minutes after the rolling 5-minute timer for conversion updates expires. Using this profile reduces the conversion value update and postback window from 24–48 hours to 5–10 minutes.\n\nThis testing profile expires 2 weeks after you install it on the device. To continue testing, download the latest profile and reinstall it.\n\n## Inspect postbacks using an HTTP proxy\n\nWith this installed profile, the system can send AdAttributionKit postbacks through an HTTP proxy that you configure. By using an HTTP proxy, you can monitor the HTTP traffic between your device and the network, including AdAttributionKit postbacks. To configure the HTTP proxy, follow these steps on a testing device:\n\nWith the installed profile, the AdAttributionKit postbacks that the device sends go through the proxy.",

By using an HTTP proxy, you can monitor the HTTP traffic between your device and the network, including AdAttributionKit postbacks. To configure the HTTP proxy, follow these steps on a testing device:\n\n1. Choose Settings > Wi-Fi and select the Wi-Fi network you’re connected to.\n2. Under the HTTP Proxy heading, select Configure Proxy.\n3. Select Manual to configure the Server, Port, and Authentication settings for your proxy, or select Automatic to provide a URL for your proxy.\n4. Tap Save.\n\nWith the installed profile, the AdAttributionKit postbacks that the device sends go through the proxy.\n\n## Ad attribution testing\n\n- **Testing ad attributions with Developer Mode**: Reduce the time-window for ad attributions and inspect postbacks using a proxy during testing.\n- **Creating postbacks in developer settings**: Test development postbacks for your advertised app without interacting with ads from a publisher app.\n\n",
