You can use this capability, for example, to distinguish between measurements you apply to conversions that happen chronologically close to one another.\n\n## Receive conversion tags during reengagement opens\n\nWhen the system opens your app as the result of an AdAttributionKit reengagement, it supplies the conversion tag in the URL it passes to your app.\n\nThe system keys the value to the `AdAttributionKitReengagementOpen` key in the URL.\n\nIf this reengagement is of interest to you and you want to independently update it’s conversion value, persist the conversion tag along with some internal identifier to help you identify the conversion it belongs to.\n\n## Selectively update conversion values with conversion tags\n\nIn iOS 18.4 and later, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/PostbackUpdate] structure can accept an optional `String` property named [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/PostbackUpdate\/conversionTag] during initialization.\n\nDuring the flow to update the postback conversion value, initialize the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/PostbackUpdate] structure with the requisite values and with the conversion tag of the conversion.\n\nCall AdAttributionKit’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/Postback\/updateConversionValue(_:)] method, passing in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/PostbackUpdate] instance initialized before.\n\nIf the framework finds a conversion with the specified conversion tag, it updates it with the values you specify in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/PostbackUpdate] instance.",
