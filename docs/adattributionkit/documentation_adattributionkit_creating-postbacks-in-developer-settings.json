  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse the AdAttributionKit Development Postbacks tool in the developer settings to create development postbacks for your advertised app. This tool allows you to test your AdAttributionKit functionality without interacting with ads from a publisher app or publishing your app in the App Store or an alternate marketplace. Test your app from various distribution methods, such as those you build with Xcode, ad-hoc, or TestFlight.\n\nThis tool also allows you to configure the amount of data that returns in the postback to simulate different Crowd Anonymity tiers so you can validate server logic for receiving those postbacks. For more information about Crowd Anonymity tiers, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/identifying-the-parameters-in-a-postback].\n\nYou can access the AdAttributionKit tools by enabling Developer Mode on your test device. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device].\n\nAfter enabling Developer Mode, access the developer settings on your test device by choosing Settings > Developer. Then scroll down to the Ad Attribution Testing section and tap Development Postbacks, as the screenshot below shows:\n\n\n\n## Create a development postback\n\nTo create development postbacks for your app, type in your app’s bundle identifier and tap the Configure Development Postbacks button.\n\n\n\n### Provide the server URL to process the postback\n\nProvide the URL of the server to receive the development postbacks. AdAttributionKit sends the postback to this destination when the postback is eligible for transmission.\n\n\n\nYou can also tap Use Developer Postback URL to generate the full postback copy URL that the app’s information property list specifies. This is the same URL that AdAttributionKit generates when creating developer copies of postbacks in full end-to-end flows. For more information on receiving developer postback copies, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/configuring-an-advertised-app].\n\n### Fill in postback properties\n\nConfigure each property of the postback in this section. You can create variations of all properties in the postback, including the view or click interaction type, conversion types, and one or three conversion windows.\n\n\n\n### Add a conversion tag\n\nFill in a conversion tag if you’re testing the overlapping conversion windows feature. After you specify a conversion tag, you can update the postback by setting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/PostbackUpdate\/conversionTag] property and calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/Postback\/updateConversionValue(_:)]. For more information on overlapping conversion windows, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/conversion-tags].\n\n### Adjust postback data tiers\n\nAdAttributionKit uses Crowd Anonymity to control the amount of data the framework returns in postbacks in production flows. For each postback, adjust the amount of data that AdAttributionKit includes in the postback.\n\n\n\nYou can use this to test that your server logic is processing different postback data granularities correctly. For more information about Crowd Anonymity, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/receiving-postbacks-in-multiple-conversion-windows].\n\n### Examine the JWS of the development postback\n\nPostbacks you create using the developer settings have notable differences from postbacks you create in a full end-to-end flow:\n\nThe system signs development postbacks with a different private key from production postbacks to help distinguish them. The steps for verifying development postback signatures are identical to the steps for production postbacks, with the exception of the key you use. For more information on the public key for development postbacks and verifying a postback’s JWS signature, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/verifying-a-postback].\n\n## Transmit eligible development postbacks on-demand\n\nThe device sends eligible postbacks automatically, which can take a few minutes. To send postbacks immediately, you can transmit eligible development postbacks on-demand by tapping the Transmit Development Postbacks button.\n\nAdAttributionKit treats a postback as eligible for transmission after its conversion window elapses or you lock it by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/Postback\/updateConversionValue(_:)] API. The duration of the postback’s conversion window depends on whether you enable AdAttributionKit Developer Mode. For more information about Developer Mode, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.AdAttributionKit\/documentation\/AdAttributionKit\/testing-adattributionkit-with-developer-mode].\n\n## Clear development postbacks\n\nTapping Clear Development Postbacks deletes all development postbacks currently in the system, allowing you to return the device to a known starting point.",
