The sample trains a network for 300 iterations on a batch size of 40 images. You’ll see how to set up training of weights and biases using data sources, including how to initialize and update weights. You’ll also see how to validate the network using a test dataset.\n\nYou can use any dataset of your choice to train this model.  The following dataset works well for this purpose:\n\n[http:\/\/yann.lecun.com\/exdb\/mnist\/]\n\nPlease note that Apple does not own the copyright to this dataset nor makes any representations about the applicable terms of use for this dataset.\n\nIf you choose to use this dataset, the sample includes a script that downloads the dataset from that location and pass it as input to the model.\n\n### Configure the Sample Code Project\n\nBefore you run the sample code project in Xcode:",
