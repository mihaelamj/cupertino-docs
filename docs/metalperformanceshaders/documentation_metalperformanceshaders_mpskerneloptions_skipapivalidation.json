Turning on this option can result in undefined behavior if the requested operation cannot be completed for some reason. Most error states will be passed through to Metal, which may do nothing or abort the program if Metal API validation is turned on.",

This has a small but nonzero CPU cost. Setting this option, however, does not skip checks for memory allocation failure. Turning on this option can result in undefined behavior if the requested operation cannot be completed for some reason. Most error states will be passed through to Metal, which may do nothing or abort the program if Metal API validation is turned on.\n\n## Constants\n\n- **none**: The default option for the kernel. Kernels created with this option will not skip any API validation and will not use reduced precision.\n- **allowReducedPrecision**: When possible, kernels use a higher-precision data representation internally than the destination storage format to avoid excessive accumulation of computational rounding error in the result. This option advises the kernel that the destination storage format already has too much precision for what is ultimately required downstream, and the kernel may use reduced precision internally when it determines that a less precise result would yield better performance. When enabled, the performance win is often small and the precision of the result may vary by hardware and OS.\n- **disableInternalTiling**: Some kernels may automatically split up their work internally into multiple tiles. This improves performance on larger textures and reduces the amount of memory needed by the framework for temporary storage. However, if you are using your own tiling scheme to achieve similar results, your tile sizes and the framework’s choice of tile sizes may interfere with one another, causing the framework to subdivide your tiles for its own use inefficiently. Use this option to force the framework to process your data tile as a single chunk.\n- **insertDebugGroups**: Enables calling kernel encode methods.\n\n",
