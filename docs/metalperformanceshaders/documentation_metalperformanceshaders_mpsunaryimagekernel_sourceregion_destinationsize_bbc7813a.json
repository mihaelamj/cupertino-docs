This information may be needed if the source image is broken into multiple textures. The size of the full (untiled) destination image is provided. The region of the full (untiled) source image that will be read is returned. You can then piece together an appropriate texture containing that information for use in your tiled context.\n\nThis method will consult the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metalperformanceshaders\/documentation\/MetalPerformanceShaders\/MPSUnaryImageKernel\/offset] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.metalperformanceshaders\/documentation\/MetalPerformanceShaders\/MPSUnaryImageKernel\/clipRect] properties to determine the full region read by the function.
