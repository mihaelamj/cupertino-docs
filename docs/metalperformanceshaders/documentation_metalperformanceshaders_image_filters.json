This means that the same texture is used to hold both the input image and the result image. Operating in place is a great way to save memory, time, and energy. You can perform an in-place operation by using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metalperformanceshaders\/documentation\/MetalPerformanceShaders\/MPSUnaryImageKernel\/encode(commandBuffer:inPlaceTexture:fallbackCopyAllocator:)] method.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not always possible for kernels to run in place. Whether a particular kernel can operate in place can vary according to the hardware it is running on, the OS version, and the parameters and properties passed to it. You may not assume that because a kernel works in place today on a particular device that it will do so in the future.\n\nTo simplify error handling with failed in-place operation, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metalperformanceshaders\/documentation\/MetalPerformanceShaders\/MPSUnaryImageKernel\/encode(commandBuffer:inPlaceTexture:fallbackCopyAllocator:)] method takes an optional [doc:\/\/com.apple.metalperformanceshaders\/documentation\/MetalPerformanceShaders\/MPSCopyAllocator] object. It is used to create a new texture when in-place operation is not possible so as to allow the operation to proceed out of place in a reliable fashion instead. When this happens, the input texture is released and replaced with a new texture. To make use of the feature, you will need to write a copy allocator block.\n\nThe following code listing shows a minimal copy allocator implementation. For more information, see the [doc:\/\/com.apple.metalperformanceshaders\/documentation\/MetalPerformanceShaders\/MPSCopyAllocator] reference.\n\nListing 1. Minimal MPSCopyAllocator Implementation\n\n### Supported Pixel Formats for Image Kernels\n\nAll Metal Performance Shaders image kernels support source and destination textures with the following ordinary and packed pixel formats:\n\nSome compressed pixel formats can be used as source textures. They cannot be used as destination textures because they cannot be written to. Metal Performance Shaders image kernels support the following compression families:\n\nThe following Metal Performance Shaders image kernels also support source and destination textures with ordinary signed and unsigned integer pixel formats:\n\nThe ordinary signed and unsigned integer pixel formats supported by these image kernels:\n\nFor more information on pixel formats, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Metal\/MTLPixelFormat] and [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/metal\/capabilities\/].\n\n### Sample Code\n\nListing 2.
