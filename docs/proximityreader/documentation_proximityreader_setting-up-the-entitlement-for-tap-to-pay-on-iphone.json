Your project’s code signing settings might also require minor changes.\n\n\n\n### Add the Tap to Pay on iPhone capability to your App ID\n\nFollow these steps to update your App ID to include the necessary capability:\n\n1. Create an App ID for your app if you don’t already have one. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/manage-identifiers\/register-an-app-id].\n2. Sign in to your [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/] account and select Certificates, IDs & Profiles.\n3. Select Identifiers in the menu on the left.\n4. Select your app from the list.\n5. Click the Additional Capabilities tab.\n6. Enable the Tap to Pay on iPhone capability.\n7. Click the Save button.\n8. Create a new provisioning profile for the updated App ID. For more information, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/manage-profiles\/create-a-development-provisioning-profile].\n\n### Download the new provisioning profile\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to use the new provisioning profile to code sign your app:\n\n1. In Xcode, select your project in the Project navigator.\n2. In the project editor, click the Signing & Capabilities tab.\n3. Click All in the scope bar, and then deselect “Automatically manage signing”.\n4. Click the Provisioning Profile pop-up menu and choose Download Profile.\n5. Select your ProximityReader provisioning profile from the left column and click Select Profile.\n\n### Add an entitlements file\n\nIn Xcode, you need to create a file to specify the entitlements necessary for your app to use Tap to Pay on iPhone.\n\n\n\nTo create the entitlements file:\n\n1. In Xcode, select your project in the Project navigator.\n2. Choose File > New > File from Template, select Property List from the Resource section, and click Next.\n3. Enter `your_project.entitlements` as the filename, replacing `your_project` with the name of your project, and click Create.\n4. In the project editor, click the Build Settings tab.\n5.
