  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nTap to Pay on iPhone lets an app use the person’s iPhone to read contactless payment cards without any additional hardware. Merchants use your app to request payments from customers, and process the financial transactions using the back-end payment services you offer. Your app uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader] framework to read the payment method someone presents. You then pass that payment method and transaction details to the payment service provider you use to handle financial transactions.\n\nThe region or payment service provider may require a specific iOS version for merchants using Tap to Pay on iPhone. Make sure merchants are aware of any restrictions as part of your app materials.\n\n### Verify the current device supports Tap to Pay on iPhone\n\nBefore you attempt to use Tap to Pay on iPhone, verify that the current device supports the feature. Tap to Pay on iPhone is available only on iPhone, starting with iPhone XS. To determine if the feature is available on the current device, check the value of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/isSupported] static property before you do anything else. If the feature is available, create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader] object to manage further interactions and to start sessions to read payment cards.\n\nThe following example shows a custom type that allocates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader] object only if the current device supports Tap to Pay on iPhone. Other methods of this type throw errors if the reader object isn’t available.\n\n### Display the Terms and Conditions interface to the merchant\n\nThe first time a merchant runs your app, present an interface for them to accept the Terms and Conditions for Tap to Pay on iPhone. Accepting the terms and conditions registers that merchant with Tap to Pay on iPhone, and allows them to begin using the feature. Merchants need to accept the terms and conditions only once for a given merchant identifier, even if they use the feature on a different device.\n\nTo display the Terms and Conditions for Tap to Pay on iPhone, get a JSON web token (JWT) from your payment service provider that includes the merchant’s unique identifier. Store the token in a secure location so you can access it later. Pass the token to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/linkAccount(using:)] method of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader] object. This method presents a system sheet that displays the Terms and Conditions for Tap to Pay for iPhone.\n\nThe following code extends the `MyPaymentProcessor` class from the previous example with an additional function to present the terms and conditions:\n\n### Create a session to read payment cards from the current device\n\nEach time your app launches, create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession] to handle the reading of payment card information. You create this session using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/prepare(using:)] method of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader] object. The initial configuration of the device can take up to two minutes, but subsequent requests typically take only a few seconds. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/events] property provides an asynchronous stream of events that you can use to display a progress UI to the merchant.\n\nThe following example configures a task to monitor progress events and then calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/prepare(using:)] method to configure the device. After the successful configuration of the device, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/prepare(using:)] method returns a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession] object that you can use to start reading payment cards. If an error occurs, the method throws a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderError] for you to handle.\n\nIf the merchant closes your app while configuration is in progress, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/prepare(using:)] method throws a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderError\/serviceConnectionError] error, but configuration continues in the background. When your app returns to the foreground, call [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/prepare(using:)] again to finish the previous configuration process and retrieve a new session object.\n\n### Present the UI to request someone’s payment details\n\nOnce you have a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession] you can use it to display a sheet to the merchant’s customer asking them for their payment method. The sheet displays a standard system payment UI and waits for the customer to present their card or other payment method to the merchant’s iPhone. As soon as the iPhone collects the payment information, the sheet closes and the session returns a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReadResult] to your app. If the sheet wasn’t able to collect a payment information, it returns a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession\/ReadError] to let you know that a problem occurred. Make sure your app handles the different types of errors that can occur for transactions.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReadResult] structure contains important information that your payment service provider needs to complete the transaction. For each transaction, send the encrypted data in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReadResult\/paymentCardData] property to your payment service provider. Send this data regardless of whether or not the transaction completed successfully. The encrypted data is valid for only 60 seconds, so send it immediately to your provider.\n\nThe following example shows a template for a function that initiates a payment request for a session. The method creates a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardTransactionRequest] with the transaction amount and uses the session to read the customer’s payment card. The method also monitors card reader events asynchronously and provides an appropriate response. For example, you might use events for your own analytics or to take appropriate actions.\n\nCatch any errors that happen during a payment read operation and take appropriate action. For more information about the errors that can occur, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession\/ReadError].\n\n### Capture PIN information as part of a transaction\n\nSome cards require the customer to enter an associated personal identification number (PIN) to complete a transaction. If the current card requires a PIN, the system UI automatically asks the person to enter it after reading the card. After the person enters the PIN and completes the transaction, the session returns a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReadResult] structure that contains the encrypted PIN data along with the rest of the transaction data.\n\nA card issuer can also require a person to enter a PIN to complete a transaction. After reading the card and sending the transaction data to your payment service provider, you might get a subsequent request for the person’s PIN data. Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession\/capturePIN(using:cardReaderTransactionID:)] method to display a new sheet to ask for the person’s PIN. Upon successful completion of this method, the session returns a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReadResult] with both the encrypted payment card data and the encrypted PIN data.\n\nIf a read operation requires a separate PIN capture, the payment service provider must provide a secure PIN token for that specific operation. Use this token to create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession\/PINToken] structure and display the capture UI. The following method captures the PIN for a previous read operation.\n\n### Turn off card reader functionality when not in use\n\nIf payment processing is one of several features of your app, you can turn off the card reader functionality when not in use. The simplest way to turn off this functionality is to deallocate the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession] objects you currently have. The following method sets the `reader` and `session` variables of the previously defined `MyPaymentProcessor` class to `nil`:\n\nWhen you delete the reader and session objects, the system clears out the current session information but retains some system-level details and configuration data. Creating a new reader and session later requires a network connection, because the reader requires information on the server to create any new sessions.",

Other methods of this type throw errors if the reader object isn’t available.\n\n```\npublic class MyPaymentProcessor {\n    \n    var reader: PaymentCardReader?\n    \n    init() {\n        guard PaymentCardReader.isSupported else {\n            \/\/ This device doesn't support Tap to Pay on iPhone.\n            return\n        }\n        reader = PaymentCardReader()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Display the Terms and Conditions interface to the merchant\n\nThe first time a merchant runs your app, present an interface for them to accept the Terms and Conditions for Tap to Pay on iPhone. Accepting the terms and conditions registers that merchant with Tap to Pay on iPhone, and allows them to begin using the feature. Merchants need to accept the terms and conditions only once for a given merchant identifier, even if they use the feature on a different device.\n\nTo display the Terms and Conditions for Tap to Pay on iPhone, get a JSON web token (JWT) from your payment service provider that includes the merchant’s unique identifier.

This method presents a system sheet that displays the Terms and Conditions for Tap to Pay for iPhone.\n\nThe following code extends the `MyPaymentProcessor` class from the previous example with an additional function to present the terms and conditions:\n\n```\nextension MyPaymentProcessor {\n       \n    public func presentTermsAndConditions(tokenData: String) async throws {\n        let token = PaymentCardReader.Token(rawValue: tokenData)\n        \n        \/\/ Display the UI only if the merchant hasn’t accepted the terms and conditions yet. \n        if !reader.isAccountLinked(using:token) {\n            \/\/ Confirm that the user is an admin. Otherwise, display a message that\n            \/\/ states only admins may accept the Terms and Conditions.\n            do {\n                try await reader?.linkAccount(using: token)\n            } catch {\n                \/\/ Handle any errors that occur during linking.\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Create a session to read payment cards from the current device\n\nEach time your app launches, create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession] to handle the reading of payment card information.

The following method sets the `reader` and `session` variables of the previously defined `MyPaymentProcessor` class to `nil`:\n\n```\nextension MyPaymentProcessor {\n    \n    public func cleanup() {\n        session = nil\n        reader = nil\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you delete the reader and session objects, the system clears out the current session information but retains some system-level details and configuration data. Creating a new reader and session later requires a network connection, because the reader requires information on the server to create any new sessions.\n\n## Payment card reader\n\n- **Setting up Tap to Pay on iPhone**: Request and configure the required entitlement to support Tap to Pay on iPhone.\n- **PaymentCardReader**: An object you use to configure Tap to Pay on iPhone on the current device.\n- **PaymentCardReaderSession**: The object you use to start reading a contactless payment or loyalty card.\n\n",
