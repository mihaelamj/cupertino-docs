See the discussion for details of how this parameter affects the return value.\n- **eventHandler**: A handler you use to receive request-related updates. The handler handler has no return value and takes a [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReaderSession\/Event] as a parameter. Use the event parameter to determine what happened.\n\n## Return Value\n\nEither [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReadResult], [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/VASReadResult], or both when the read operation was successful.\n\n## Discussion\n\nCall this method to read either a contactless payment card or a loyalty card.
