To generate a reader token:\n\n1. Fetch the device’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/MobileDocumentReader\/Configuration-swift.struct\/readerInstanceIdentifier].\n2. Send the reader instance identifier to your server.\n3. On your server, create a JWT containing the device’s reader instance identifier, along with your brand and key IDs from [https:\/\/register.apple.com\/services\/login?returnTo=\/signin\/id-verifier].\n4. Sign the JWT with your server’s private signing key and return the token to your app.\n\nAfter creating the reader token, confirm the validity of the token authorization by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/MobileDocumentReader\/prepare(using:)].
