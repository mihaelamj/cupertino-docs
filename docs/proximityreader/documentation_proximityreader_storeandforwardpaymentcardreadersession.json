Instead, you obtain one by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader\/prepareStoreAndForward()] method of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.ProximityReader\/documentation\/ProximityReader\/PaymentCardReader] object, which returns a session after the successful configuration of the device.\n\nMaintain a strong reference to a session object for the duration of the card-reading process. You may use the same session object to perform multiple read operations, but you may perform only one read operation at a time",
