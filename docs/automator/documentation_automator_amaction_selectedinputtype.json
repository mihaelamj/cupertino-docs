For example, your action may have the ability to accept files and folders, or documents, depending on how it’s configured and what action precedes it in the workflow.\n\nThe input types the action supports are specified in the action’s `Info.plist` file. By default, this property defaults to first input type in the `Info.plist` file.\n\nThrough its interface, the action can could be configured to allow the user to specify the type of input the action should accept. For example, a Contacts action may allow the user to configure whether the action accepts people or groups. In cases like this, set this property value to explicitly indicate the input type the action accepts. Setting this value to accurately reflect the appropriate type of input helps Automator determine whether the input the action receives is compatible, or can be made compatible, with the action.",
