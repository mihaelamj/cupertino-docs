Automator invokes this method when the action is about to complete its run phase.\n\n## Controlling the Action\n\n- **run(withInput:)**: Requests the action to perform its task using the specified input.\n- **runAsynchronously(withInput:)**: Causes Automator to wait for notification that the action has completed execution, which allows the action to perform an asynchronous operation.\n- **finishRunningWithError(_:)**: Causes the action to stop running and return an error, which, in turn, causes the workflow to stop.\n- **stop()**: Stops the action from running.\n- **reset()**: Resets the action to its initial state.\n\n",
