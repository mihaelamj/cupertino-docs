Pausing updates gives the system the opportunity to save power in situations where the user’s location isn’t likely to be changing. For example, if the activity type is [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLActivityType\/automotiveNavigation] and no location changes have occurred recently, the system might power down radios until the system detects movement again.\n\nAfter a pause occurs, it’s your responsibility to restart location services again when you determine that they’re needed.
