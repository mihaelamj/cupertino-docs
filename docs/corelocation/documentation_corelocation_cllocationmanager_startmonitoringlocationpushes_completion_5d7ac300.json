Devices need an Internet connection to receive the token. Your completion block receives the token if the call succeeds, otherwise it receives error information. If a compatible iPad or iPhone app calls this method when running in visionOS, the method does nothing.\n\nTo use location push notifications, your app must have the `com.apple.developer.location.push` entitlement.
