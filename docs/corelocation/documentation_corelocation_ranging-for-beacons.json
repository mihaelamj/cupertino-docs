Ranging is the process of reading the characteristics of a beacon region, such as signal strength, advertising interval, and measured power.\n\nThis sample code project configures a device to act as a beacon, and configures a device to use ranging to find surrounding beacons. Use two iOS devices to run the sample, with one acting as a beacon, and the other ranging for the beacon.\n\n### Configure a Device to Act as a Beacon\n\nRun the sample app on the first iOS device. Select the option to Configure a Beacon. The project hardcodes a default value for the UUID that can be changed in `ConfigureBeaconViewController.swift`.\n\nOptionally modify the major and minor value for the beacon, then select the Enabled switch on the configuration screen to start advertising.\n\n`ConfigureBeaconViewController.swift` contains a view controller object that configures the iOS device running this app to act as a beacon.  The `configureBeaconRegion()` method sets up the region and starts advertising itself.\n\n### Configure a Device to Range for Beacons\n\nUsing a second iOS device, run the sample app and tap Range for Beacons to scan for beacons. Add a UUID to range for by tapping the Add button in the upper corner of the screen. The hardcoded UUID appears by default.\n\n`RangeBeaconViewController.swift` contains a view controller object that ranges a set of beacon regions that the user adds.
