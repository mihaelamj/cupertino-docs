If an existing region with the same identifier is already being monitored by the app, the old region is replaced by the new one. The regions you add using this method are shared by all location manager objects in your app and stored in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager\/monitoredRegions] property.\n\nRegion events are delivered to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didEnterRegion:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didExitRegion:)] methods of your delegate. If there is an error, the location manager calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:monitoringDidFailFor:withError:)] method of your delegate instead.\n\nAn app can register up to 20 regions at a time. In order to report region changes in a timely manner, the region monitoring service requires network connectivity.\n\nIn iOS 6, regions with a radius between 1 and 400 meters work better on iPhone 4S or later devices. (In iOS 5, regions with a radius between 1 and 150 meters work better on iPhone 4S and later devices.) On these devices, an app can expect to receive the appropriate region entered or region exited notification within 3 to 5 minutes on average, if not sooner.\n\nIf a compatible iPad or iPhone app calls this method when running in visionOS, the method does nothing.",
