The ground floor of a building is always represented by the value `0`. Floors above the ground floor are represented by positive integers, so a value of `1` represents the floor above ground level, a value of `2` represents two floors above ground level, and so on. Floors below the ground floor are represented by corresponding negative integers, with a value of -1 representing the floor immediately below ground level and so on.\n\nIt is erroneous to use the user’s level in a building as an estimate of altitude.",
