Expiration is postponed while your app is actively in use. For example, expiration is postponed while your app in the foreground, and while a Continuous Background Location session is active with the background location indicator enabled. This approach to expiration allows apps to provide experiences that require full accuracy, such as fitness and navigation apps, even if the user doesn’t grant persistent access for full accuracy.\n\nThe completion closure is guaranteed to be called after the request is completed, which includes the user granting access, the user declining, or an error that prevented displaying the prompt. The closure is always called in the same threading context as [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate] methods. If the prompt was successfully displayed to the user, the callback’s `error` parameter is `nil`.\n\nThe request always fails with a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLError-swift.struct\/Code\/promptDeclined] error in the following cases:\n\nIf the closure is called with an error, log the error for debugging purposes, and retry the request again the next time the user performs the action that caused you to request precise location information.",

The value for this key is an app-provided string that describes the reason for accessing location data with full accuracy.  To localize a usage description, add an entry to your `InfoPlist.strings` file with the same key you provide for this parameter.\n- **completion**: A closure to execute after authorization status changes. This closure takes a single `error` parameter, which is `nil` if the prompt was displayed to the user, or an error object describing why the prompt couldn’t be displayed.\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n\nAfter the user gives permission for your app to use location data with full accuracy, your app can access that data in the foreground or in the background, until its permission automatically expires.
