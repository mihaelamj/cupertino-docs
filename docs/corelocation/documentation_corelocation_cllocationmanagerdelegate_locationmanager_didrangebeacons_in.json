If `beacons` is empty, you can assume that no beacons matching the specified region are in range. When a specific beacon is no longer in `beacons`, that beacon is no longer received by the device. You can use the information in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLBeacon] objects to determine the range of each beacon and its identifying information.\n- **region**: The region object containing the parameters that were used to locate the beacons.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe location manager calls this method when a new set of beacons becomes available in the specified region or when a beacon goes out of range. The location manager also calls this method when the range of a beacon changes; for example, when a beacon gets closer.\n\n## Receiving beacon-related updates\n\n- **locationManager(_:didRange:satisfying:)**: Tells the delegate that the location manager detected at least one beacon that satisfies the provided constraint.\n- **locationManager(_:didFailRangingFor:error:)**: Tells the delegate that the location manager couldn’t detect any beacons that satisfy the provided constraint.\n- **locationManager(_:rangingBeaconsDidFailFor:withError:)**: Tells the delegate that an error occurred while gathering ranging information for a set of beacons.\n\n",
