This authorization process involves a one-time interruption, during which the system prompts the device owner to grant or deny your app’s request for location data. After the initial interruption, the system stores your app’s authorization status and doesn’t prompt again.\n\nTo help people understand why you need location data, make authorization requests only when someone engages a part of your app that requires that data. Making the request immediately before it’s needed increases the likelihood of the person granting the request. If you make a request immediately at app launch, or in a part of your app that doesn’t clearly use location data, the person might misinterpret your intent and deny the request.\n\n### Choose the access level you need\n\nBefore you place an authorization request, choose the level of access your app needs.

The alert includes a usage description string that explains why you want access to location data. You provide this string in your app’s Information Property List and use it to inform people about how your app uses location data.\n\nCore Location supports different usage strings for each access level. You must include a usage description string for When in Use access. If your app supports Always access, provide an additional string explaining why you want the elevated privileges. The following table lists the keys to include in your app’s Information Property List and when to include them.\n\nAdd all usage description keys to your app’s Information Property List before you make any authorization requests. Authorization requests fail immediately if the required keys aren’t present.\n\n### Make authorization requests and respond to status changes\n\nBefore you start any location services, check your app’s current authorization status and place an authorization request if needed.

However, a newly configured [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager] object also reports your app’s current authorization status to its delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization(_:)] method automatically. You might use that method to place an authorization request when the current status is [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLAuthorizationStatus\/notDetermined].

This authorization process involves a one-time interruption, during which the system prompts the device owner to grant or deny your app’s request for location data.

Making the request immediately before it’s needed increases the likelihood of the person granting the request. If you make a request immediately at app launch, or in a part of your app that doesn’t clearly use location data, the person might misinterpret your intent and deny the request.\n\n### Choose the access level you need\n\nBefore you place an authorization request, choose the level of access your app needs. Core Location supports two authorization levels:\n\n- **When in Use** authorization makes location updates available only when someone uses your app. This authorization is the preferred choice, because it has better privacy and battery life implications.\n- **Always** authorization makes location updates available at any time, and lets the system launch your app quietly to handle some updates. Request this access level only when necessary on other platforms. For example, request it if your app delivers time-sensitive responses to location changes automatically, or implements a location push service app extension. This access level isn’t available when running in visionOS.\n\nThe definition of when an app is in use depends on the platform:\n\n- On iOS, an app is in use when it’s in the foreground and for a short time when it transitions from the foreground to the background. If you enable background location updates, an app with When in Use authorization continues to run in the background when location services are active; if location services aren’t running, the normal suspension rules apply. If the system terminates the app or the app isn’t running, the system doesn’t launch an app with When in Use authorization to deliver new updates; it does launch an app with Always authorization for some types of location updates.\n- On macOS, When in Use and Always authorizations are functionally equivalent. Because macOS apps continue to run in the background after their initial launch, they are always in use. If you create your Mac app using Mac Catalyst, request authorization based on the needs of your iOS app.\n- On watchOS, complications can receive location updates, but the watchOS app must run at least once so it can request authorization to access location data. If an app’s complication is on the current watch face, the system treats that complication as if it’s in use and delivers location updates to it. The system doesn’t launch watchOS apps, even if they have Always access.\n- On visionOS, an app is in use when someone is looking at it, and for a short time after the person stops looking at it.\n\n\n\nRegardless of which access level you choose, you can start any location services available on the current device and achieve the same results. Access levels primarily determine how your app receives updates when it isn’t running. The following table summarizes the differences between access levels.\n\n\n\nFor information about how to handle location updates in the background, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/handling-location-updates-in-the-background].\n\n### Provide descriptions of how you use location services\n\nThe first time you make an authorization request, the system displays an alert asking the person to grant or deny the request.
