Your app receives events, including authorization changes, by observing asynchronous sequences from [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationUpdate] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLMonitor-6ynwz].\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Configuring your app to use location services**: Prepare your app to start collecting location data.\n- **Supporting live updates in SwiftUI and Mac Catalyst apps**: Enable background events by adding lifecycle event support.\n- **CLLocationManager**: The object you use to start and stop the delivery of location-related events to your app.\n- **CLBackgroundActivitySession**: An object that manages a visual indicator that keeps your app in use in the background, allowing it to receive updates or events.\n- **CLLocationUpdate**: A structure that contains the location information the framework delivers with each update.\n- **Adopting live updates in Core Location**: Simplify location delivery using asynchronous events in Swift.\n- **Monitoring location changes with Core Location**: Define boundaries and act on user location updates.\n\n## Authorization\n\n- **Requesting authorization to use location services**: Obtain authorization to use location services and manage changes to your app’s authorization status.\n- **Suspending authorization requests**: Defer the system’s authorization request dialog until your app is ready.\n- **CLAuthorizationStatus**: Constants that indicate the app’s authorization to use location services.\n- **CLAccuracyAuthorization**: Constants that indicate the level of location accuracy the app has authorization to use.\n- **NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription**: A message that tells people why the app is requesting access to their location information at all times.\n- **NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription**: A message that tells people why the app is requesting access to their location information while the app is running in the foreground.\n- **NSLocationUsageDescription**: A message that tells people why the app is requesting access to their location information.\n- **NSLocationDefaultAccuracyReduced**: A Boolean value that indicates whether the app requests reduced location accuracy by default.\n- **NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription**: A message that tells people why the app is requesting access to their location at all times.\n\n## Monitoring\n\n- **CLMonitor**: An object that monitors the conditions you add to it.\n\n## Location updates\n\n- **Getting the current location of a device**: Start location services and provide information the system needs to optimize power usage for those services.\n- **Handling location updates in the background**: Configure your app to receive location updates when it isn’t running in the foreground.\n- **Creating a location push service extension**: Add and configure an extension to enable your location-sharing app to access a user’s location in response to a request from another user.\n- **CLLocation**: The latitude, longitude, and course information reported by the system.\n- **CLLocationCoordinate2D**: The latitude and longitude associated with a location, specified using the WGS 84 reference frame.\n- **CLFloor**: The floor of a building on which the user’s device is located.\n- **CLVisit**: Information about the user’s location during a specific period of time.\n- **CLLocationSourceInformation**: Information about the source that provides a location.\n- **Monitoring location changes with Core Location**: Define boundaries and act on user location updates.\n- **CLServiceSession**\n\n## Region monitoring\n\n- **Monitoring the user’s proximity to geographic regions**: Use condition monitoring to determine when the user enters or leaves a geographic region.\n- **CLRegion**: A base class representing an area that can be monitored.\n\n## iBeacon\n\n- **Ranging for Beacons**: Configure a device to act as a beacon and to detect surrounding beacons.\n- **Determining the proximity to an iBeacon device**: Detect beacons and determine the relative distance to them.\n- **Turning an iOS device into an iBeacon device**: Broadcast iBeacon signals from an iOS device.\n- **CLBeacon**: Information about an observed iBeacon device and its relative distance to a person’s device.\n- **CLCondition**: The abstract base class for all other monitor conditions.\n\n## Compass headings\n\n- **Getting heading and course information**: Use a device’s orientation and course information for navigation.\n- **CLHeading**: The orientation of the user’s device, relative to true or magnetic north.\n\n## Geocoding\n\n- **Converting between coordinates and user-friendly place names**: Convert between a latitude and longitude pair and a more user-friendly description of that location.\n- **Converting a user’s location to a descriptive placemark**: Transform the user’s location that displays on a map into an informative textual description by reverse geocoding.\n- **CLGeocoder**: An interface for converting between geographic coordinates and place names.\n- **CLPlacemark**: A user-friendly description of a geographic coordinate, often containing the name of the place, its address, and other relevant information.\n\n## Location push service extension\n\n- **Location Push Service Extension**: An entitlement to enable a location-sharing app to query someone’s location in response to a push notification.\n- **CLLocationPushServiceExtension**: The interface you adopt in the type that acts as the main entry point for a Location Push Service Extension.\n- **CLLocationPushServiceError**: Error codes the location manager returns if starting to monitor for location push notifications fails.\n- **CLLocationPushServiceErrorDomain**: The domain for Location Push Service Extension errors.\n- **CLLocationPushServiceError.Code**: Error codes the location manager returns if starting to monitor for location push notifications fails.\n\n## Errors\n\n- **CLError**: A Core Location error.\n- **kCLErrorDomain**: The domain for Core Location errors.\n- **kCLErrorUserInfoAlternateRegionKey**: A key in the user information dictionary of an error relating to a delayed region-monitoring response.\n\n## Deprecated\n\n- **Deprecated**\n\n## Reference\n\n- **Core Location Constants**: This document describes the constants found in the Core Location framework.\n- **Core Location Functions**: The Core Location framework provides functions to help you work with coordinate values.\n\n",
