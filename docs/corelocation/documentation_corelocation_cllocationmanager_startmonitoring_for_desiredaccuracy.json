This parameter must not be `nil`.\n- **accuracy**: The distance past the border (measured in meters) at which to generate notifications. You can use this value to prevent the delivery of multiple notifications when the user is close to the border’s edge.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou must call this method separately for each region you want to monitor.
