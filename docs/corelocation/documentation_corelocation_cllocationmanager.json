Use a location-manager object to configure, start, and stop location services. You might use these services to:\n\n- Track large or small changes in the user’s current location with a configurable degree of accuracy.\n- Report heading changes from the onboard compass.\n- Monitor geographical regions of interest and generate events when someone enters or leaves those regions.\n- Report the range to nearby Bluetooth beacons.\n\nCreate one or more location-manager objects in your app and use them where you need location data. After you create a location-manager object, configure it so that Core Location knows how often to report location changes. In particular, configure the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager\/distanceFilter] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager\/desiredAccuracy] properties with values that reflect your app’s needs.\n\nA [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager] object reports all location-related updates to its [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager\/delegate] object, which is an object that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate] protocol. Assign the delegate immediately when you configure your location manager, because the system reports the app’s authorization status to the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManagerDidChangeAuthorization(_:)] method after the location manager finishes initializing itself.  Core Location calls the methods of your delegate object using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/RunLoop] of the thread on which you initialized the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager] object. That thread must itself have an active [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/RunLoop], like the one found in your app’s main thread.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/configuring-your-app-to-use-location-services].\n\n## Determining the availability of services\n\n-
