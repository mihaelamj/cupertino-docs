  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nCall this method in situations where you want location data with GPS accuracy but do not need to process that data right away. If your app is in the background and the system is able to optimize its power usage, the location manager tells the GPS hardware to store new locations internally until the specified distance or timeout conditions are met. When one or both criteria are met, the location manager ends deferred locations by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didFinishDeferredUpdatesWithError:)] method of its delegate and delivers the cached locations to the  [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didUpdateLocations:)] method. If your app is in the foreground, the location manager does not defer the deliver of events but does monitor for the specified criteria. If your app moves to the background before the criteria are met, the location manager may begin deferring the delivery of events.\n\nStart the delivery of location updates before calling this method. The most common place to call this method is in your delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didUpdateLocations:)] method. After processing any new locations, call this method if you want to defer future updates until the distance or time criteria are met. If new events arrive and your app is in the background, the events are cached and their delivery is deferred appropriately.\n\nYour delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didFinishDeferredUpdatesWithError:)] method is called exactly once for each time you call this method. If you call this method twice in succession, the location manager cancels the previous deferral before starting the new one. Therefore, you should keep track of whether updates are currently deferred and avoid calling this method multiple times in succession. If you want to change the deferral criteria for any reason, and therefore call this method again, be prepared to receive a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLError-swift.struct\/Code\/deferredCanceled] error in your delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didFinishDeferredUpdatesWithError:)] method.\n\nAfter calling this method, the location manager may deliver location updates even if the specified distance and timeout criteria are not met. For example, if the caches used to store deferred samples become full, the location manager may deliver the cached samples so it can collect new ones. The delivery of samples does not automatically end deferred mode for your app. The location manager resumes deferred mode when it is able to do so.\n\nDeferred updates are delivered only when the system enters a low power state. Deferred updates do not occur during debugging because Xcode prevents your app from sleeping and thus prevents the system from entering that low power state.",

To specify an unlimited distance, pass the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationDistanceMax] constant.\n- **timeout**: The amount of time (in seconds) from the current time that must pass before event delivery resumes.
