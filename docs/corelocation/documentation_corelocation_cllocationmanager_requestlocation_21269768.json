Calling it causes the location manager to obtain a location fix (which may take several seconds) and call the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didUpdateLocations:)] method with the result. The location fix is obtained at the accuracy level indicated by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager\/desiredAccuracy] property. Only one location fix is reported to the delegate, after which location services are stopped. If a location fix cannot be determined in a timely manner, the location manager calls the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didFailWithError:)] method instead and reports a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLError-swift.struct\/Code\/locationUnknown] error.\n\nUse this method when you want the user’s current location but do not need to leave location services running. This method starts location services long enough to return a result or report an error and then stops them again.
