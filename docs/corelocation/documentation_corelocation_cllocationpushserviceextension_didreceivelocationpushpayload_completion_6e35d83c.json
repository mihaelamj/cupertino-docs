Use your implementation of this method to request the device’s current location and do something with that information. For example, a location-sharing app might send the location back to a server to update the person’s current location.\n\nWhen you add a location push service app extension to your project, the Xcode template includes an implementation of this method for you to modify. The template uses this method to store the completion block and initialize a [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager] instance. Process the result of your location query in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate] methods.\n\nStore the completion block and call it after you finish processing the location request.

This block has no return value and no parameters.\n\nExecute this block as quickly as possible after you finish the location-related task. If you take too long to execute this block, the system calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationPushServiceExtension\/serviceExtensionWillTerminate()] method as a warning. If you still don’t call the block in a timely manner, the system terminates your app extension.\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n\nWhen the system receives a location push notification that targets your app, it runs your app extension and calls this method.
