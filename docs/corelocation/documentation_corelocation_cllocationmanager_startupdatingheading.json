If heading information is not supported, calling this method has no effect and does not result in the delivery of events to your delegate.\n\nCalling this method several times in succession does not automatically result in new events being generated. Calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager\/stopUpdatingHeading()] in between, however, does cause a new initial event to be sent the next time you call this method.\n\nIf you start this service and your app is suspended, the system stops the delivery of events until your app starts running again (either in the foreground or background). If your app is terminated, the delivery of new heading events stops altogether and must be restarted by your code when the app is relaunched.\n\nHeading events are delivered to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didUpdateHeading:)] method of your delegate.
