The value `0` means the device is pointed toward true north, `90` means it is pointed due east, `180` means it is pointed due south, and so on. A negative value indicates that the heading could not be determined.\n\nIn iOS 3.x and earlier, the value in this property is always measured relative to the top of the device in a portrait orientation, regardless of the device’s actual physical or interface orientation. In iOS 4.0 and later, the value is measured relative to the heading orientation specified by the location manager.
