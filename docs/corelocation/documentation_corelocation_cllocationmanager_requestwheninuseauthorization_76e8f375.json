The user prompt contains the text from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription] key in your app `Info.plist` file, and the presence of that key is required when calling this method. The user prompt displays the following options, which determine the authorization your app can receive.\n\nAfter the user makes a selection and determines the status, the location manager delivers the results to the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didChangeAuthorization:)] method. If the initial authorization status is anything other than [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLAuthorizationStatus\/notDetermined], this method does nothing and doesn’t call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManagerDelegate\/locationManager(_:didChangeAuthorization:)] method.\n\nIf the user’s choice grants When In Use authorization to your app, your app can start any location service and is eligible to receive the results while it’s in use. If the user’s choice grants temporary When In Use authorization, the authorization expires when the app is no longer in use, reverting to Not Determined status ([doc:\/\/com.apple.corelocation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLAuthorizationStatus\/notDetermined]).
