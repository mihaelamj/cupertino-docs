This method takes longer to return than [doc:\/\/com.apple.Translation\/documentation\/Translation\/TranslationSession\/translate(batch:)], but it has the advantage of not having to map translation requests to responses. The responses return in the same order the requests are sent.\n\nIf the required languages for translation have already downloaded and the source language is clear, this function returns results without showing any further prompts to the person.\n\nIf the source or target language aren’t installed, the framework asks the person for permission to download the languages. During download a progress indicator displays. After the download completes, the framework performs the translation.\n\nIf the `sourceLanguage` is `nil` and the framework can’t detect the source language from the content, the framework prompts the person to choose the source language.\n\nThe framework only supports string translations of the same language. The strings must either match the `sourceLanguage` you set in the configuration, or if the `sourceLanguage` is `nil`, be of the same language.\n\nThis function throws an `Error` if:\n\nIf a person dismisses the progress view while the languages download, the system throws a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/CocoaError\/Code\/userCancelled] error, and the languages continue to download in the background.",
