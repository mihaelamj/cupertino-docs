For example, your string might resemble `maps.com.mywebsite` or `maps.com.mycompany.mywebsite`.\n\nTo create a Maps ID, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account] and log in with your Apple Developer credentials.\n2. Under [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/ios\/certificate], click Identifiers in the sidebar.\n3. At the top of the identifiers list, click the Add Identifiers button (+).\n4. On the following page, select the Maps IDs checkbox, and then click the Continue button at the top of the page.\n5. Enter a string for the description. This can be your app name, team name, project name, or anything that conveys context and is meaningful to you.\n6. Enter a reverse-domain-style string for the identifier (for example, `maps.com.mycompany.mywebsite`), then click Continue.\n7. Review the information, then click Register.\n\nIf you have multiple environments, such as a development environment and a production environment, it’s good practice to create separate Maps IDs and keys for each environment. That way, if a key you use in production becomes compromised, revoking it doesn’t affect your UAT or test environments.\n\n### Obtain a MapKit JS private key\n\nAfter you create a Maps ID, the next steps are to create a private key, add the MapKit JS service to this key, and associate it with a Maps ID:\n\n1. In [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account\/ios\/certificate], click Keys in the sidebar, then click the Keys + button at the top of the keys list.\n2. Under Key Name, enter a unique name for the key.\n3. Below that, select the checkbox next to MapKit JS. Note that the MapKit JS checkbox isn’t in an enabled state until you create a Maps ID.\n4. Near the top right of the page, click Configure. On the next page, choose a Maps ID to associate to this key from the pop-up menu, then click Save.\n5. Click Continue, review the key configuration, then click Register.\n6. Optionally, click Download to download the key. The private key is available to download a single time. If the Download button isn’t in an enabled state, you previously downloaded the key associated with this identifier.\n7. Click Done.\n\nAfter executing these steps, you have a private key that you can use to sign tokens, and you can begin [doc:\/\/com.apple.applemapsserverapi\/documentation\/AppleMapsServerAPI\/creating-and-using-tokens-with-maps-server-api].\n\n\n\nThe private key doesn’t expire, but you can revoke it. Revoking a key makes it invalid and affects calls to the MapKit JS API. If you lose a key or if someone else starts using your key, revoke it.
