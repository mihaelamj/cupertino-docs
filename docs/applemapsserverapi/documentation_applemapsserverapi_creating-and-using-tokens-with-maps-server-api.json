A Maps token has two sections, a header and a payload. The header describes the token and the cryptographic operations applied to the payload. The payload contains a set of cryptographically signed claims.\n\nConstruct a token with these required fields in the header:\n\n- `alg` — The algorithm you use to encrypt the token. Use the `ES256` algorithm to encrypt your token.\n- `kid` — A 10-character key identifier that provides the ID of the private key that you obtain from your Apple Developer account.\n- `typ` — A type parameter that you set to `\"JWT\"`.\n\nIn the payload section of the token, include the following claims:\n\n- `iss` — The issuer of the token. This is a 10-character Team ID obtained from your Apple Developer account.\n- `iat` — The Issued At registered claim key. The value of this claim indicates the token creation time, in terms of the number of seconds since UNIX Epoch, in UTC.\n- `exp` — The Expiration Time registered claim key. The value of this claim indicates when the token expires, in terms of the number of seconds since UNIX Epoch, in UTC.\n\nTo locate your Team ID, sign in to your [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/account], and click Membership in the sidebar. Your Team ID appears in the Membership information section under the team name. Generate your token by signing it with your private key.\n\nWhen decoded, a token for use with Maps Server API has the following format:\n\n```other\n{\n    \"alg\": \"ES256\",\n    \"kid\": \"ABC123DEFG\",\n    \"typ\": \"JWT\"\n}\n{\n    \"iss\": \"DEF123GHIJ\",\n    \"iat\": 1437179036,\n    \"exp\": 1493298100,\n    \"origin\": \"*.example.com\"\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about Maps tokens, see the [https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7519].
