To create a Maps ID and private key, follow the steps in [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppleMapsServerAPI\/creating-a-maps-identifier-and-a-private-key].\n\nIn the `MapsApiClientDemo.java` file, edit the `createJwt()` method to set the `teamId`, `keyId`, and `key` variables to the values you obtained from your Apple Developer portal account.\n\n### Run the sample\n\nTo run the sample, enter the following commands in Terminal while in the `server-api-examples` directory:\n\n```\n% gradle wrapper\n% .\/gradlew clean run\n```\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Creating and using tokens with Maps Server API**: Sign JSON Web Tokens to use Maps Server API and debug common signing errors.\n- **Creating a Maps identifier and a private key**: Create a Maps identifier and a private key before generating tokens for MapKit JS.\n- **Generate a Maps token**: Returns a JWT maps access token that you use to call the service API.\n- **Debugging an Invalid token**: Inspect the JavaScript console logs, the token, and events to determine why a token is invalid.\n- **Common objects**: Understand the common JSON objects that API responses contain.\n\n",
