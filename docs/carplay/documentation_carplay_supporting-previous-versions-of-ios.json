The framework also provides new templates that you can use to build your app’s user interface.\n\nSome of the new app categories supersede existing ones, such as audio and communication. Using the proper combination of frameworks and entitlements, you can ensure that your app is compatible with iOS 13 and earlier, and iOS 14 and later. To learn about requesting entitlements for your CarPlay-enabled app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.carplay\/documentation\/CarPlay\/requesting-carplay-entitlements].\n\n### Add Backward Compatibility to Audio Apps\n\nIn iOS 14 and later, the CarPlay framework includes templates that you can use to build your audio app’s user interface. To use these templates, include the `com.apple.developer.carplay-audio` entitlement.\n\nBefore iOS 14, you built CarPlay-enabled audio apps using the Media Player framework, and included the `com.apple.developer.playable-content` entitlement. To support iOS 13 and earlier, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/MediaPlayer] framework and this entitlement. Your app will also work in iOS 14 and later.\n\nAudio apps can use the CarPlay framework, the Media Player framework, or both. Include the applicable entitlements that match the frameworks you’re using. To be compatible with iOS 13 and earlier, as well as iOS 14 and later, specify keys for both entitlements in the entitlements file.\n\n### Add Backward Compatibility to Communication Apps\n\nIn iOS 14 and later, the CarPlay framework includes templates that you can use to build your communication app’s user interface. To use these templates, include the `com.apple.developer.carplay-communication` entitlement.\n\nYour communication app can use the CarPlay, [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SiriKit], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CallKit] framework, or a combination of the three. Include the entitlements that match the frameworks you’re using. If you use the CarPlay framework, your app can’t present a custom user interface in iOS 13 or earlier. However, users can still interact with your app as they have in previous versions.\n\nThe following example shows what you might add to a messaging app’s entitlements file, providing compatibility with iOS 13 and earlier, as well as iOS 14 and later:\n\nIf your CarPlay-enabled communication app includes VoIP features, provide support for doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/sirikit\/instartcallintent. If the VoIP app targets iOS 14 or earlier, provide support for doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/sirikit\/instartaudiocallintent and doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/sirikit\/insearchcallhistoryintent in addition to doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/sirikit\/instartcallintent.",
