  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA scene manages your CarPlay-enabled app’s user interface, including the window that CarPlay displays on the vehicle’s screen. Navigation apps are the only app category that have access to this window, and use it to draw their map content. All other categories of apps use only the scene’s interface controller to manage their user interface.\n\nAs CarPlay manages your app’s scene, you provide a scene delegate — an object that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.carplay\/documentation\/CarPlay\/CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate] protocol — that the system notifies about scene life cycle events. CarPlay creates your app’s scene and scene delegate when the user launches your app.\n\n### Add a CarPlay Scene\n\nTo add a CarPlay scene, provide its configuration in the scene manifest of your Xcode project’s `Info.plist` file. Specify your scene delegate’s class name as the value of the `UISceneDelegateClassName` key.\n\nIn your scene delegate, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.carplay\/documentation\/CarPlay\/CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate\/templateApplicationScene(_:didConnect:)] method and use the interface controller that it provides to set your root template.\n\nIf your app specifies the navigation entitlement, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.carplay\/documentation\/CarPlay\/CPTemplateApplicationSceneDelegate\/templateApplicationScene(_:didConnect:to:)] method instead because it provides a reference to your app’s window that CarPlay manages. Create an instance of your map-drawing view controller and set it as the window’s root view controller. Make sure that you set your interface controller’s root template.\n\n### Add a CarPlay Dashboard Scene\n\nNavigation apps can add an additional scene entry to their scene manifest to enable their maps, upcoming maneuvers, and shortcut buttons to appear in the CarPlay Dashboard.\n\nAdd the following key to the `UIApplicationSceneManifest` dictionary in your Xcode project’s `Info.plist` file to specify that your app supports the CarPlay Dashboard:\n\nIn the same file, add the CarPlay Dashboard scene configuration to the `UISceneConfigurations` dictionary. Provide your dashboard scene delegate’s class name as the value of the `UISceneDelegateClassName` key.\n\nIn your dashboard scene delegate, implement [doc:\/\/com.apple.carplay\/documentation\/CarPlay\/CPTemplateApplicationDashboardSceneDelegate\/templateApplicationDashboardScene(_:didConnect:to:)]. Use the window that the method provides to render your map content. Set the dashboard controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.carplay\/documentation\/CarPlay\/CPDashboardController\/shortcutButtons] property to an array of buttons — up to a maximum of two — that the CarPlay Dashboard displays when your app isn’t actively navigating.",
