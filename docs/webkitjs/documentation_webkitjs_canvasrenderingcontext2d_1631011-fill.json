  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe `fill()` method makes a solid shape from the current path, even if the path is not closed. For complex paths, it is possible to create a filled shape with a unfilled areas. For example, to create a doughnut, rather than a circle, create a circular subpath, going clockwise or or counterclockwise, then create another circular subpath, completely inside the first circle or completely surrounding it, with the second circle going in the opposite direction clockwise from the first circle. The area between the two circles is filled, but the interior of the smaller circle is not. The `fill()` method uses the **non-zero number winding rule** to determine whether a point within a path should be filled or not. ",
