If `true`, the event can bubble; otherwise, it cannot.\n- **cancelable**: Indicates whether an event can have its default action prevented. If `true`, the default action can be prevented; otherwise, it cannot.\n- **view**: The view (DOM window) where the event occurred.\n- **detail**: Specifies some detail information about the event depending on the type of event.\n- **screenX**: The x-coordinate of the event’s location in screen coordinates.\n- **screenY**: The y-coordinate of the event’s location in screen coordinates.\n- **clientX**: The x-coordinate of the event’s location relative to the window's viewport.\n- **clientY**: The y-coordinate of the event’s location relative to the window's viewport.\n- **ctrlKey**: If `true`, the control key is pressed; otherwise, it is not.\n- **altKey**: If `true`, the alt key is pressed; otherwise, it is not.\n- **shiftKey**: If `true`, the Shift key is pressed; otherwise, it is not.\n- **metaKey**: If `true`, the meta key is pressed; otherwise, it is not.\n- **target**: The target of this gesture.\n- **scale**: The distance between two fingers since the start of an event as a multiplier of the initial distance. The initial value is `1.0`. If less than `1.0`, the gesture is pinch close (to zoom out). If greater than `1.0`, the gesture is pinch open (to zoom in).\n- **rotation**: The delta rotation since the start of an event, in degrees, where clockwise is positive and counter-clockwise is negative. The initial value is `0.0`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to programmatically create a `GestureEvent` object.\n\n",
