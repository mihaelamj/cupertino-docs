Alternatively, draws a specified region of the image, mapped to a specified region of the canvas.\n\n## Declaration\n\n```swift\nvoid drawImage(\n    CanvasImageSource image, \n    unrestricted float x, \n    unrestricted float y\n);\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- **image**: An image object (an `img`, `canvas`, or `video` element).\n- **x**: The x-coordinate of the left edge of the destination for the drawing, in pixels from the left edge of the canvas coordinate system.\n- **y**: The y-coordinate of the top of the destination for the drawing, in pixels from the top of the canvas coordinate system.\n- **ow**: The width of the drawn image. This parameter is optional; if omitted, the native width of the image is used. If present, the image is scaled to this width.\n- **oh**: The height of the drawn image. This parameter is dependent on the `ow` parameter—if `ow` is supplied, `oh` must also be supplied; if `ow` is omitted, `oh` must be omitted. If omitted, the native height of the image is used. If present, the image is scaled to this height.\n- **sx**: The x-coordinate of the left edge of the region of the image to draw, in pixels from the left edge of the image.\n- **sy**: The y-coordinate of the top of the region of the image to draw, in pixels from the top of the image.\n- **sw**: The width of the region of the image to draw.\n- **sh**: The height of the region of the image to draw.\n- **dx**: The x-coordinate of the left edge of the region of the canvas where the image is to be drawn, in pixels from the left edge of the canvas coordinate system.\n- **dy**: The y-coordinate of the top of the region of the canvas where the image is to be drawn, in pixels from the top of the canvas coordinate system.\n- **dw**: The width of the drawn image. The specified region of the image is scaled to this width.\n- **dh**: The height of the drawn image. The specified region of the image is scaled to this height.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe image object can be an `img` element, a `canvas` element, or a `video` element.
