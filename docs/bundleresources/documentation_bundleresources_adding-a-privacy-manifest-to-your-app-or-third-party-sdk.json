  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA privacy manifest is a property list file (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) that you add to your target’s resources. The privacy manifest describes the privacy practices of an app or third-party SDK. To add a privacy manifest to your app or third-party SDK using Xcode, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/privacy-manifest-files]. All privacy manifest files in your app must be valid, containing only the expected keys and values. For more information, see “Describe the data your app or third-party SDK collects,” in [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/describing-data-use-in-privacy-manifests].\n\nWhen you add a privacy manifest to the target that builds your app or third-party SDK in Xcode, Xcode automatically places this file in the correct location based on the type of product and its target platform. If you don’t use Xcode to build your product, use the information below to place the privacy manifest in the correct location. Even if you use Xcode, you might find this information useful to verify the privacy manifest location in your product.\n\n### Add a privacy manifest to your app\n\nIf you build an iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS app, place the privacy manifest at the root of your app’s bundle. The example below shows the bundle structure of an iOS app called `Sample`, which lists `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` at `Sample.app\/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`:\n\nFor macOS and Mac Catalyst apps, place the privacy manifest file in `Contents\/Resources\/` in your app’s bundle. The following example shows the bundle structure of a macOS app called `MacSample`, which lists `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` at `MacSample.app\/Contents\/Resources\/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`:\n\n### Add a privacy manifest to your framework\n\nThe location where you place the privacy manifest in your framework depends on the platform. For iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS frameworks, place the privacy manifest at the root of your framework’s bundle. The example below shows the layout of an iOS framework called `SampleFramework`, which lists `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` at `SampleFramework.framework\/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`:\n\nFor macOS and Mac Catalyst frameworks, place the privacy manifest file in `Versions\/A\/Resources\/` in your framework’s bundle. The following example shows the layout of a macOS framework named `MacSampleFramework` that supports a single version (`A)`and includes a privacy manifest file. Its bundle structure lists `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` at `MacSampleFramework.framework\/Versions\/A\/Resources\/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`:\n\n### Add a privacy manifest to your Swift package\n\nA Swift package’s resources can include its privacy manifest file. For more information about adding resource files to Swift packages, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package]. Source files reside in a subfolder of a package’s `Sources` directory that has the same name as the target they belong to. This is the default location for resources. If your resource files reside in the default location, add the privacy manifest to it. The following example shows a package manifest that declares the `SomeLibrary` target. Place your privacy manifest file in *Sources\/SomeLibrary* if you don’t specify an alternative location, as shown below:\n\nAlternatively, if your resource files reside in a subfolder separate from your source files, add the privacy manifest to this directory. Place your privacy manifest file in `Sources\/SomeLibrary\/Resources` if you put all your resource files into a directory named `Resources`:\n\nXcode doesn’t recognize privacy manifest files as resources by default. After adding the manifest file to your package, explicitly declare the file or the directory that includes it as a package resource. In the following example, the package manifest declares `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` as an explicit resource:\n\nIn this example, the package manifest lists the `Resources` directory as an explicit resource:\n\nIf you distribute your binary framework as a Swift package, check that your XCFramework bundle includes a privacy manifest for each platform that you support. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/distributing-binary-frameworks-as-swift-packages].\n\n### Distribute your static library with a privacy manifest\n\nA static library is an archive of object files with a `.a` file extension. It doesn’t support resources such as the privacy manifest. If you currently distribute your SDK as a static library and want to update it to include a privacy manifest in Xcode, create a new static framework target that includes all your static library’s source files and resources, then add the privacy manifest to the target’s resource. For more information on how to create a static framework, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/creating-a-static-framework].\n\nIf you don’t use Xcode to build your static library, create a static framework bundle for your static library manually, then add the privacy manifest to the bundle as a resource. For more information about framework bundle structure, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/placing-content-in-a-bundle]. To identify the privacy manifest location in the static framework, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/adding-a-privacy-manifest-to-your-app-or-third-party-sdk#Add-a-privacy-manifest-to-your-framework].\n\n### Verify your XCFramework bundle includes the necessary privacy manifests\n\nAn XCFramework bundle is a binary package that can include multiple platform-specific variants of a framework or library. It supports distribution of Swift and C-based code. For more information about creating an XCFramework bundle, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/creating-a-multi-platform-binary-framework-bundle].\n\nAfter adding a privacy manifest to your framework, consider distributing it as a signed XCFramework bundle. When you generate an XCFramework bundle with your framework, the generated bundle contains a privacy manifest file for each platform that your framework supports. The framework platform determines the location of the manifest file. When you sign your XCFramework bundle, developers who incorporate the framework can see whether updates to the framework have compatible code signatures. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/verifying-the-origin-of-your-xcframeworks].\n\nAfter an update, `SampleFramework` supports iOS, iOS Simulator, Mac Catalyst, and macOS. The `MyArchives` directory contains archives of each variant of `SampleFramework`. Running the following command in Terminal creates an XCFramework with variants for iOS, iOS Simulator, Mac Catalyst, and macOS:\n\nEach variant of `SampleFramework` contains a privacy manifest file at the appropriate location, as shown below:\n\nTo identify the privacy manifest location in frameworks, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/adding-a-privacy-manifest-to-your-app-or-third-party-sdk#Add-a-privacy-manifest-to-your-framework]. To ship your static library with a privacy manifest, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/adding-a-privacy-manifest-to-your-app-or-third-party-sdk#Distribute-your-static-library-with-a-privacy-manifest].\n\n### Locate an invalid privacy manifest in your app archive\n\nTo find an invalid privacy manifest in your app archive:\n\n### Managing an invalid privacy manifest\n\nIf you’re unable to obtain a valid privacy manifest from a third-party SDK developer and need to submit your app, locate the invalid privacy manifest in your app archive, delete it, and submit your archive using Xcode. Alternatively, locate the invalid privacy manifest in your app, fix the validation issues in the file, and submit your archive using Xcode. To troubleshoot invalid privacy manifests, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Technotes\/tn3181-debugging-invalid-privacy-manifest].",

Source files reside in a subfolder of a package’s `Sources` directory that has the same name as the target they belong to. This is the default location for resources. If your resource files reside in the default location, add the privacy manifest to it. The following example shows a package manifest that declares the `SomeLibrary` target. Place your privacy manifest file in *Sources\/SomeLibrary* if you don’t specify an alternative location, as shown below:\n\n```swift\nSamplePackage\/\n    README.md\n    Package.swift\n    Sources\/\n        SomeLibrary\/\n            SomeLibrary.swift\n            Product.swift\n            PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy\n            ...\n    Tests\/\n        ...\n```\n\nAlternatively, if your resource files reside in a subfolder separate from your source files, add the privacy manifest to this directory. Place your privacy manifest file in `Sources\/SomeLibrary\/Resources` if you put all your resource files into a directory named `Resources`:\n\n```swift\nSamplePackage\/\n    README.md\n    Package.swift\n    Sources\/\n        SomeLibrary\/\n            SomeLibrary.swift\n            Product.swift\n            ...\n            Resources\/\n                PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy\n                ...\n    Tests\/\n        ...\n```\n\nXcode doesn’t recognize privacy manifest files as resources by default. After adding the manifest file to your package, explicitly declare the file or the directory that includes it as a package resource. In the following example, the package manifest declares `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` as an explicit resource:\n\n```swift\ntargets: [\n    .target(\n        name: \"SomeLibrary\",\n        resources: [\n            .process(\"PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy\")]\n    ),\n]\n```\n\nIn this example, the package manifest lists the `Resources` directory as an explicit resource:\n\n```swift\ntargets: [\n    .target(\n        name: \"SomeLibrary\",\n        resources: [\n            .process(\"Resources\")]\n    ),\n]\n```\n\nIf you distribute your binary framework as a Swift package, check that your XCFramework bundle includes a privacy manifest for each platform that you support.
