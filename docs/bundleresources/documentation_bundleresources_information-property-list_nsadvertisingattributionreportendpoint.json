Provide a string in the format `“https:\/\/example.com”`, where you replace `example` with your domain name. Include this key in your app for the following two uses:\n\n- To specify where the system sends event attribution data it receives from launched websites that support Private Click Measurement (PCM). PCM won’t work if your app doesn’t include this key.\n- To specify where the system sends a copy of the winning install-validation postback to the advertised app’s developer, for apps that are advertised using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/StoreKit\/SKAdNetwork] API. Including this key is optional.\n\nThe system sends postbacks to a well-known URL it generates using the domain name you provide in the key. To receive the postbacks, configure your server to receive HTTPS POST messages at the following endpoints:\n\n- To receive PCM event attribution data: `https:\/\/example.com\/.well-known\/private-click-measurement\/report-attribution\/`\n- To receive SKAdNetwork install-validation postbacks: `https:\/\/example.com\/.well-known\/skadnetwork\/report-attribution\/`\n\nReplace `example.com` with your domain name.
