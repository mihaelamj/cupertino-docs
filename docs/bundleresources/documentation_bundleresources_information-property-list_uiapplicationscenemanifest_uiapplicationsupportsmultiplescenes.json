If you set the value to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], UIKit never creates more than one scene for your app.\n\nSetting this key to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] has implications for your code. An app that supports multiple scenes must coordinate operations to prevent scenes from interfering with each other. For example, if two scenes access the same shared resource, you must synchronize access to that resource using a serial dispatch queue or some other mechanism. Failure to do so may lead to corrupted data or  unexpected behavior from your app.",
