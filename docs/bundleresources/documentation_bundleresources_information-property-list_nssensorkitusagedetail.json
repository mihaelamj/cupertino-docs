You specify which information by defining an `Info.plist` key in this dictionary for each sensor your app uses, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/NSSensorKitUsageDetail\/SRSensorUsageAmbientLightSensor]. Users approve or deny your app’s ability to read private sensor information based on the description you provide for these properties.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SensorKit\/configuring-your-project-for-sensor-reading].",
