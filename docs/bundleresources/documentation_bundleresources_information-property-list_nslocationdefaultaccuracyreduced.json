Set the key value to `true` to prompt the user for reduced accuracy by default; set it to `false` to prompt for full location accuracy. If you don’t include that key in your `Info.plist`, that’s equivalent to setting it to `false`.\n\nInclude the key pair in your `Info.plist` file as shown:\n\nWhen this key is set to `true`, all Core Location services (location updates, visit monitoring, significant location change, fence monitoring) receive service at the reduced-accuracy service level.  Users will see that your app is asking for reduced accuracy because the location authorization prompt will show a map with an approximate location, and your app will have the Precise Location toggled off in Settings > Privacy > Location Services . These indicators of an app’s improved privacy are ones that users may value.\n\nIf you want to leverage the reduced-accuracy feature to improve privacy in a particular operation without setting this key, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/CLLocationManager\/desiredAccuracy] constant [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CoreLocation\/kCLLocationAccuracyReduced].
