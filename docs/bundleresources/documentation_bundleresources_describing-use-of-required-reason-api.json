Regardless of whether a user gives your app permission to track, fingerprinting is not allowed. Describe the reasons your app or third-party SDK on iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, or watchOS uses these APIs, and check that your app or third-party SDK only uses the APIs for the expected reasons.\n\nFor each category of required reason API that your app or third-party SDK uses, add a dictionary to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/App-Privacy-Configuration\/NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes] array in your app or third-party SDK’s privacy manifest file that reports the reasons your app uses the API category. If you use the API in your app’s code, then you need to report the API in your app’s privacy manifest file. If you use the API in your third-party SDK’s code, then you need to report the API in your third-party SDK’s privacy manifest file. Your third-party SDK can’t rely on the privacy manifest files for apps that link the third-party SDK, or those of other third-party SDKs the app links, to report your third-party SDK’s use of required reasons API.\n\nFor each executable or dynamic library in an app that uses a required reason API, the bundle that includes the executable or dynamic library needs to include a privacy manifest file that reports the API.
