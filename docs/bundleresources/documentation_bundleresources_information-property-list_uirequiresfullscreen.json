In this compatibility mode, the following occurs:\n\n- In iPadOS 26 and later on an iPad that supports the Windowed Apps multitasking mode, or in iPadOS 16 or later on an iPad that supports Stage Manager, the system:\n\n- Maintains a consistent scene size for your app, but doesn’t present your app’s scene full screen\n- Allows your app’s scene to be on screen with other apps’ scenes\n- Scales your app’s presentation when the user resizes it, rather than changing the size of your app’s scene\n- Consults the supported interface orientations of your app and adjusts the interface orientation of your scene accordingly, but doesn’t visually rotate your scene\n- In iPadOS 18 and earlier on an iPad with Split View & Slide Over multitasking enabled, the system:\n\n- Presents your app’s scene full screen\n- Prevents your app’s scene from sharing the screen with other app’s scenes in Split View\n- Prevents your app’s scene from being resized by the user\n- Consults the supported interface orientations of your app, adjusts the interface orientation of your scene accordingly, and visually rotates your scene\n\nIn iPadOS 26 and later, support multitasking and dynamic resizing to make your iPad app flexible.
