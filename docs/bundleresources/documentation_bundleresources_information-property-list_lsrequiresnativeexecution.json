For example, this key prevents the system from using the Rosetta translation process to execute the Intel portion of a universal app on Apple silicon.\n\nIf your app’s binary supports only the Intel architecture and you link the app against the macOS 11 SDK or later, the inclusion of this key prevents your app from running on Apple silicon. If you link the app against an earlier macOS SDK, the app runs under Rosetta translation.",
