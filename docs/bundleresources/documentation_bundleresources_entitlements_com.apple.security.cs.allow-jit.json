The Hardened Runtime disallows this by default, because it creates a security risk. However, some apps and system frameworks rely on this functionality, typically for performance reasons. Examples include:\n\nWithout the `Allow execution of JIT-compiled code entitlement`, frameworks that rely on just-in-time (JIT) compilation may fall back to an interpreter. Other code using JIT compilation may crash or behave in unexpected ways.\n\nDigital rights management (DRM) solutions that currently use unsigned executable memory should instead change to using the `MAP_JIT` flag and the entitlement.\n\nTo add the entitlement to your app, first enable the Hardened Runtime capability in Xcode, and then under Runtime Exceptions, select Allow Execution of JIT-compiled Code.",
