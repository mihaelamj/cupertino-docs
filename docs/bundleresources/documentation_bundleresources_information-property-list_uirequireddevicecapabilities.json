The presence in that array of any of the above possible values indicates that the app requires the corresponding feature. Omit a value to indicate that the app doesn’t require the feature, but it can be present.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a dictionary as the associated value for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.bundleresources\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities] key. In that case, use the values above as the dictionary’s keys, each with an associated Boolean value. Set the value to `true` to require the corresponding feature. Set the value to `false` to indicate that the feature must not be present on the device.
