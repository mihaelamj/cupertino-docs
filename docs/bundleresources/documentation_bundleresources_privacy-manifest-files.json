The privacy manifest is a property list that records the following information:\n\n- The types of data collected by your app or third-party SDK. You need to provide this information for your app or third-party SDK on all platforms.\n- The required reasons APIs your app or third-party SDK uses. You need to provide this information for your app or third-party SDK on iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.\n\nFor each type of data your app or third-party SDK collects and category of required reasons API it uses, the app or third-party SDK needs to record the reasons in its bundled privacy manifest file.\n\n\n\nFor information on editing the privacy manifest file, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Xcode\/editing-property-list-files].\n\n### Create a privacy manifest\n\nTo add the privacy manifest to your app or third-party SDK in Xcode, follow these steps:\n\n- Choose File > New File.\n- Scroll down to the Resource section, and select App Privacy File type.\n- Click Next.\n- Check your app or third-party SDK’s target in the Targets list.\n- Click Create.\n\nBy default, the file is named `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`; this is the required file name for bundled privacy manifests.\n\n\n\nAt the top level of this property list file, add the following keys to the dictionary:\n\n\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Adding a privacy manifest to your app or third-party SDK**: Report the data you collect and the required reasons API you use in your app or third-party SDK.\n- **Describing data use in privacy manifests**: Declare the data collected by your app or by third-party SDKs.\n- **Describing use of required reason API**: Ensure your use of covered API is consistent with policy.\n- **Editing property list files**: Add, remove, and change keys and values in a structured file.\n- **App Privacy Configuration**: A data structure that represents the root object in a privacy manifest file.\n\n## Property Lists\n\n- **Entitlements**: Key-value pairs that grant an executable permission to use a service or technology.\n- **Information Property List**: A resource containing key-value pairs that identify and configure a bundle.\n\n",
