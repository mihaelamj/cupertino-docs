To attain it, submit your research study to Apple as described in [https:\/\/www.researchandcare.org\/resources\/accessing-sensorkit-data\/]. If Apple approves your study, you can create a provisioning profile that signs code with this entitlement. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SensorKit\/configuring-your-project-for-sensor-reading].",
