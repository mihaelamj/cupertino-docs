However, even with the debugging tool entitlement, a debugger can’t get the task ports of processes that don’t have the `Get task allow` entitlement, and that are therefore protected by System Integrity Protection. See the man page for `taskgated(8)` for more information about getting task ports.\n\nXcode automatically adds the `Get task allow` entitlement to apps that you build for debugging, while removing the entitlement before App Store submission. This enables Xcode itself to attach to and debug your app during development.\n\nWhen a non-root user runs an app with the debugging tool entitlement, the system presents an authorization dialog asking for a system administrator’s credentials. If authorization succeeds, the debugger receives a 10-hour session before authorization expires.\n\nTo add this entitlement to your app, first enable the Hardened Runtime capability in Xcode, and then under Runtime Exceptions, select Debugging Tool.",
