Enabling this entitlement tells the system to maintain a consistent performance state over your app’s lifecycle on applicable devices. This allows your app to assess the performance of its workload at any time, including immediately after launch. When your app includes the entitlement:\n\n- The system avoids letting your app run higher performance levels for a period of time, which avoids transitions to other levels later on.\n- You don’t need to implement code to reassess the device’s ability to process your app’s workload after performance level transitions.\n\n\n\n",
