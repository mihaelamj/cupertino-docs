The first time the app runs, the framework presents a prompt that displays the value of this key contained in your project’s `Info.plist`. The system persists the user’s choice in Settings. After your app runs for the first time, it consults the user preference in Settings before it begins a new interaction session.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/NearbyInteraction\/initiating-and-maintaining-a-session].",
