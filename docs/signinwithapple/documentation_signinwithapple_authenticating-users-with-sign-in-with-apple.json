After the user chooses to use Sign in with Apple to log in, your app receives tokens and user information that you can verify from a server.\n\nWhen the user attempts to sign in using Sign in with Apple, the sequence in the following diagram begins:\n\n\n\nYou may group apps in your developer account for Sign in with Apple so an app only requests information the first time the user logs in. A simple confirmation to continue appears even if the app bundle IDs are different across systems, such as iOS, macOS, and the web.\n\n### Authenticate the user and request information\n\nInitialize an authentication session with your app server and associate a client session with an ID token using the `nonce` value. You can request to receive the user’s information, such as name and email address. If the user approves accessing this information, your authorization request includes the requested information.\n\nSign in with Apple protects user accounts by using two-factor authentication. Users that log in to an Apple device can quickly sign in to your app in the following ways:\n\nNative apps only allow the signed-in iCloud user to use Sign in with Apple. Web-based interactions allow logins using any Apple Account.\n\nApple determines whether a user is a real person by combining on-device machine learning, account history, and hardware attestation using privacy-preserving mechanisms. There are three possible values when determining whether a user is a real person:\n\nThis system for detecting whether the user is real is tuned for high-precision and moderate recall time. You may also use it as a feature in your own machine-learning models for detecting account fraud.\n\nWhen someone uses your app and Sign in with Apple for the first time, the identification servers return the user status. Subsequent attempts don’t return the user status.\n\nAfter the user logs in to your app using Sign in with Apple on one of their devices, they can sign in on all of their devices. Deleting your app from a device doesn’t affect this capability. If the user reinstalls your app, they can continue to use Sign in with Apple on any of their devices to sign in with their existing account.\n\n### Retrieve the user’s information from Apple Account servers\n\nThe information you retrieve must include the credentials required to verify the user’s identity. The server returns the credentials and user information based on the initial request. The information that returns can include user identity, full name, verified email address, and real user status.\n\nAfter successfully authenticating the user, the server returns an identity JSON Web Token (JWT), single-use authorization grant code, the state contained in the authorization request, and user identifier to your app. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.signinwithapple\/documentation\/SigninwithAppleRESTAPI\/Request-an-authorization-to-the-Sign-in-with-Apple-server.] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.signinwithapple\/documentation\/SigninwithAppleJS\/AuthorizationI\/id_token].\n\nUse the authorization grant code to verify the token claims with Apple servers, and exchange them for refresh tokens. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.signinwithapple\/documentation\/SigninwithAppleRESTAPI\/Generate-and-validate-tokens].\n\nUse the user identifier instead of an email address to identify the user. If you request the user’s full name, Sign in with Apple collects the information to pass along to your app. The name defaults to the user’s name from their Apple Account, but the user can change their name.\n\nIf you request the user’s verified email address, Sign in with Apple prompts the user to share it with your app. The user may choose to share their real email address or an anonymous one that uses the private email relay service. In both cases, Apple verifies that the email address works and is ready for use.\n\nFor more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.signinwithapple\/documentation\/signinwithapple\/communicating-using-the-private-email-relay-service].\n\n### Send information to app servers and verify tokens\n\nEnsure that your app relays the credentials and user information to your app servers. The API collects this information and shares it with your app the first time the user logs in using Sign in with Apple. If the user then uses Sign in with Apple on another device, the API doesn’t ask for the user’s name or email again. It collects the information again only if the user stops using Sign in with Apple and later reconnects to your app.\n\nAlthough Apple provides the user’s email address in the identity token on all subsequent API responses, it doesn’t include other information about the user, such as their name. When you receive user information from the API response, immediately store it locally so your app can access it again in the event of a process or network failure.\n\nYour app servers verify the validity of the token credentials with Apple Account servers. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.signinwithapple\/documentation\/signinwithapple\/verifying-a-user].\n\n### Prevent duplicate accounts\n\nA user may already have an account in your system, but may attempt to use Sign in with Apple to log in to that account. Sharing the real email address that’s associated with the user’s Apple Account may not help because it may not be the same email the user uses to create the account with your system. There are a couple of ways you can mitigate this issue:",

This works seamlessly to detect and use existing accounts, and prevents creating new accounts using Sign in with Apple.\n- For new accounts that use Sign in with Apple, let the user know that they’re creating a new account, and ask if they have any existing accounts to link to.\n\n## Authentication and verification of users\n\n- **Verifying a user**: Check the validity and integrity of a user’s identity token.\n- **Processing changes for Sign in with Apple accounts**: Manage user-initiated modifications to maintain privacy with server-to-server notifications.\n- **Request an authorization to the Sign in with Apple server**: Add a Sign in with Apple authorization flow to apps and web services that can’t directly access Sign in with Apple JS.\n\n",
