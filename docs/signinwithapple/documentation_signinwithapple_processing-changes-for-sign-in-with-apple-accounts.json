  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nSign in with Apple users can modify their accounts, including deleting or disabling their Apple Accounts. If your app or website hosts such an account, Apple can alert you when these changes occur by delivering developer notifications to your server. To learn how your users manage their account preferences for your app, see [https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT210426].\n\n### Set up your server\n\nTo receive server notifications for Sign in with Apple, your server must support the Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 protocol or later. When determining the endpoint URL on your server to receive notifications, you may use the same URL for multiple developer teams and apps. To configure your Sign in with Apple service to receive notifications, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/help\/account\/configure-app-capabilities\/enabling-server-to-server-notifications].\n\n### Decode and validate the notifications\n\nThese notifications contain a cryptographically signed payload, in JSON Web Signature (JWS) format, signed by Apple’s private key. After your server receives a notification, examine the JWS payload and use the algorithm specified in the header’s `alg` parameter to validate the signature. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.signinwithapple\/documentation\/SigninwithAppleRESTAPI\/Fetch-Apple's-public-key-for-verifying-token-signature].\n\nAfter validating the token signature, your server performs work according to the `type` value in the `events` claim of the token. The notification payload object contains information about user-initiated account modification events. The event types include the following:\n\nExpect an HTTP POST response similar to the following example:\n\n### Process a user’s email forwarding change\n\nUsers can enable or disable email forwarding to your app or website. When a user enables email forwarding, Apple sends a JWT to your registered endpoint URL with the `type` value of `email-enabled` in the `events` claim. A decoded payload for an email-enabled notification has the following format:\n\nWhen a user disables email forwarding, Apple sends a JWT to your registered endpoint URL with the `type` value of `email-disabled` in the `events` claim. A decoded payload for an email-disabled notification has the following format:\n\nTo allow or prevent sending emails to the email address, be sure to update your server’s records according to your process. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.signinwithapple\/documentation\/signinwithapple\/communicating-using-the-private-email-relay-service].\n\n### Process disabling and deleting a user’s Apple Account\n\nUsers can disable their Apple Account for a specific primary app ID, or delete their Apple Account account entirely. When a user disables their Apple Account for an app or app group, Apple sends a JWT to your registered endpoint URL with the `type` value of `consent-revoked` in the `events` claim. A decoded payload for a consent-revoked notification has the following format:\n\nWhen a user requests for Apple to permanently delete their Apple Account, Apple sends a JWT to your registered endpoint URL with the `type` value of `account-delete` in the `events` claim. A decoded payload for an account-delete notification has the following format:\n\nTo indicate when the user disables or permanently deletes their Apple Account, be sure to update your server’s records according to your process.",
