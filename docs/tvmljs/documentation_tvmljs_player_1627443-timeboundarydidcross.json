This can happen multiple times if the user is moving the timing bar back and forth across the boundary. The listener is passed an event object with the following attributes:\n\n- `boundary`—The boundary value that triggered the event when it was crossed.\n- `target`—The event object, which is the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/tvmljs\/player] object.\n- `timeStamp`—The time that the event occurred.\n- `type`—The name of the event.\n\nYou must provide an array of numbers, in seconds, as a third parameter to the listener. Each value in the array represents a time boundary as an offset from the beginning of the asset.\n\n## Responding to Events\n\n- **mediaItemDidChange**: An event notifying the listener that the player changed a media item.\n- **mediaItemWillChange**: An event notifying the listener that the player is about to changed a media item.\n- **playbackDidStall**: An event that indicates that playback has stalled.\n- **playbackError**: An event that indicates an error has occurred during playback.\n- **requestSeekToTime**: An event that indicates whether a seek-to-time request was accomplished.\n- **shouldChangeToMediaAtIndex**: An event that indicates a request to play a media item in a different index is received.\n- **shouldHandleStateChange**: An event that indicates a state change request has occurred.\n- **stateDidChange**: An event that indicates the state of the player has changed.\n- **stateWillChange**: An event that indicates the state of the player is about to change.\n- **timeDidChange**: An event that happens at a specified interval.\n- **timedMetadata**: An event that is triggered whenever a specified piece of metadata is encountered.\n- **transportBarVisibilityDidChange**: An event that indicates the state of the transport bar has changed.\n\n",
