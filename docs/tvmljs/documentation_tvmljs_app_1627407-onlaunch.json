The options argument can contain the following keys:\n\n- `launchContext`—Determines how the app is launched. Set to `background` to launch the app in the background.\n- `location`—Contains the boot TVMLKit JS URL location.\n- `reloadData`—The object passed in to `App.reload()` when the app is relaunched.\n- User defined keys—Any custom keys that were passed to [doc:\/\/com.apple.tvmlkit\/documentation\/TVMLKit\/TVApplicationControllerContext\/launchOptions].\n\n## Responding to App Life Cycle Events\n\n- **onError**: A callback function that is automatically called when an error is sent from the Apple TV.\n- **onExit**: A callback function that is automatically called when the app has been exited.\n- **onResume**: A callback function that is automatically called when the app moves to the foreground.\n- **onSuspend**: A callback function that is automatically called when the app is sent to the background.\n\n",
