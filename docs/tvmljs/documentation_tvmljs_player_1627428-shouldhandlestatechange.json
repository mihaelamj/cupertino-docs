Only a single `shouldHandleStateChange` listener can be active at a time. If multiple listeners are set to listen for `shouldHandleStateChange`, only the last one will be updated. The listener is passed an event object with the following attributes:\n\n- `duration`—The duration, in seconds, of the asset being played.\n- `elapsedTime`—The elapsed time, in seconds, of the asset being played.\n- `oldState`—The previous state of the player. Valid values are `playing`, `paused`, and `scanning`.\n- `state`—The state that the player is about to switch to. Valid values are `playing`, `paused`, and `scanning`.\n- `target`—The event object, which is the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/tvmljs\/player] object.\n- `timeStamp`—The time that the event occurred.\n- `type`—The name of the event.\n\nThe listener must return one of the following values:\n\n- `true`. The state is allowed.\n- `false`. The state change is not allowed.\n\n\n\n## Responding to Events\n\n- **mediaItemDidChange**: An event notifying the listener that the player changed a media item.\n- **mediaItemWillChange**: An event notifying the listener that the player is about to changed a media item.\n- **playbackDidStall**: An event that indicates that playback has stalled.\n- **playbackError**: An event that indicates an error has occurred during playback.\n- **requestSeekToTime**: An event that indicates whether a seek-to-time request was accomplished.\n- **shouldChangeToMediaAtIndex**: An event that indicates a request to play a media item in a different index is received.\n- **stateDidChange**: An event that indicates the state of the player has changed.\n- **stateWillChange**: An event that indicates the state of the player is about to change.\n- **timeBoundaryDidCross**: An event that indicates a specific playback time in the media item has been crossed.\n- **timeDidChange**: An event that happens at a specified interval.\n- **timedMetadata**: An event that is triggered whenever a specified piece of metadata is encountered.\n- **transportBarVisibilityDidChange**: An event that indicates the state of the transport bar has changed.\n\n",
