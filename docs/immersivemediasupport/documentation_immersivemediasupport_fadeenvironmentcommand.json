If fade commands are absolute time based, then property time dictates the time it needs to start executing and keep fading until the duration property value. On the other hand if they are offset based, then offset property dictates the fade percentage from the start time of the fade command till the duration of the fade. If the fade has to start at time 0.0 second of the playback for duration of 1.0 seconds and if the media FPS is 90, then first frame should be accompanied with presentation metadata with fade command which has 0.011 as offset. Second frame should have fade command with offset 0.022 and so on. For the 90th frame, we should receive offset 1.0.",

Fade environment commands can be absolute time based or offset based. If fade commands are absolute time based, then property time dictates the time it needs to start executing and keep fading until the duration property value. On the other hand if they are offset based, then offset property dictates the fade percentage from the start time of the fade command till the duration of the fade.

This value represents the target opacity of the environment backdrops during playback after fading completes.\n- **time**: The time this command starts during playback.\n\n## Instance Methods\n\n- **encode(to:)**: Encodes an instance of fade environment command.\n\n## Enumerations\n\n- **FadeEnvironmentCommand.FadeDirection**: A value that represents the direction of the fade environment command.\n\n## Presentation commands\n\n- **PresentationCommand**: A set of properties that define the interface for a presentation command.\n- **FadeCommand**: A command type for color fading during immersive media playback.\n- **SetCameraCommand**: A command type for immersive camera switching during playback.\n- **ShotFlopCommand**: A command type to flip the video frames horizontally (mirrored horizontally) during playback for the duration of the command.\n- **PresentationDescriptor**: A structure that represents dynamic metadata used during playback or when outputting the metadata track for an immersive video file.\n- **PresentationDescriptorReader**: An object that provides the functionality required to understand and process immersive presentation commands.\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- Sendable\n- SendableMetatype\n\n",
