If no mask is provided, the one inside LensParameters will be used.\n- **positionable**: A flag that indicates whether to anchor this calibration in mixed reality 3D space rather than centering it on the person’s eye position.\n- **origin**: The position information that represents the origin from which to render the calibration in 3D space relative to the person’s eye.\n- **textureMapping**: The texture mapping that describes how each section of the video frame maps into the calibration.\n- **environmentFilename**: The USDZ filename for calibrations with a backdrop.\n\n",
