Use it to read and write AIV-specific metadata and enable previewing content in editorial workflows.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Authoring Apple Immersive Video**: Prepare and package immersive video content for delivery.\n\n## Camera metadata\n\n- **VenueDescriptor**: The Apple Immersive Media Venue Descriptor is a collection of static metadata necessary for every Apple Immersive Video.\n- **ImmersiveCamera**: A structure that holds the required information for an immersive media camera to process and render video frames.\n- **ImmersiveCameraCalibration**: A structure that represents immersive media camera calibration data.\n- **ImmersiveCameraMask**: A structure that holds the camera mask type information and its relevant mask name.\n- **ImmersiveDynamicMask**: A type that holds the information required to dynamically generate an immersive media mask at load time.\n\n## Presentation commands\n\n- **PresentationCommand**: A set of properties that define the interface for a presentation command.\n- **FadeCommand**: A command type for color fading during immersive media playback.\n- **FadeEnvironmentCommand**: A command type for opacity fading environment backdrops during immersive media playback.\n- **SetCameraCommand**: A command type for immersive camera switching during playback.\n- **ShotFlopCommand**: A command type to flip the video frames horizontally (mirrored horizontally) during playback for the duration of the command.\n- **PresentationDescriptor**: A structure that represents dynamic metadata used during playback or when outputting the metadata track for an immersive video file.\n- **PresentationDescriptorReader**: An object that provides the functionality required to understand and process immersive presentation commands.\n\n## Parametric immersive support\n\n- **ParametricImmersiveAssetInfo**: An object that helps convert the original wide field of view video asset to parametric immersive asset.\n\n## Immersive video rendering support\n\n- **ImmersiveCameraViewModel**: A view model that holds all the resources needed to render an immersive camera view.\n- **ImmersiveVideoMask**: A video mask to use during video rendering to smooth the edges of the mesh.\n\n## Preview\n\n- **ImmersiveMediaPreviewMessagingProtocol**: An object that represents the messaging protocol a remote preview sender and receiver use to communicate.\n\n## Validation\n\n- **AIVUValidator**: A type to validate existing AIVU files to ensure that they meet the minimum requirements for AIV.\n\n## Classes\n\n- **ImmersiveCameraMeshCalibration**: Calibration mesh geometry based on USDZ data.\n- **ImmersiveImageMask**: An object that holds all the information needed to load immersive media masks from image data or from a file.\n- **ImmersiveMediaRemotePreviewReceiver**: An observable object that helps apps handle receiving commands and data sent from an immersive media remote preview sender object.\n- **ImmersiveMediaRemotePreviewSender**: An observable object that helps an app send the required data to all connected receiver apps to help facilitate the complete preview of the immersive media playback.\n\n## Structures\n\n- **ImmersiveCameraLensDefinition**: This type holds the ILPD lens configuration parameters to generate camera calibration type instance.\n- **ImmersiveVideoFrame**: A type that represents an immersive video frame. An immersive video frame contains: - layout (SideBySide, OverUnder, Separate, Mono) - presentationTime: frame presentation time - pixelBuffers: an array with one or more images representing the frame.\n\n",
