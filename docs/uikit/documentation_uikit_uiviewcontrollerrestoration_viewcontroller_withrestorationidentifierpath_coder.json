If your restoration class determines that it doesn’t make sense to display this view controller now, it may return `nil` from this method to prevent that view controller (and its children) from being added to your interface during the restoration process.\n\nYou use the strings in the `identifierComponents` parameter to identify the view controller being requested. The view controllers in your app form a hierarchy. At the root of this hierarchy is the window’s root view controller, which itself may present or embed other view controllers. Those presented or embedded view controllers may themselves present and embed other view controllers. The result is a hierarchy of view controller relationships, with each presented or embedded view controller becoming a child of the view controller that presented or embedded it. The strings in the `identifierComponents` array identify the path through this hierarchy from the root view controller to the desired view controller.\n\nIt isn’t always necessary to create a new view controller object in your implementation of this method. You can also return an existing view controller object that was created by another means. For example, if the view controller had already been loaded from a storyboard file, you’d return that object rather than create a new one.\n\nYour implementation of this method may use any data in the provided `coder` to assist in the restoration process. However, you don’t need to restore the entire state of the view controller at this point.
