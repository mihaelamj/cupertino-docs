Events occurring within the bounds of a control are handled by the control first, giving the control a chance to call its action method. Specifically, UIKit controls call their action method in the following situations:\n\n- A single finger single tap occurs on a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIButton], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UISwitch], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIStepper], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UISegmentedControl], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPageControl] object.\n- A single finger swipe occurs on the knob of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UISlider] object, in a direction parallel to the slider.\n- A single finger pan occurs on the knob of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UISwitch] object, in a direction parallel to the switch.\n\nTo handle any of the preceding gestures before the control calls its action method, install your gesture recognizer on the control itself. Gesture recognizers handle touch events before the views to which they’re attached. As a result, installing a gesture recognizer directly on a control prevents that control from calling its action method.\n\n\n\n## Simultaneous gestures\n\n- **Preferring one gesture over another**: Use a gesture recognizer delegate object to determine the order in which gestures are recognized in your views.\n- **Allowing the simultaneous recognition of multiple gestures**: Learn how to use a delegate object to allow detection of more than one gesture at a time.\n\n",
