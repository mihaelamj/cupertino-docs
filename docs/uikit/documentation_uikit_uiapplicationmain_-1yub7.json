If you specify `nil`, `UIApplication` is assumed.\n- **delegateClassName**: The name of the class from which the application delegate is instantiated. If `principalClassName` designates a subclass of [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication], you may designate the subclass as the delegate; the subclass instance receives the application-delegate messages. Specify `nil` if you load the delegate object from your application’s main nib file.\n\n## Return Value\n\nEven though an integer return type is specified, this function never returns.
