The menu’s pointer is placed at the center of the top or bottom of the target rectangle as appropriate. Note that if you make the width or height of the target rectangle zero, `UIMenuController` treats the target area as a line or point for positioning (for example, an insertion caret or a single point).\n\nOnce it is set, the target rectangle does not track the view; if the view moves (such as would happen in a scroll view), you must update the target rectangle accordingly.",
