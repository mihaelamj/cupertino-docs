That view controller must be the parent of the view controller whose view is being added. Otherwise, this exception is raised. This consistency check is also performed when a view controller is added as a child by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/addChild(_:)] method.\n\nIt is also allowed for a view controller that has no parent to add its view to the view hierarchy. This is generally not recommended, but is useful in some special cases.",
