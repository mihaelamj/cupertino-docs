In earlier versions of iOS, the notification object is `nil`.\n\nThe `userInfo` dictionary contains information about the keyboard. To get the location and size of the keyboard from the `userInfo` dictionary, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/keyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey].\n\nThe keyboard’s frame uses the screen’s coordinate space, which is different than the coordinate space of your views. Although they might sometimes match, such as when your app is full screen, they might be different when your app isn’t full screen, such as in Split View, Slide Over, and Stage Manager. This means you need to account for this difference by converting the keyboard’s frame from the screen’s coordinate space to that of your views. For an example of how to handle this conversion, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey].\n\nThe system posts this notification on the main actor.
