During the launch sequence, UIKit calls methods in your app delegate and scene delegate so you can prepare your app for user interaction and perform any tasks specific to your app’s requirements. The following illustrates the individual steps of this launch sequence, from when the user or system launches your app to when the sequence completes:\n\n\n\n1. The system executes the `main()` function that Xcode provides in an Objective-C project, or that’s available when you use `@main` in a Swift project.\n2. The `main()` function calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:)-1yub7], which creates an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication] and your app delegate.\n3. UIKit calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] method in your app delegate.\n4. UIKit performs view controller state restoration, which results in the execution of additional methods in your app delegate and app’s view controllers. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/about-the-ui-restoration-process].\n5. UIKit calls your app delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] method.\n6. After the app launch completes, UIKit prepares a scene to connect to your app, and then calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UISceneDelegate\/scene(_:willConnectTo:options:)]. UIKit may deliver a user activity to this method for you to handle during scene connection.\n\nAfter the launch sequence completes, the system displays your app’s user interface and informs your app or scene delegates when life-cycle events occur.\n\n### Prepare your app for prewarming\n\nIn iOS 15 and later, the system may, depending on device conditions, *prewarm* your app — launch nonrunning application processes to reduce the amount of time the user waits before the app is usable.
