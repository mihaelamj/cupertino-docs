Don’t use OpenGL ES in the background.\n\nReturn from [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)] as quickly as possible. Your implementation of this method has approximately five seconds to perform any tasks and return. If the method doesn’t return before time runs out, your app is terminated and purged from memory.\n\nIf you need additional time to perform any final tasks, request additional execution time from the system by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:)]. Call [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:)] as early as possible. Because the system needs time to process your request, there’s a chance that the system might suspend your app before that task assertion is granted. For example, don’t call [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:)] at the very end of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)] method and expect your app to continue running.\n\nPerform any tasks related to adjusting your user interface before [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)] exits. Move other tasks (such as saving state) to a concurrent dispatch queue or secondary thread as needed. Because it’s likely any background tasks you start in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)] won’t run until after that method exits, request additional background execution time before starting those tasks. In other words, first call [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/beginBackgroundTask(expirationHandler:)] and *then* run the task on a dispatch queue or secondary thread.\n\nUIKit also posts a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/didEnterBackgroundNotification] around the same time it calls this method to give interested objects a chance to respond to the transition.\n\nFor more information about how to transition gracefully to the background, and for information about how to start background tasks, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/iPhone\/Conceptual\/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide\/Introduction\/Introduction.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007072].",
