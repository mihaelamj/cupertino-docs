The action sheet also calls this method itself in response to the user tapping one of the buttons in the action sheet.\n\nIn iOS 4.0, you may want to call this method whenever your application moves to the background. An action sheet is not dismissed automatically when an application moves to the background. This behavior differs from previous versions of the operating system, where they were canceled automatically when the application was terminated. Dismissing the action sheet gives your application a chance to save changes or abort the operation and perform any necessary cleanup in case your application is terminated later.",
