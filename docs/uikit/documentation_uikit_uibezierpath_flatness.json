Smaller values result in smoother curves but require more computation time. Larger values result in more jagged curves but are rendered much faster. The default flatness value is `0.6`.\n\nIn most cases, you should not change the flatness value. However, you might increase the flatness value temporarily to minimize the amount of time it takes to draw a shape temporarily (such as during scrolling).",
