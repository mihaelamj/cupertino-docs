  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis sample code project uses a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImageView] instance to show how any instance or subclass of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView] class can act as a drag source or a drop destination.\n\nTo enable drag and drop, you add one or more interaction objects to a view. To provide or consume data, you implement the protocol methods in the interaction delegates.\n\n### Get started\n\nDeploy this sample code project on iPad, which supports drag and drop between apps. When you first launch this project’s built app, you see an image view containing an image. Use this app along with a second app that has images, such as Photos. For example, configure the iPad screen to Split View, with this app side by side with Photos. Then drag the image from this app into Photos, or drag an image from Photos into this app.\n\n### Enable drag and drop interactions\n\nTo enable dragging, dropping, or both, attach interactions to views. A convenient place for this code is in an app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidLoad()] method.\n\nAdd the drag interaction:\n\nAdd the drop interaction:\n\nEnabling drag and drop for an image view, which this project uses, requires an additional step. You must explicitly enable user interaction, like this:\n\n### Provide data for a drag session\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDragInteractionDelegate\/dragInteraction(_:itemsForBeginning:)] method is the one essential method for allowing dragging from a view.\n\nThe system calls this delegate method in response to the user gesture that initiates dragging. In your implementation, return an array of one or more drag items, each with one item provider. In each item provider, specify one or more data representations of the model object to be dragged. The model object must conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSItemProviderWriting] protocol.\n\nFor more about providing data for dragging, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/making-a-view-into-a-drag-source].\n\n### Consume data from a drop session\n\nTo enable a view to consume data from a drop session, you implement three delegate methods.\n\nFirst, your app can refuse the drag items based on their uniform type identifiers (UTIs), the state of your app, or other requirements. Here, the implementation allows a user to drop only a single item that conforms to the `kUTTypeImage` UTI:\n\nSecond, you must tell the system how you want to consume the data, which is typically by copying it. You specify this choice by way of a drop proposal:\n\nFinally, after the user lifts their finger from the screen, indicating their intent to drop the drag items, your view has one opportunity to request particular data representations of the drag items:\n\nIn addition to these three methods, drag and drop offers additional API hooks for customizing your adoption of the feature.
