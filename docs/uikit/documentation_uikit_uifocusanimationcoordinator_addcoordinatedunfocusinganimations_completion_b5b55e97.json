The animations you specify are run in the same animation block as the system animations. Use the information in the `context` parameter to determine any custom behaviors for your animations. For example, you might configure your animations to run in half the time as the main animation and start after a short delay.",

This block has no return value and takes the following parameter:\n\n\n- **completion**: The block object to execute after the main animation completes. The specified animations are run in the same animation context as the main animation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhen focus is being removed from an item, use this method to coordinate your custom animations with the system animations.
