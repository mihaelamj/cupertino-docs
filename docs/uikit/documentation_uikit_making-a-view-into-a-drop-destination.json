Your first steps to make this happen are:\n\n1. Create a drop interaction (a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDropInteraction] instance).\n2. Specify the drop interaction’s delegate (an object that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDropInteractionDelegate] protocol).\n3. Add the interaction to the view’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/interactions] property.\n\nHere’s how to do this:\n\n```swift\nfunc customEnableDropping(on view: UIView, dropInteractionDelegate: UIDropInteractionDelegate) {\n    let dropInteraction = UIDropInteraction(delegate: dropInteractionDelegate)\n    view.addInteraction(dropInteraction)\n}\n```\n\n### Consider accepting the drag items\n\nWhen the user moves the touch point of a drag session over a drop destination, you can immediately refuse it, or you can tell the system to continue its conversation with your delegate object.

The user moves their finger onscreen so the touch point of a drag session is within a configured view in your app. The system instantiates a drop session (an object that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDropSession] protocol, not shown in the figure) for managing the drop activity.\n2. The system calls the drop interaction delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDropInteractionDelegate\/dropInteraction(_:canHandle:)] protocol method. Check whether your app can, and opts to, consume the drag items.\n3. The system calls the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDropInteractionDelegate\/dropInteraction(_:sessionDidEnter:)] protocol method. Prepare to consume the drag items.\n4. The system calls the delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDropInteractionDelegate\/dropInteraction(_:sessionDidUpdate:)] protocol method. Your implementation *must* return a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDropProposal] object, or the system ends the session.\n5. If the user confirms their intent to complete the drop, the system calls the delegate’s asynchronous [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDropInteractionDelegate\/dropInteraction(_:performDrop:)] protocol method. This a destination app’s only opportunity to request representations of drag items.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Understanding a drag item as a promise**: Use drag items to convey data representation promises between a source app and a destination app.\n- **Making a view into a drag source**: Adopt drag interaction APIs to provide items for dragging.\n- **Adopting drag and drop in a custom view**: Demonstrates how to enable drag and drop for a `UIImageView` instance.\n- **Adopting drag and drop in a table view**: Demonstrates how to enable and implement drag and drop for a table view.\n\n",
