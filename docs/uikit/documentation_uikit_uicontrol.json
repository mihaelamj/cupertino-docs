  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nControls implement elements such as buttons and sliders, which your app can use to facilitate navigation, gather user input, or manipulate content. Controls use the target-action mechanism to report user interactions to your app.\n\n\n\nYou don’t create instances of this class directly. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl] class is a subclassing point that you extend to implement custom controls. You can also subclass existing control classes to extend or modify their behaviors. For example, you might override the methods of this class to track touch events yourself or to determine when the state of the control changes.\n\nA control’s state determines its appearance and its ability to support user interactions. Controls can be in one of several states, which the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/State-swift.struct] type defines. You can change the state of a control programmatically according to your app’s needs. For example, you might disable a control to prevent the user from interacting with it. User interactions can also change the state of a control.\n\n### Respond to user interaction\n\nThe target-action mechanism simplifies the code that you write to use controls in your app. Instead of writing code to track touch events, you write action methods to respond to control-specific events. For example, you might write an action method that responds to changes in the value of a slider. The control handles all the work of tracking incoming touch events and determining when to call your methods.\n\nWhen adding an action method to a control, you specify both the action method and an object that defines that method to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/addTarget(_:action:for:)] method. (You can also configure the target and action of a control in Interface Builder.) The target object can be any object, but it’s typically the view controller’s root view that contains the control. If you specify `nil` for the target object, the control searches the responder chain for an object that defines the specified action method.\n\nThe signature of an action method takes one of three forms. The `sender` parameter corresponds to the control that calls the action method, and the `event` parameter corresponds to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIEvent] object that triggered the control-related event.\n\nThe system calls action methods when the user interacts with the control in specific ways. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/Event] type defines the types of user interactions that a control can report and those interactions mostly correlate to specific touch events within the control. When configuring a control, you must specify which events trigger the calling of your method. For a button control, you might use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/Event\/touchDown] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/Event\/touchUpInside] event to trigger calls to your action method. For a slider, you might care only about changes to the slider’s value, so you might choose to attach your action method to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/Event\/valueChanged] events.\n\nWhen a control-specific event occurs, the control calls any associated action methods immediately. The current [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication] object dispatches action methods and finds an appropriate object to handle the message, following the responder chain, if necessary. For more information about responders and the responder chain, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/EventHandling\/Conceptual\/EventHandlingiPhoneOS\/index.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40009541].\n\n### Configure control attributes in Interface Builder\n\nThe following table lists the attributes for instances of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl] class.\n\n### Support localization\n\nBecause [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl] is an abstract class, you don’t internationalize it specifically. However, you do internationalize the content of subclasses like [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIButton]. For information about internationalizing a specific control, see the reference for that control.\n\n### Make controls accessible\n\nControls are accessible by default. To be useful, an accessible user interface element must provide accurate and helpful information about its screen position, name, behavior, value, and type. This is the information VoiceOver speaks to users. Users who are blind or have low vision can rely on VoiceOver to help them use their devices.\n\nControls support the following accessibility attributes:\n\nThe `UIControl` class provides default content for the value and frame attributes. Many controls automatically enable additional specific traits as well. You can configure other accessibility attributes programmatically or with the Identity inspector in Interface Builder.\n\nFor more information about accessibility attributes, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/UserExperience\/Conceptual\/iPhoneAccessibility\/Introduction\/Introduction.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008785].\n\n### Subclassing notes\n\nSubclassing [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl] gives you access to the built-in target-action mechanism and simplified event-handling support. You can subclass existing controls and modify their behavior in one of two ways:\n\nIf you subclass [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl] directly, your subclass is responsible for setting up and managing your control’s visual appearance.

To be useful, an accessible user interface element must provide accurate and helpful information about its screen position, name, behavior, value, and type. This is the information VoiceOver speaks to users. Users who are blind or have low vision can rely on VoiceOver to help them use their devices.\n\nControls support the following accessibility attributes:\n\n- **Label.** A short, localized word or phrase that succinctly describes the control or view, but doesn’t identify the element’s type. Examples are *Add* and *Play*.\n- **Traits.** A combination of one or more individual traits, each of which describes a single aspect of an element’s state, behavior, or usage. For example, you might use a combination of the Keyboard Key and the Selected traits to describe an element that behaves like a keyboard key and that’s in a selected state.\n- **Hint.** A brief, localized phrase that describes the results of an action on an element. Examples are *Adds a title* and *Opens the shopping list*.\n- **Frame.** The frame of the element in screen coordinates, which the `CGRect` structure specifies for an element’s screen location and size.\n- **Value.** The current value of an element when the label doesn’t represent the value. For example, the label for a slider might be *Speed*, but its current value might be *50%*.\n\nThe `UIControl` class provides default content for the value and frame attributes. Many controls automatically enable additional specific traits as well. You can configure other accessibility attributes programmatically or with the Identity inspector in Interface Builder.\n\nFor more information about accessibility attributes, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/UserExperience\/Conceptual\/iPhoneAccessibility\/Introduction\/Introduction.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008785].\n\n### Subclassing notes\n\nSubclassing [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl] gives you access to the built-in target-action mechanism and simplified event-handling support. You can subclass existing controls and modify their behavior in one of two ways:\n\n- Override the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/sendAction(_:to:for:)] method of an existing subclass to observe or modify the dispatching of action methods to the control’s associated targets. You might use this method to modify the dispatch behavior for the specified object, selector, or event.\n- Override the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/beginTracking(_:with:)], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/continueTracking(_:with:)], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/endTracking(_:with:)], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/cancelTracking(with:)] methods to track touch events occurring in the control. You can use the tracking information to perform additional actions. Always use these methods to track touch events instead of the methods that the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder] class defines.\n\nIf you subclass [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl] directly, your subclass is responsible for setting up and managing your control’s visual appearance.
