You must explicitly add an observer to these notifications to receive them. The system coalesces multiple related notifications so that the app receives only one notification with the net changes.\n\nWhen a suspended app starts running again, the system delivers any queued notifications on the app’s main thread before it delivers any touch events or user input.
