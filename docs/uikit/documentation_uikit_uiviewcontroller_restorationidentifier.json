In addition, the contents of the string are your way to identify the purpose of the view controller.\n\nDuring subsequent launches, UIKit asks your app for help in recreating the view controllers that were installed the last time your app ran. When it asks for a specific view controller, UIKit provides your app with this restoration identifier and the restoration identifiers of any parent view controllers in the view controller hierarchy. Your app must use this information to create or locate the appropriate view controller object.",
