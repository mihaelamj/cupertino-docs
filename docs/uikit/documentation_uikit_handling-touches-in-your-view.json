  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nIf you don’t plan to use gesture recognizers with a custom view, you can handle touch events directly from the view itself. Because views are responders, they can handle Multi-Touch events and many other types of events. When UIKit determines that a touch event occurred in a view, it calls the view’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesBegan(_:with:)], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesMoved(_:with:)], or [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesEnded(_:with:)] method. You can override these methods in your custom views and use them to provide a response to touch events.\n\nThe methods you override in your views (or in any responder) to handle touches correspond to different phases of the touch event-handling process. For example, the following image illustrates the different phases of a touch event. When a finger (or Apple Pencil) touches the screen, UIKit creates a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch] object, sets the touch location to the appropriate point, and sets its [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch\/phase-swift.property] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch\/Phase-swift.enum\/began]. When the same finger moves around the screen, UIKit updates the touch location and changes the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch\/phase-swift.property] property of the touch object to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch\/Phase-swift.enum\/moved]. When the user lifts the finger from the screen, UIKit changes the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch\/phase-swift.property] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch\/Phase-swift.enum\/ended] and the touch sequence ends.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the system may cancel an ongoing touch sequence at any time; for example, when an incoming phone call interrupts the app. When it does, UIKit notifies your view by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesCancelled(_:with:)] method. You use that method to perform any needed cleanup of your view’s data structures.\n\nUIKit creates a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch] object for each new finger that touches the screen. The touches themselves are delivered with the current [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIEvent] object. UIKit distinguishes between touches originating from a finger and from Apple Pencil, and you can treat each of them differently.",
