However, if you have a view that contains nonview items, such as icons or text images, that need to be accessible to users with disabilities, you create accessibility elements to represent them. In this case, the containing view should implement the UIAccessibilityContainer informal protocol and use this method to create an accessibility element to represent each item that should be exposed to an assistive application.",
