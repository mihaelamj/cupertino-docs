This notification lets your app know that the device is about to be locked and that any protected files it is currently accessing might become unavailable shortly.\n\nIf your app is currently accessing a protected file, you can use this method to release any references to that file. Although it is not an error to access the file while the device is locked, any attempts to do so will fail. Therefore, if your app depends on the file, you might want to take steps to avoid using that file while the device is locked.",
