If the path contains any open subpaths, this method implicitly closes them before painting the fill region.\n\nThe painted region includes the pixels right up to, but not including, the path line itself. For paths with large line widths, this can result in overlap between the fill region and the stroked path (which is itself centered on the path line).\n\nThis method automatically saves the current graphics state prior to drawing and restores that state when it is done, so you do not have to save the graphics state yourself.",

Values can range between `0.0` (transparent) and `1.0` (opaque). Values outside this range are clamped to `0.0` or `1.0`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method fills the path using the current fill color and drawing properties (plus the specified blend mode and transparency value).
