A value of 0.0 renders the image totally transparent while 1.0 renders it fully opaque. Values larger than 1.0 are interpreted as 1.0.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method draws the entire image in the current graphics context, respecting the image’s orientation setting. In the default coordinate system, images are situated down and to the right of the specified point. This method respects any transforms applied to the current graphics context, however.\n\n## Drawing images\n\n- **draw(at:)**: Draws the image at the specified point in the current context.\n- **draw(in:)**: Draws the entire image in the specified rectangle, scaling it as necessary to fit.\n- **draw(in:blendMode:alpha:)**: Draws the entire image in the specified rectangle using the specified compositing options.\n- **drawAsPattern(in:)**: Draws a tiled Quartz pattern using the receiver’s contents as the tile pattern.\n\n",
