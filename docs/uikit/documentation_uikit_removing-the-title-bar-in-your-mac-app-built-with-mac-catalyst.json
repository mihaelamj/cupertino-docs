A horizontal line separates the title bar from the content of the window.\n\nSome Mac apps such as Messages and Contacts have no title bar in their main window. Instead, the top of the window shows only the Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons with no separator between them and the window’s content. In this UI design, the content area fills the entire height of the window.\n\nThe following image illustrates these styles in two windows. The first window displays a title bar, while the second has none.\n\n\n\n### Remove the title bar\n\nIf you choose to design your window without a title bar, you must remove it from the window. To remove the title bar, set the title bar’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITitlebar\/titleVisibility] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITitlebarTitleVisibility\/hidden] and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITitlebar\/toolbar] property to `nil`.
