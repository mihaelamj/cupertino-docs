You can override this method and return a different frame rectangle as needed. For example, you might specify a smaller frame rectangle if you want some of the underlying content to show around the edges of the presented view.\n\nUIKit calls this method multiple times during the course of a presentation, so your implementation should return the same frame rectangle each time. Do not use this method to make changes to your view hierarchy or perform other one-time tasks.",
