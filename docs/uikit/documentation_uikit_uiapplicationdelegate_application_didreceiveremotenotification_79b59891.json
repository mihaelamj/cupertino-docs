The provider originates it as a JSON-defined dictionary that iOS converts to an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDictionary] object; the dictionary might contain only property-list objects plus [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNull].\n\n## Discussion\n\nImplement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:)] method instead of this one whenever possible. If your delegate implements both methods, the app object calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:)] method.\n\nIf the app is running, the app calls this method to process incoming remote notifications. The `userInfo` dictionary contains the `aps` key whose value is another dictionary with the remaining notification data. Although you should not need the information in the `aps` dictionary, you can retrieve its contents using the following keys:\n\n- `alert`—The value is either a string for the alert message or a dictionary with two keys: `body` and `show-view`. The value of the `body` key is a string containing the alert message and the value of the `show-view` key is a Boolean. If the value of the `show-view` key is `false`, the alert’s View button is not shown. The default is to show the View button which, if the user taps it, launches the app.\n- `badge`—A number indicating the quantity of data items to download from the provider. This number is to be displayed on the app icon. The absence of a `badge` property indicates that any number currently badging the icon should be removed.\n- `sound`—The name of a sound file in the app bundle to play as an alert sound. If “default” is specified, the default sound should be played.\n\nThe `userInfo` dictionary may also have custom data defined by the provider according to the JSON schema. The properties for custom data should be specified at the same level as the `aps` dictionary. However, custom-defined properties should not be used for mass data transport because there is a strict size limit per notification (256 bytes) and delivery is not guaranteed.\n\nIf the app is not running when a remote notification arrives, the method launches the app and provides the appropriate information in the launch options dictionary. The app does not call this method to handle that remote notification.
