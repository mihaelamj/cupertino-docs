Any index paths you specify in this block must be relative to the presentation layer of the object (instead of relative to its data source object). This block takes no parameters and has no return value.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to perform actions on the current object, when the index paths for those actions are relative to the object’s presentation layer. For example, you might call this method to modify a table view or collection view that has uncommitted updates.\n\n",
