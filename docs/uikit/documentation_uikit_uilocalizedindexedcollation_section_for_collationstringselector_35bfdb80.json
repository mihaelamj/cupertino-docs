The method represented by the selection must take no arguments and return an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSString] object. For example, you might specify the selector for a `name` property of the object.\n\n## Return Value\n\nAn integer that identifies the section in which the model object belongs. The numbers returned indicate a sequential ordering.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe table-view controller should iterate through all model objects for the table view and call this method for each object.

It uses this localized name when collating titles.
