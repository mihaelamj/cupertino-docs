It also excludes all of the view controller’s children from being preserved.\n\n### Encode any object in your app\n\nState restoration isn’t limited to your app’s views and view controllers. Any object that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIStateRestoring] protocol can also be included in the restoration archive. For example, you might adopt this protocol in an object that stores global configuration data for your app. To add an object like this to the archive:\n\n1. Register the object while your app is running by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/registerObject(forStateRestoration:restorationIdentifier:)] method of [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication]. For example, you might register a configuration object immediately after creating it.\n2. In one of your [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIStateRestoring\/encodeRestorableState(with:)] methods, encode the object into the restoration archive. You can also encode it in your app delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:willEncodeRestorableStateWith:)] method.\n\nYou can encode any data you want for your custom objects, as long as it’s sufficient to return that object to its previous state during the next launch cycle. Encode data that isn’t crucial to your app’s behavior, and never encode data that should be persisted in other ways. For example, don’t encode your app’s settings or user data that must persist between launch cycles.\n\n## Process details\n\n- **About the UI restoration process**: Learn how to customize the UIKit state restoration process.\n\n",
