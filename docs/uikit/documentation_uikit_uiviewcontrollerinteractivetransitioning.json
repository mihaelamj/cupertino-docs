  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nAn *interactive transition delegate* (which is the term for an object that supports this protocol) can respond to touch events, or to time-varying programmatic input, by speeding up, slowing down, or even reversing the progress of a view controller transition. For example, an interactive transition on a navigation controller could respond to a swipe gesture by moving a view controller onto or off of the navigation stack.\n\nTo support an interactive view controller transition, you must also provide a transition animator delegate, which is a custom object that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning] protocol. The transition delegate and the transition animator can, if you wish, be defined within a single custom class, but the class must adopt both protocols.\n\nIf you instead want to provide a fixed-duration animated view controller transition — one that doesn’t support user interaction — use a transition animator delegate on its own. Refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning].\n\nFor the methods you can call to retrieve view transition context information from within your [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning\/startInteractiveTransition(_:)] method, refer to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewControllerContextTransitioning].",
