The system uses its gestures to implement system-level behaviors, such as to display Control Center.\n\nWhenever possible, you should allow the system gestures to take precedence. However, immersive apps can use this property to allow app-defined gestures to take precedence over the system gestures. You do that by overriding this property and returning the screen edges for which your gestures should take precedence.\n\nIf you change the edges preferred by your view controller, update the value of this property and call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/setNeedsUpdateOfScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures()] method to notify the system that the edges have changed.\n\nFor information on showing and hiding the visual indicator for returning to the Home Screen, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/prefersHomeIndicatorAutoHidden].",
