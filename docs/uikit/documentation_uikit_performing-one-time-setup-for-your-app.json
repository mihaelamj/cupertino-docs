For example, you might want to:\n\n- Download required data from your server.\n- Copy document templates or modifiable data files from your app bundle to a writable directory.\n- Configure default preferences for the user.\n- Set up user accounts or gather other required data.\n\nPerform any one-time tasks in your app delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] method.

For tasks that require user input, make all changes to your user interface in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] method.\n\n### Install files in the proper locations\n\nYour app has its own container directory for storing files, and you should always place app-specific files in the `~\/Library` subdirectory. Specifically, store your files in the following `~\/Library` subdirectories:\n\n- `~\/Library\/Application Support\/` — Store app-specific files that you want backed up with the user’s other content. (You can create custom subdirectories here as needed.) Use this directory for data files, configuration files, document templates, and so on.\n- `~\/Library\/Caches\/` — Store temporary data files that can be easily regenerated or downloaded.\n\nTo obtain a URL for one of the directories in your app’s container, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager\/urls(for:in:)] method of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/FileManager].\n\n```swift\nlet appSupportURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: \n      .applicationSupportDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)\n\nlet cachesURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: \n      .cachesDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)\n```\n\nPlace any temporary files in your app’s `tmp\/` directory. Temporary files might include compressed files that you intend to delete once their contents have been extracted and installed elsewhere.
