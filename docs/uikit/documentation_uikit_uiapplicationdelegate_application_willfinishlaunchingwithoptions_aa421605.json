The system ignores the return value if the app launches as a result of a remote notification.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method (and the corresponding [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] method) to initialize your app and prepare it to run. In an app that doesn’t support scenes, the system calls this method after your app launches and loads its main storyboard or nib file, but before restoring your app’s state. When the system calls this method, your app is in the inactive state.\n\nIf the system launched your app for a specific reason, the `launchOptions` dictionary contains data indicating the reason for the launch. For some launch reasons, the system may call additional methods of your app delegate. For example, if your app launched to open a URL, the system calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:open:options:)] method after your app finishes initializing itself. The presence of the launch keys gives you the opportunity to plan for that behavior. In the case of a URL to open, you might want to prevent state restoration if the URL represents a document that the person wanted to open.\n\nWhen the system asks to open a URL, the system combines the return result from this method with the return result from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] method to determine whether to handle a URL. If either method returns [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], the system doesn’t call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:open:options:)] method. If you don’t implement one of the methods, the system only considers the return value of the implemented method.\n\nIn some cases, a person launches your app with a Home Screen quick action. To ensure you handle this launch case correctly, read the discussion in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:performActionFor:completionHandler:)] method.",
