If you specify a negative value or `0`, the changes are made without animating them.\n- **delay**: The amount of time (measured in seconds) to wait before beginning the animations. Specify a value of `0` to begin the animations immediately.\n- **options**: A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list of valid constants, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/AnimationOptions].\n- **animations**: A block object containing the changes to commit to the views. This is where you programmatically change any animatable properties of the views in your view hierarchy. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be `NULL`.\n- **completion**: A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations actually finished before the completion handler was called. If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at the beginning of the next run loop cycle. This parameter may be `NULL`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method initiates a set of animations to perform on the view. The block object in the `animations` parameter contains the code for animating the properties of one or more views.\n\nDuring an animation, user interactions are temporarily disabled for the views being animated. (Prior to iOS 5, user interactions are disabled for the entire application.) If you want users to be able to interact with the views, include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/AnimationOptions\/allowUserInteraction] constant in the `options` parameter.\n\n## Animating views\n\n- **animate(_:changes:completion:)**\n- **animate(springDuration:bounce:initialSpringVelocity:delay:options:animations:completion:)**: Animates changes to one or more views using a spring animation with the specified duration, bounce, initial velocity, delay, options, and completion handler.\n- **animate(withDuration:animations:completion:)**: Animate changes to one or more views using the specified duration and completion handler.\n- **animate(withDuration:animations:)**: Animate changes to one or more views using the specified duration.\n- **transition(with:duration:options:animations:completion:)**: Creates a transition animation for the specified container view.\n- **transition(from:to:duration:options:completion:)**: Creates a transition animation between the specified views using the given parameters.\n- **animateKeyframes(withDuration:delay:options:animations:completion:)**: Creates an animation block object that can be used to set up keyframe-based animations for the current view.\n- **addKeyframe(withRelativeStartTime:relativeDuration:animations:)**: Specifies the timing and animation values for a single frame of a keyframe animation.\n- **perform(_:on:options:animations:completion:)**: Performs a specified system-provided animation on one or more views, along with optional parallel animations that you define.\n- **animate(withDuration:delay:usingSpringWithDamping:initialSpringVelocity:options:animations:completion:)**: Performs a view animation using a timing curve corresponding to the motion of a physical spring.\n- **performWithoutAnimation(_:)**: Disables a view transition animation.\n- **modifyAnimations(withRepeatCount:autoreverses:animations:)**: Repeats the specified animations a specific number of times, optionally running the animation forward and backward.\n\n",
