Never call this method directly; use `setNeedsUpdateProperties` to schedule an update.\n- **setNeedsUpdateProperties()**: Call to manually request a properties update for the view controller. Multiple requests may be coalesced into a single update alongside the next layout pass.\n- **updatePropertiesIfNeeded()**: Forces an immediate properties update for this view controller and its view, including any view controllers and views in this subtree.\n- **viewWillLayoutSubviews()**: Notifies the view controller that its view is about to lay out its subviews.\n- **viewDidLayoutSubviews()**: Notifies the view controller when its view finishes laying out its subviews.\n- **updateContentUnavailableConfiguration(using:)**: Updates the content-unavailable configuration for the provided state.\n\n",
