It also calls the method before transitioning your app to the background state.\n\nUse this method to quiet your interface and prepare it to stop interacting with the user. Specifically, pause ongoing tasks, disable timers, and decrease frame rates or stop updating your interface altogether. Games should use this method to pause the game. By the time this method returns, your app should be doing minimal work while it waits to transition to the background or to the foreground again.\n\nIf your scene has unsaved user data, save that data in this method to ensure that it isn’t lost. However, never save data solely from this method. Instead, save it at appropriate points from your view controllers, usually in response to user actions. For example, save data when the user dismisses a data-entry screen. Don’t rely on specific app transitions to save all of your app’s critical data.\n\nIn addition to calling this method, UIKit posts a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIScene\/willDeactivateNotification] and a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/willResignActiveNotification].\n\nFor more information about what to do when your app resigns the active state, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/preparing-your-ui-to-run-in-the-background].",
