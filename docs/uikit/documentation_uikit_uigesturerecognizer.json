  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nA *gesture recognizer* decouples the logic for recognizing a sequence of touches (or other input) and acting on that recognition. When one of these objects recognizes a common gesture or, in some cases, a change in the gesture, it sends an action message to each designated target object.\n\nThe concrete subclasses of [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer] are the following:\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer] class defines a set of common behaviors that can be configured for all concrete gesture recognizers. It can also communicate with its delegate (an object that adopts the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizerDelegate] protocol), thereby enabling finer-grained customization of some behaviors.\n\nA gesture recognizer operates on touches hit-tested to a specific view and all of that view’s subviews. It thus must be associated with that view. To make that association you must call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView] method [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/addGestureRecognizer(_:)]. A gesture recognizer doesn’t participate in the view’s responder chain.\n\nA gesture recognizer has one or more target-action pairs associated with it. If there are multiple target-action pairs, they’re discrete, and not cumulative. Recognition of a gesture results in the dispatch of an action message to a target for each of the associated pairs. The action methods invoked must conform to one of the following signatures:\n\nMethods conforming to the latter signature permit the target in some cases to query the gesture recognizer sending the message for additional information. For example, the target could ask a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIRotationGestureRecognizer] object for the angle of rotation (in radians) since the last invocation of the action method for this gesture. Clients of gesture recognizers can also ask for the location of a gesture by calling [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/location(in:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/location(ofTouch:in:)].\n\nThe gesture interpreted by a gesture recognizer can be either discrete or continuous. A discrete gesture, such as a double tap, occurs but once in a multi-touch sequence and results in a single action sent. However, when a gesture recognizer interprets a continuous gesture such as a rotation gesture, it sends an action message for each incremental change until the multi-touch sequence concludes.\n\nA window delivers touch events to a gesture recognizer before it delivers them to the hit-tested view attached to the gesture recognizer. Generally, if a gesture recognizer analyzes the stream of touches in a multi-touch sequence and doesn’t recognize its gesture, the view receives the full complement of touches. If a gesture recognizer recognizes its gesture, the remaining touches for the view are canceled. The usual sequence of actions in gesture recognition follows a path determined by default values of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/cancelsTouchesInView], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/delaysTouchesBegan], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/delaysTouchesEnded] properties:\n\nNote that “recognize” in the above descriptions doesn’t necessarily equate to a transition to the Recognized state.\n\n### Subclassing notes\n\nYou may create a subclass of [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer] that recognizes a distinctive gesture — for example, a “check mark” gesture. If you’re going to create such a concrete gesture recognizer, be sure to import the `UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h` header file (for Objective-C) or the `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass` module (for Swift). This file declares all the methods and properties a subclass must either override, call, or reset.\n\nGesture recognizers operate within a predefined state machine, transitioning to subsequent states as they handle multi-touch events. The states and their possible transitions differ for continuous and discrete gestures. All gesture recognizers begin a multi-touch sequence in the Possible state ([doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/possible]). Discrete gestures transition from Possible to either Recognized ([doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/recognized]) or Failed ([doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/failed]), depending on whether they successfully interpret the gesture or not. If the gesture recognizer transitions to Recognized, it sends its action message to its target.\n\nFor continuous gestures, the state transitions a gesture recognizer might make are more numerous, as indicated in the following sequence:\n\nThe Changed state is optional and may occur multiple times before the Cancelled or Ended state is reached. The gesture recognizer sends action messages at each state transition. Thus for a continuous gesture such as a pinch, action messages are sent as the two fingers move toward or away from each other. The `enum` constants representing these states are of type [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum]. (Note that the constants for Recognized and Ended states are synonymous.)\n\nSubclasses must set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/state-swift.property] property to the appropriate value when they transition between states.\n\n#### Methods to override\n\nThe methods that subclasses must override are described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer#Implementing-subclasses]. Subclasses must also periodically reset the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/state-swift.property] property (as described above) and may call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/ignore(_:for:)-5f685] method.\n\n#### Special considerations\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/state-swift.property] property is declared in `UIGestureRecognizer.h` as being read-only. This property declaration is intended for clients of gesture recognizers. Subclasses of `UIGestureRecognizer` must import the `UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h` header file (for Objective-C) or the `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass` module (for Swift).
