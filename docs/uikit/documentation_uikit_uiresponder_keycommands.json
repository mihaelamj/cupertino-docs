Each key command object represents the keyboard sequence to recognize and the action method of the responder to call in response.\n\nThe key commands you return from this method are applied to the entire responder chain. When a key combination is pressed that matches a key command object, UIKit walks the responder chain looking for an object that implements the corresponding action method. It calls that method on the first object it finds and then stops processing the event.",
