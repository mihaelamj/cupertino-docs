  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nCloudKit Sharing provides real-time collaboration between one or more people using your app. A user takes certain steps to make collaboration possible, from inviting people to participate in the collaboration to setting restrictions on what participants can do. To provide these steps to a user, you must make changes to your app. With [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController], the changes require minimum effort.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController] view controller class provides screens, presented within your app, for managing the people, permissions, and access rights associated with a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKShare] record. The controller, along with a few lines of your own code, facilitates the setup and management of online sharing between users, making it possible for a user to:\n\nThe controller provides these different actions to the user based on the user’s role. If the user is the individual sharing the record (where the record is an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecord] representing the data to share), then the user is called the *owner*. A user who has access to the shared record and isn’t the owner is known as a *participant*. There’s no need for you to specify the user’s role. The controller determines the role automatically.\n\n### Inviting participants to a new share\n\nThe user who owns the data, represented as a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecord], can invite others to view or collaborate on changes to the data. To invite participants, the owner sends the share link to the other people. To provide this capability in your app, create an instance of [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController] using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController\/init(preparationHandler:)] initializer method. You use this initializer method only when the owner isn’t already sharing the record.\n\nAfter creating the controller, you present it. The controller displays the Invitation screen. Using this screen, the owner can add participants and set restrictions on the shared record. Once done, the owner sends the share link to the participants.\n\nHowever, before the owner can send the share link, CloudKit must generate the link. This link generation happens when saving a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKShare] record, but when do you save it? You save the share record in the `preparationHandler:`.\n\nAfter the owner’s selections are complete, the controller invokes the preparation handler provided in the initializer call. In the handler, you create a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKShare] instance, initializing it with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKRecord] instance that represents the data to share. (This record is called the “root record.”) Next, you save the share and root records using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/CloudKit\/CKModifyRecordsOperation]. Finally, you return the shared record to the controller or return an error if the save failed. See the following code for an example of this in action.\n\n### Adding and removing participants from an existing share\n\nTo allow the owner of an existing share to manage the participants, create the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController] instance using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController\/init(share:container:)] initializer method.\n\nAfter you create the controller, present it to show the People screen. From this screen, the owner can:\n\n### Viewing participants and leaving a share\n\nTo allow a participant to view the list of participants and remove themselves from a share, create the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController] instance using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController\/init(share:container:)] initializer method.\n\nAfter you create the controller, present it to show the People screen. From this screen, the participant can:\n\n### Presenting the controller\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController] is designed for use in a popover. Therefore, you should always set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/popoverPresentationController] source information before presenting the Cloud sharing controller. Doing this ensures that the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController] instance is displayed properly across all device types.\n\nThe following code shows an example of setting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/popoverPresentationController] before presenting a Cloud sharing controller.\n\n### Configuring the controller\n\nBy default, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController] user interface displays a generic thumbnail image and title to the user. You can, however, change these to app-specific representations of the shared record. You accomplish this by setting the controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController\/delegate] property to an object that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingControllerDelegate] protocol, making sure to implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingControllerDelegate\/itemThumbnailData(for:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingControllerDelegate\/itemTitle(for:)] delegate methods.\n\nYou can also show or hide the permission and access options presented to the user by setting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController\/availablePermissions] property on the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICloudSharingController] instance.",
