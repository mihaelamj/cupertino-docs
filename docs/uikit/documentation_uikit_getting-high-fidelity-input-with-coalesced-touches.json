On such devices, UIKit doesn’t deliver the extra touch information automatically, in case the app doesn’t need the extra data. Instead, it coalesces any extra touches into a single [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch] object, whose location reflects only the last recorded touch. However, apps that want the extra precision can retrieve and use the additional touch information.\n\nThe following image illustrates what happens when the user drags Apple Pencil across the device. At the point where UIKit reports a touch event to the app, Apple Pencil has reported four touch positions, but UIKit reports only the last touch to the app by default. The remaining three touches are delivered as coalesced touches, and the app must retrieve them explicitly to use them.\n\n\n\nTo retrieve coalesced touches, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIEvent\/coalescedTouches(for:)] method of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIEvent] object containing the original [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch] object. That method returns the array of all touches since the last event, including the last [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch] object actually delivered to the app. You must retrieve coalesced touches immediately when handling an event. After handling the event, there’s no guarantee that any coalesced touches will remain available.",
