The fingers involved in these gestures must not move significantly from the initial touch points, and you can configure the number of times the fingers must touch the screen. For example, you might configure tap gesture recognizers to detect single taps, double taps, or triple taps.\n\nYou can attach a gesture recognizer in one of these ways:\n\n- Programmatically. Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/addGestureRecognizer(_:)] method of your view.\n- In Interface Builder. Drag the appropriate object from the library and drop it onto your view.\n\n\n\nA [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITapGestureRecognizer] object provides event handling capabilities similar to those of a button — it detects a tap in its view and reports that tap to your action method.
