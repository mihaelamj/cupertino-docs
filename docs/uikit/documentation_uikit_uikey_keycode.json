Where the HID usage code list isn’t specific for a key in a particular language, the keyboard firmware uses the closest equivalent key position so manufacturers can produce keyboards for different languages by simply printing different keycaps.\n\nOne example is the Y key on a North American keyboard. In Germany, the Z key typically occupies the Y key position. Rather than changing the keyboard firmware to put the Z usage code into that place in the descriptor list, the vendor uses the Y usage code on both the North American and German keyboards.\n\nBecause the key mapping may not be exact, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIKey\/charactersIgnoringModifiers] instead of [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIKey\/keyCode] to determine the text value of the key.",
