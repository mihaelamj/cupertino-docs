Including [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIColor] with an object in UIKit allows you to create and customize the UI of your app. For example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView] class (and its descendants) includes background and tint colors to affect how they’re drawn onscreen. The following code example sets the background and tint color of a view.\n\n### Create custom colors and drawing styles\n\nWhen customizing drawings in your app, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIColor] object provides methods that set the fill or stroke colors of the current graphics context. These methods can set the color of an object and create various patterns and styles. The following code shows a simple example of a custom drawing inside a view.",
