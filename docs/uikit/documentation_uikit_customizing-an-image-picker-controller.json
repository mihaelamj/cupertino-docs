  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis sample applies an overlay view to display a custom view hierarchy on top of the default image picker interface.\n\nThe sample app uses an overlay view to:\n\n### Configure the sample code project\n\nBecause the camera isn’t available in Simulator, you’ll need to build and run this sample on a device with iOS 10 or later installed.\n\nWhen you first launch the sample app on device, you’ll need to grant the app permission to use the camera.\n\n### Setup the overlay view\n\nThe sample app uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/cameraOverlayView] property to provide an overlay view that contains the custom view hierarchy. The image picker places the custom overlay view on top of the other image picker views.\n\nAn app can access the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/cameraOverlayView] property only when the source type of the image picker is set to `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera`.\n\nWhen the user interacts with interface elements in the custom view, the app calls an image picker method, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/takePicture()] to capture a photo, and implement other features. This sample’s custom image picker controller interface provides the following features:\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/showsCameraControls] property indicates whether the image picker displays the default camera controls. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/showsCameraControls] property is only accessible when the source type of the image picker is `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.camera`. This sample sets [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/showsCameraControls] to `false` to hide the default controls and provide a custom overlay view.\n\n### Take a picture\n\nTake a picture with the Snap button. Its action method calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/takePicture()] method to actually take a picture.\n\n### Take a delayed picture\n\nTake a picture after a short delay with the Delayed button. Its action method calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/takePicture()] method to take a picture when the timer expires.\n\n### Take repeated pictures\n\nTake repeated pictures at a certain interval with the Start button; for example, one photo every five seconds. Its action method creates a timer to take pictures at certain intervals using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/takePicture()] method.\n\nThis sample takes pictures indefinitely, causing it to run out of memory quickly. You must decide upon a proper threshold of the number of captured photos for your own app (for simplicity, this app does not enforce a limit). To avoid memory constraints, save each taken photo to disk rather than keeping all of the pictures in memory. The system may invoke your app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/didReceiveMemoryWarning()]  method in low memory situations so the app can recover some memory and continue taking photos.\n\nThe camera starts taking pictures as soon as the user taps the Start button (which changes to a Stop button). The camera continues to capture photos until the user taps Stop. Captured images appear in the order taken within the app’s image view.\n\n### Browse media in the Photo Library\n\nTo browse images saved in the photo albums on the device, add a button the user can press to go to their Photo Library. The button’s action method configures the picker for browsing saved media by setting its [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/sourceType-swift.property] property to `UIImagePickerController.SourceType.photoLibrary`, before presenting the picker’s media browser user interface.\n\nSelecting a photo invokes the app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerControllerDelegate\/imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:)] delegate method which saves the selected image to an array and displays it in the app’s image view.\n\nTapping the Cancel button invokes the app’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerControllerDelegate\/imagePickerControllerDidCancel(_:)] delegate method which calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/dismiss(animated:completion:)] to dismiss the picker.",
