It must also provide the content for each component’s row, either as a string or a view. Typically the delegate implements other optional methods to respond to new selections or deselections of component rows.\n\nSee [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPickerView] for a discussion of components, rows, row content, and row selection.",
