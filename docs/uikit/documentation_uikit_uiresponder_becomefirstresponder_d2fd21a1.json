UIKit asks the current first responder to resign as first responder, which it might not do.\n\nIf the current first responder resigns as first responder, UIKit checks this object’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/canBecomeFirstResponder] property, which is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] by default. If the object succeeds in becoming the first responder, it receives subsequent events that target the first responder, and UIKit attempts to display the object’s input view.\n\nOnly call this method on views that are part of the active view hierarchy. To determine whether a view is onscreen, check its [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/window] property. If that property contains a valid window, it’s part of an active view hierarchy.\n\nTo update your object’s state or perform some action such as highlighting the selection, override this method in your custom responders. If you override this method, call `super` at some point in your implementation.\n\nIn iOS 13 or later, the root of the responder chain is the window scene’s key window. In iOS 12 or earlier, the root of the responder chain is the application’s key window.\n\nIf your responder is a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITextField], a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITextView], or a text view that implements the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIKeyInput] protocol, expect the software keyboard to appear only if the view’s root window is a key window. Likewise, if a hardware keyboard is attached, only the first responder from the key window receives key events.",
