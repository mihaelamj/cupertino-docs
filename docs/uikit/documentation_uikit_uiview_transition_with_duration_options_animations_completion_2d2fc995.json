The block you specify in the `animations` parameter contains whatever state changes you want to make. You can use this block to add, remove, show, or hide subviews of the specified view. If you want to incorporate other animatable changes, you must include the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/AnimationOptions\/allowAnimatedContent] key in the `options` parameter.\n\nThe following code creates a flip transition for the specified container view. At the appropriate point in the transition, one subview is removed and another is added to the container view. This makes it look as if a new view was flipped into place with the new subview, but really it is just the same view animated back into place with a new configuration.\n\nDuring an animation, user interactions are temporarily disabled for the views being animated. (Prior to iOS 5, user interactions are disabled for the entire application.)

If you specify a negative value or `0`, the transition is made without animations.\n- **options**: A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list of valid constants, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/AnimationOptions].\n- **animations**: A block object that contains the changes you want to make to the specified view. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be `NULL`.\n- **completion**: A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations actually finished before the completion handler was called. If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at the beginning of the next run loop cycle. This parameter may be `NULL`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method applies a transition to the specified view so that you can make state changes to it. The block you specify in the `animations` parameter contains whatever state changes you want to make. You can use this block to add, remove, show, or hide subviews of the specified view.
