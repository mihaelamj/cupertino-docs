You might use this method to implement workflows that you can’t implement easily in your extension. For example, you might use it to start or manage a user’s workout session. If your app isn’t running, SiriKit launches your app in the background so that the Siri interface remains active.\n\nYour Intents app extension is still responsible for resolving and confirming the intent details. Your extension’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Intents\/INIntentHandlerProviding\/handler(for:)] method must create a response object that resolves and confirms the intent details. In the response object’s `handle(intent:completion:)` implementation, return a response object with a status code of `failureRequiringAppLaunch`. Upon receiving your response, SiriKit launches the app and calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:handle:completionHandler:)]. In your implementation of this app delegate method, handle the intent by performing the user’s intended action if possible. Then call the provided completion handler with a response object that indicates if your app performed the intent or provides a reason it could not.
