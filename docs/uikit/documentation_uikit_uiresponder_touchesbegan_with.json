For touches in a view, this set contains only one touch by default. To receive multiple touches, you must set the view’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/isMultipleTouchEnabled] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true].\n- **event**: The event to which the touches belong.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUIKit calls this method when a new touch is detected in a view or window.
