(For example, instances of [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITextField] have their own undo manager that’s cleared when the text field resigns first-responder status.) When you request an undo manager, the request goes up the responder chain and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWindow] object returns a usable instance.\n\nYou may add undo managers to your view controllers to perform undo and redo operations local to the managed view.",
