The amount of force applied by the field is modeled after the second part of the Lorentz equation (`F = qvB`). When the velocity of a charged item is perpendicular to the uniform magnetic field, the item feels a force normal to both the velocity and the field, resulting in a counter-clockwise rotation. Specifying a negative value for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFieldBehavior\/strength] of the field results in a clockwise rotation.\n\nYou can use magnetic fields as a way to apply forces to an object that are based on charge instead of mass.",
