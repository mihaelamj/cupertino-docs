You can also summarize that policy or statement in your app description.\n\n### Give the User Control Over Data and Protect Data You Collect\n\nRespect the user’s preferences, and take reasonable steps to protect the data that you collect in your apps:\n\n- Provide settings that allow the user to disable access to sensitive information. The operating system does this automatically for protected system resources—like location, contacts, and health data—through the Privacy menu of the Settings app. Extend this behavior to any data you cache from these sources or collect directly. For example, if your users build a social media profile containing personal information, offer them a way to delete the data (including any server copies you have).\n- When storing files in iOS, use the strongest data protection level that works for your app, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/encrypting-your-app-s-files]. Use App Transport Security when sending user or device data over the network, as described in [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/General\/Reference\/InfoPlistKeyReference\/Articles\/CocoaKeys.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/plist\/info\/NSAppTransportSecurity].\n- If your app uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AdSupport\/ASIdentifierManager] class, respect the value of its [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AdSupport\/ASIdentifierManager\/isAdvertisingTrackingEnabled] property. If the user sets that property to false, then use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AdSupport\/ASIdentifierManager] class only for limited advertising purposes, like frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging. See the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AdSupport] framework for additional information.\n- If you must identify users persistently, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDevice\/identifierForVendor] property of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDevice] class or the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AdSupport\/ASIdentifierManager\/advertisingIdentifier] property of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AdSupport\/ASIdentifierManager] class.\n\n### Use the Minimum Amount of Data Required\n\nRequest and use the minimum amount of user or device data needed to accomplish a given task. Don’t seek access to or collect data for unnecessary or non-obvious reasons, or because you think it might be useful later.\n\nIf your app supports audio input, configure your audio session for recording only at the point where you actually plan to begin recording. Don’t configure your audio session for recording at launch time if you don’t plan to record right away. The system alerts users when apps configure their audio session for recording and gives the user the option to disable recording for your app.\n\n## Supporting Privacy\n\n- **Requesting access to protected resources**: Provide a purpose string that explains to a person why you need access to protected resources on their device.\n- **Encrypting Your App’s Files**: Protect the user’s data in iOS by encrypting it on disk.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Adopting Liquid Glass**: Find out how to bring the new material to your app.\n- **UIKit updates**: Learn about important changes to UIKit.\n- **About App Development with UIKit**: Learn about the basic support that UIKit and Xcode provide for your iOS and tvOS apps.\n\n",
