Dynamic items with mass are attracted to the specified point with a force that is proportional to their distance from the point.\n\nWhen setting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFieldBehavior\/strength] of the field, positive values attract items to the field’s position and negative values repel items. The force on the object can be determined by the equation `F = ma`.
