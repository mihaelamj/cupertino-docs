Like cells, supplementary views present data that is managed by the collection view’s data source. But unlike cells, supplementary views are typically designed for a special purpose. For example, header and footer views are laid out differently than cells and can be provided for individual sections or for the collection view as a whole.\n\nIt is up to you to decide how to use the `indexPath` parameter to identify a given supplementary view. Typically, you use the `elementKind` parameter to identify the type of the supplementary view and the `indexPath` information to distinguish between different instances of that view.",
