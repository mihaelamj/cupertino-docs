A view controller manages a single root view, which may itself contain any number of subviews. User interactions with that view hierarchy are handled by your view controller, which coordinates with other objects of your app as needed. Every app has at least one view controller whose content fills the main window. If your app has more content than can fit onscreen at once, use multiple view controllers to manage different parts of that content.\n\nA *container view controller* embeds the content of other view controllers into its own root view. A container view controller may mix custom views with the contents of its contained view controllers to facilitate navigation or to create unique interfaces. For example, a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UINavigationController] object manages a navigation bar and a stack of view controllers (only one of which is visible at a time), and provides an API to add and remove view controllers from the stack.\n\nUIKit provides several standard view controllers for navigation and managing specific types of content. You define the view controllers containing your app’s custom content. You may also define custom container view controllers to implement new navigation schemes.\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Managing content in your app’s windows**: Build your app’s user interface from view controllers, and change the currently visible view controller when you want to display new content.\n- **UIKit Catalog: Creating and customizing views and controls**: Customize your app’s user

user enters into the search bar.\n- **Displaying searchable content by using a search controller**: Create a user interface with searchable content in a table view.\n- **Using suggested searches with a search controller**: Create a search interface with a table view of suggested searches.\n\n## Images and video\n\n- **UIImagePickerController**: A view controller that manages the system interfaces for taking pictures, recording movies, and choosing items from the user’s media library.\n- **UIVideoEditorController**: A view controller that manages the system interface for trimming video frames and encoding a previously recorded movie.\n\n## Documents and directories\n\n- **Customizing a document-based app’s launch experience**: Add unique elements to your app’s document launch scene.\n- **Adding a document browser to your app**: Give users access to their local or remote documents from within your app.\n- **Providing access to directories**: Use a document picker to access the content of a directory outside your app’s container.\n- **Building a document browser-based app**: Use a document browser to provide access to the user’s text files.\n- **Building a document browser app for custom file formats**: Implement a custom document file format to manage user interactions with files on different cloud storage providers.\n- **UIDocumentViewController**: A view controller that manages and presents a document stored locally or in the cloud.\n- **UIDocumentBrowserViewController**: A view controller for browsing and performing actions on documents that you store locally
