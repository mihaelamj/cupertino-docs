Remote notifications that include a `category` key in their payload display buttons for the actions in the corresponding category. If the user taps one of those buttons, the system wakes up the app (launching it if needed) and calls this method in the background. Your implementation of this method should perform the action associated with the specified `identifier` and execute the block in the `completionHandler` parameter as soon as you are done. Failure to execute the completion handler block at the end of your implementation will cause your app to be terminated.\n\nTo configure the actions for a given category, create a UIUserNotificationActionSettings object and register it with the app when you call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/registerUserNotificationSettings(_:)] method.",

This dictionary originates from the provider as a JSON-defined dictionary, which iOS converts to an [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSDictionary] object before calling this method. The contents of the dictionary are the remote notification payload, which consists only of property-list objects plus [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSNull]. For more information about the contents of the remote notification dictionary, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/NetworkingInternet\/Conceptual\/RemoteNotificationsPG\/index.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40008194].\n- **completionHandler**: The block to execute when you are finished performing the specified action.
