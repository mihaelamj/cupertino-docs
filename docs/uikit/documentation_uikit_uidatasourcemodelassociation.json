Those classes use the methods of this protocol to ensure that the same data objects (and not just the same row indexes) are scrolled into view and selected.\n\nBefore you can implement this protocol, your app must be able to identify data objects consistently between app launches. This requires being able to take some identifying marker of the object and convert that marker into a string that can then be saved with the rest of the app state. For example, a Core Data app could convert a managed object’s ID into a URI that it could then convert into a string.\n\nCurrently, only the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITableView] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICollectionView] classes support this protocol. You’d implement this protocol in any objects you use as the data source for those classes.
