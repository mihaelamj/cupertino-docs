Through this method a gesture recognizer receives touch objects (in their [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITouch\/Phase-swift.enum\/began] phase) before the view attached to the gesture recognizer receives them. `UIGestureRecognizer` objects are not in the responder chain, yet observe touches hit-tested to their view and their view’s subviews. After observation, the delivery of touch objects to the attached view, or their disposition otherwise, is affected by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/cancelsTouchesInView], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/delaysTouchesBegan], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/delaysTouchesEnded] properties.\n\nIf the gesture recognizer is interpreting a continuous gesture, it should set its state to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/began] upon receiving this message. If at any point in its handling of the touch objects the gesture recognizer determines that the multi-touch event sequence is not its gesture, it should set it state to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/cancelled].\n\nMultiple touches are disabled by default. In order to receive multiple touch events you must set the a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/isMultipleTouchEnabled] property of the attached view instance to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true].",
