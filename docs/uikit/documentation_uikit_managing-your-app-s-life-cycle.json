  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThe current state of your app determines what it can and can’t do at any time. For example, a foreground app has someone’s attention, so it has priority over system resources, including the CPU. By contrast, a background app must do as little work as possible, and preferably nothing, because it’s offscreen. As your app changes from state to state, you must adjust its behavior accordingly.\n\nWhen your app’s state changes, UIKit notifies you by calling methods of the appropriate delegate object:\n\n### Respond to scene-based life-cycle events\n\nUIKit delivers separate life-cycle events for each scene. A scene represents one instance of your app’s UI running on a device. A person can create multiple scenes for each app, and show and hide them separately. Because each scene has its own life cycle, each can be in a different state of execution. For example, one scene might be in the foreground while others are in the background or are suspended.\n\nThe following figure shows the state transitions for scenes. When a person or the system requests a new scene for your app, UIKit creates it and puts it in the unattached state. Person-requested scenes move quickly to the foreground, where they appear onscreen. A system-requested scene typically moves to the background so that it can process an event. For example, the system might launch the scene in the background to process a location event. When someone dismisses your app’s UI, UIKit moves the associated scene to the background state and eventually to the suspended state. UIKit can disconnect a background or suspended scene at any time to reclaim its resources, returning that scene to the unattached state.\n\n\n\nUse scene transitions to perform the following tasks:\n\n### Respond to app-based life-cycle events\n\nIn iOS 12 and earlier, UIKit delivers all life-cycle events to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate] object. The app delegate manages all of your app’s windows, including those displayed on separate screens. As a result, app state transitions affect your app’s entire UI, including content on external displays.\n\nThe following figure shows the state transitions involving the app delegate object. After launch, the system puts the app in the inactive or background state, depending on whether the UI is about to appear onscreen. When launching to the foreground, the system transitions the app to the active state automatically. After that, the state fluctuates between active and background until the app terminates.\n\n\n\nUse app transitions to perform the following tasks:\n\n### Respond to other significant events\n\nIn addition to handling life-cycle events, apps must also be prepared to handle the events listed in the following table. Use your [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate] object to handle most of these events. In some cases, you may also be able to handle them using notifications, allowing you to respond from other parts of your app.",

UIKit can disconnect a background or suspended scene at any time to reclaim its resources, returning that scene to the unattached state.\n\n\n\nUse scene transitions to perform the following tasks:\n\n- When UIKit connects a scene to your app, configure your scene’s initial UI and load the data your scene needs.\n- When transitioning to the foreground-active state, configure your UI and prepare to interact with a person. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/preparing-your-ui-to-run-in-the-foreground].\n- Upon leaving the foreground-active state, save data and quiet your app’s behavior. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/preparing-your-ui-to-run-in-the-background].\n- Upon entering the background state, finish crucial tasks, free up as much memory as possible, and prepare for your app snapshot. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/preparing-your-ui-to-run-in-the-background].\n- At scene disconnection, clean up any shared resources associated with the scene.\n- In addition to scene-related events, you must also respond to the launch of your app using your [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate] object. For information about what to do at app launch, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/responding-to-the-launch-of-your-app].\n\n### Respond to app-based life-cycle events\n\nIn iOS 12 and earlier, UIKit delivers all life-cycle events to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate] object.

See [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/responding-to-the-launch-of-your-app].\n- At activation, finish configuring your UI and prepare to interact with a person. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/preparing-your-ui-to-run-in-the-foreground].\n- Upon deactivation, save data and quiet your app’s behavior. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/preparing-your-ui-to-run-in-the-background].\n- Upon entering the background state, finish crucial tasks, free up as much memory as possible, and prepare for your app snapshot. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/preparing-your-ui-to-run-in-the-background].\n- At termination, stop all work immediately and release any shared resources. See [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/applicationWillTerminate(_:)].\n\n### Respond to other significant events\n\nIn addition to handling life-cycle events, apps must also be prepared to handle the events listed in the following table.
