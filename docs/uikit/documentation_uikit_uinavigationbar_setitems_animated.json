In addition, this method lets you update the stack without animating the changes, which might be appropriate at launch time when you want to restore the state of the navigation stack to some previous state.\n\nIf animations are enabled, this method decides which type of transition to perform based on whether the last item in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UINavigationBar\/items] array is already on the current navigation stack. If the item is currently on the stack, but is not the topmost item, this method uses a pop transition; if it is the topmost item, no transition is performed. If the item is not on the stack, this method uses a push transition. Only one transition is performed, but when that transition finishes, the entire contents of the stack are replaced with the new items. For example, if items A, B, and C are on the stack and you set items D, A, and B, this method uses a pop transition and the resulting stack contains the items D, A, and B.",

The front-to-back order of the items in this array represents the new bottom-to-top order of the items in the navigation stack.

If [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], replace the stack items without any animations.\n\n## Discussion\n\nYou can use this method to update or replace the navigation items in the stack without pushing or popping each item explicitly.
