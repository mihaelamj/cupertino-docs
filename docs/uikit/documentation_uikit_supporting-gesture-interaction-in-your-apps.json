  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nGesture interaction is one of the most intuitive user experiences on iOS, and gesture recognizers provide an easy way for apps to implement it. iOS defines some [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/ios\/user-interaction\/gestures\/], and apps can use system-provided recognizers to support these standard gestures, or create custom ones for non-standard gestures. This sample demonstrates how to use standard gesture recognizers by adding pan, pinch, and rotation support for three colored views, which this sample calls *pieces*, and how to implement a custom recognizer to reset the pieces to their initial state.\n\n### Set up a gesture recognizer\n\nTo support gesture interaction on a view, create an appropriate gesture recognizer and associate it with the view by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/addGestureRecognizer(_:)] method, as shown below.\n\nXcode includes UIKit’s standard gesture recognizers in its Objects library so developers can use them in storyboards. To associate a recognizer with a view in a storyboard:\n\nWith these steps, Xcode automatically adds the recognizer into the storyboard and associates it with the view. Developers can then add an action for the recognizer the same way they do for other UI elements.\n\n### Handle pan, pinch, and rotation gestures\n\nThis sample uses pan, pinch, and rotation gestures to move, scale, and rotate the views. When users pan a view, UIKit triggers the associated action method, which is `panPiece(_:)` in this sample, passing in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPanGestureRecognizer] instance that carries a translation. The method then calculates and moves the view to the new position, and clears the translation by setting it to `.zero` so next time, its value is still the delta relative to the current position.\n\nSimilarly, when users pinch and rotate a view, this sample uses the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPinchGestureRecognizer\/scale] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIRotationGestureRecognizer\/rotation] properties of `UIPinchGestureRecognizer` and `UIRotationGestureRecognizer` to calculate and apply a new [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/transform], and then clears the properties.\n\nThe `scale` and `rotation` properties are relative to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/CALayer\/anchorPoint] property of the view’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/layer]. To be more intuitive when scaling or rotating a view, this sample moves the anchor point to the location of the gestures, which is usually the centroid of the touches involved in the gestures.\n\n### Allow recognizing multiple gestures simultaneously\n\nUsers sometimes intuitively expect multiple gestures to work simultaneously, like pinching and rotating a view at the same time. This sample allows that by implementing the following [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizerDelegate] method, which returns `true` to allow all gesture recognizers in this sample to work together.\n\nFor the delegate method to take effect, this sample sets the gesture recognizer’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/delegate] property to `self`, which is the view controller that implements the method.\n\nFor gesture recognizers that are in the storyboard, this sample sets up their `delegate` property by Control-dragging the gesture recognizers onto the view controller and selecting `delegate`.\n\n`UIGestureRecognizerDelegate` provides methods for apps to control the order in which gestures are recognized as well. For more information on gesture recognition order, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/preferring-one-gesture-over-another].\n\n### Create a custom gesture recognizer\n\nThis sample creates a custom gesture recognizer, `ResetGestureRecognizer`, which recognizes a gesture that contains at least three horizontal turnings. Users can use the gesture to easily reset the views to their initial state. To do that, move the views away from their initial positions, then put one finger on the area the colored views don’t cover, and move right, left, right, and left (or vice versa), like shaking the finger on the screen.\n\nTo recognize the gesture, this sample picks up a valid touch in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/touchesBegan(_:with:)], and gathers the touched locations in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/touchesMoved(_:with:)]. When a user lifts their finger, which triggers [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/touchesEnded(_:with:)], this sample counts the horizontal turnings in the touched path, and recognizes the gesture by setting the `state` property to `.ended` if the path has more than two turnings.\n\nNote that this sample doesn’t go further to eliminate the location noise or validate the segments by checking their distance. Real-world apps might consider doing that to improve the gesture recognition accuracy and avoid recognizing false positive gestures.\n\nFor more details about custom gesture recognizers, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/implementing-a-custom-gesture-recognizer].",
