A drag-and-drop activity can take place in a single app, or it can start in one app and end in another.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe app from which an item is dragged is the *source app*. The app on which an item is dropped is the *destination app*. For drag and drop in a single app, that app plays both roles simultaneously. The complete user action from start to finish — using system-mediated gestures — is a *drag activity*. A *drag session*, by contrast, is an object that’s managed by the system and that manages the items the user is dragging.\n\nWhen dragging is in progress, the source and destination apps continue to run normally and support user interaction.

You can design your app so that the user can sequentially add drag items to an in-progress drag session, and a destination app can accept multiple, simultaneous drops.\n\nText views and text fields automatically support drag and drop. Collection views and table views offer dedicated, view-specific methods and properties, and text views offer APIs for customizing the views’ drag-and-drop behavior. You can configure any custom view to support drag and drop, as well.\n\n\n\n## Essentials\n\n- **Understanding a drag item as a promise**: Use drag items to convey data representation promises between a source app and a destination app.\n- **Making a view into a drag source**: Adopt drag interaction APIs to provide items for dragging.\n- **Making a view into a drop destination**: Adopt drop interaction APIs to selectively consume dragged content.\n- **Adopting drag and drop in a custom view**: Demonstrates how to enable drag and drop for a `UIImageView` instance.\n- **Adopting drag and drop in a table view**: Demonstrates how to enable and implement drag and drop for a table view.\n\n## Drag and drop interactions\n\n- **UIDragInteractionDelegate**: The interface for configuring and controlling a drag interaction.\n- **UIDropInteractionDelegate**: The interface for configuring and controlling a drop interaction.\n- **UIDragInteraction**: An interaction to enable dragging of items from a view, employing a delegate to provide drag items and to respond to calls from the drag session.\n- **UIDropInteraction**: An interaction to enable dropping of items onto a view, employing a delegate to instantiate objects and respond to calls from the drop session.\n\n## Spring-loaded interactions\n\n- **UISpringLoadedInteractionBehavior**: The interface for specifying the behavior of a spring-loaded interaction.\n- **UISpringLoadedInteractionSupporting**: The interface that determines if an object supports a spring-loaded interaction for drag and drop activities.\n- **UISpringLoadedInteraction**: An interaction object for configuring and controlling spring-loaded, user-driven navigation during a drag activity.\n- **UISpringLoadedInteractionContext**: The interface an object implements to provide information about a spring-loaded interaction.\n- **UISpringLoadedInteractionEffect**: The interface for providing visual styling to a spring-loaded interaction based on the interaction state.\n\n## Drag sources\n\n- **UIDragItem**: A representation of an underlying data item as a person drags it from one location to another.\n- **UIDragDropSession**: The common interface for querying the state of both drag sessions and drop sessions.\n- **UIDragSession**: The interface for configuring a drag session.\n- **UIDragAnimating**: The interface for providing custom animation alongside the system’s lift, drop, and cancellation animations.\n\n## Drop destinations\n\n- **UIDropSession**: The interface for querying a drop session about its state and associated drag items.\n- **UIDropProposal**: A configuration for the behavior of a drop interaction, required if a view accepts drop activities.\n- **UIDropOperation**: Operation types that determine how a drag and drop activity resolves when the user drops a drag item.\n- **UIDropSessionProgressIndicatorStyle**: The drop-progress indicator styles for the drop session, used while data is moving from the source to the destination.\n\n## Item providers\n\n- **Data delivery with drag and drop**: Share data between iPad apps during a drag and drop operation using an item provider.\n- **NSItemProvider**: An item provider for conveying data or a file between processes during drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste activities, or from a host app to an app extension.\n- **NSItemProviderReading**: The protocol for implementing a class to allow an item provider to create an instance of the class.\n- **NSItemProviderWriting**: The protocol for implementing a class to allow an item provider to retrieve data from an instance of the class.\n- **UIItemProviderPresentationSizeProviding**\n- **UIItemProviderReadingAugmentationDesignating**\n- **UIItemProviderReadingAugmentationProviding**\n\n## Pasteboard support\n\n- **UIPasteConfiguration**: The interface that an object implements to declare its ability to accept specific data types for pasting and for drag-and-drop activities.\n- **UIPasteConfigurationSupporting**: The interface that determines whether a responder object supports paste configuration.\n\n## Custom drag item previews\n\n- **UIDragPreviewParameters**: A set of parameters for adjusting the appearance of a drag item preview or a targeted drag item preview.\n- **UIDragPreview**: A graphical preview for a single drag item, used by the system after a drag has started and when no related animation is running.\n- **UIDragPreviewTarget**: A geometric specification for the source or destination of a drag item preview, used by the system when a user drops items or cancels a drag activity.\n- **UITargetedDragPreview**: A drag item preview used by the system during lift, drop, or cancellation animation.\n\n## User interactions\n\n- **Touches, presses, and gestures**: Encapsulate your app’s event-handling logic in gesture recognizers so that you can reuse that code throughout your app.\n- **Menus and shortcuts**: Simplify interactions with your app using menu systems, contextual menus, Home Screen quick actions, and keyboard shortcuts.\n- **Pointer interactions**: Support pointer interactions in your custom controls and views.\n- **Apple Pencil interactions**: Handle user interactions like double tap and squeeze on Apple Pencil.\n- **Focus-based navigation**: Navigate the interface of your UIKit app using a remote, game controller, or keyboard.\n- **Accessibility for UIKit**: Make your UIKit apps accessible to everyone who uses iOS and tvOS.\n\n",
