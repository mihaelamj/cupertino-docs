UIKit first asks you to provide the view controller object. If you don’t provide the view controller, UIKit looks for it implicitly. Here’s the sequence of steps that UIKit follows to recreate view controllers:\n\n1. **Asks the view controller’s restoration class.** A restoration class knows how to create a specific view controller. You designate a restoration class by assigning that class to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/restorationClass] property of your view controller. During restoration, UIKit calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewControllerRestoration\/viewController(withRestorationIdentifierPath:coder:)] method of the restoration class to request a new instance of the view controller, which your method then returns. If you return `nil`, UIKit stops trying to create the view controller and leaves it out of the restoration process.\n2. **Asks the app delegate.** If the view controller had no restoration class, UIKit calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:viewControllerWithRestorationIdentifierPath:coder:)] method of the app delegate. If you return `nil` from that method, UIKit continues searching.\n3. **Checks for an existing object.** UIKit looks for an already created view controller with the exact same restoration path.\n4. **Instantiates the view controller from your storyboards.** If it still doesn’t have the view controller, UIKit automatically instantiates it from your app’s storyboards.\n\nBefore state restoration even begins, UIKit loads your app’s default view controllers from your storyboards. Because UIKit loads these view controllers for free, it’s better not to create them using a restoration class or your app delegate. For all other view controllers, assign a restoration class only if the view controller isn’t defined in your storyboards. You might also assign a restoration class to prevent the creation of your view controller in specific circumstances. For example, you might want to avoid displaying the view controller if the associated restoration archive refers to stale or missing data.\n\nWhen recreating view controllers in code, always reassign a value to the view controller’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/restorationIdentifier] property in addition to any other initialization. Also assign a value to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/restorationClass] property as appropriate. Assigning these values at creation time ensures that the view controller will be preserved during the next cycle.\n\n```swift\nfunc viewController(withRestorationIdentifierPath \n                    identifierComponents: [Any], \n                    coder: NSCoder) -> UIViewController? {\n   let vc = MyViewController()\n        \n   vc.restorationIdentifier = identifierComponents.last as?
