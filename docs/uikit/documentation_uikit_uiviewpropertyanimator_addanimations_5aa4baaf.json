  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nUse this method to add new animation blocks to the animator. The animations in the new block run alongside any previously configured animations. Blocks added while the animator’s state is [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimatingState\/inactive] are executed over the time specified by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewPropertyAnimator\/duration] property. Blocks added while the animator’s state is [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimatingState\/active] are executed over the remaining portion of the total run time. For example, if the duration is `2.0` and you add an animation block to a running animator whose [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimating\/fractionComplete] property is `0.5`, the animations run for `1.0` second. Any blocks you add while the animator is running begin executing immediately.\n\nIf the `animation` block modifies a property that’s being modified by a different property animator, then the animators combine their changes in the most appropriate way. For many properties, the changes from each animator are added together to yield a new intermediate value. If a property can’t be modified in this additive manner, the new animations take over as if the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/AnimationOptions\/beginFromCurrentState] option had been specified for a view-based animation.\n\nYou can call this method multiple times to add multiple blocks to the animator. It’s a programmer error to call this method when the animator’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimating\/state] property is set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimatingState\/stopped].",
