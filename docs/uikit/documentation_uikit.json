You can also customize accessibility support, and localize your app’s interface for different languages, countries, or cultural regions.\n\nUIKit works seamlessly with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI] framework, so you can implement parts of your UIKit app in SwiftUI or mix interface elements between the two frameworks. For example, you can place UIKit views and view controllers inside SwiftUI views, and vice versa.\n\nTo build a macOS app, you can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI] to create an app that works across all of Apple’s platforms, or use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/AppKit] to create an app for Mac only.
