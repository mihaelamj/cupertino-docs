This method is called at the end of the animation block, which gives the custom cell a chance to clean up after the state change—for example, removing the edit and reorder controls after transitioning out of editing.  Subclasses must always call `super` when overriding this method.\n\nNote that when the user swipes a cell to delete it, the cell transitions to the state identified by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITableViewCell\/StateMask\/showingDeleteConfirmation] constant but the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITableViewCell\/StateMask\/showingEditControl] is not set.",
