Examples of tasks include performing maintenance on a database, refining a machine learning model, or updating displayed data. You can configure your app to launch and run tasks in the background to take advantage of processing time when the device isn’t used.\n\nTo schedule a task to run in the background, enable the background modes in Xcode, identify the specific tasks that you need, and then register the tasks with the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks\/BGTaskScheduler] object.\n\n### Enable and schedule background tasks\n\nTo configure your app to allow background tasks, enable the background capabilities that you need, and then create a list of unique identifiers for each task.\n\nThere are two types of background tasks: [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks\/BGAppRefreshTask] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks\/BGProcessingTask]. [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks\/BGAppRefreshTask] is for short-duration tasks that expect quick results, such as downloading a stock quote. [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks\/BGProcessingTask] is for tasks that might be time-consuming, such as downloading a large file or synchronizing data. Your app can use one or both of these.\n\nTo add the capabilities:\n\n\n\nYou control which tasks run in the background by registering a list of permitted task identifiers. To create this list, add the identifiers to the `Info.plist` file.\n\n\n\nIn iOS 13 and later, adding a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers] key to the `Info.plist` disables the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/setMinimumBackgroundFetchInterval(_:)] methods.\n\n### Register, schedule, and run tasks\n\nFor each task, provide the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks\/BGTaskScheduler] object with a *launch handler* — a small block of code that runs the task — and a unique identifier. Register all of the tasks before the end of the app launch sequence. For more information, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/about-the-app-launch-sequence].\n\n\n\nThe following code registers a handler, `handleAppRefresh(task:)`, that’s called when the system runs a task request with the identifier `com.example.apple-samplecode.ColorFeed.refresh`.\n\nTo submit a task request for the system to launch your app in the background at a later time, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks\/BGTaskScheduler\/submit(_:)]. When you resubmit a task, the new submission replaces the previous submission.\n\nThe code below schedules a refresh task request for the task identifier `com.example.apple-samplecode.ColorFeed.refresh` that you previously registered.\n\nWhen the system opens your app in the background, it calls the launch handler to run the task.\n\nYour task provides an expiration handler that the system calls if it needs to terminate your task.

Expand the Background Modes section. If the target doesn’t have a Background Modes section, click + Capability, and then select Background Modes.\n4. If you’re using [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks\/BGAppRefreshTask], select “Background fetch.”\n5.

Add a new item to the list and choose “Permitted background task scheduler identifiers,” which corresponds to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers] array.\n4.
