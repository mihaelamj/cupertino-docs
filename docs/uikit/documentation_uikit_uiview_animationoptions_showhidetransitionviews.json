Both views must already be present in the parent view’s hierarchy when using this key. If this key is not present, the to-view in a transition is added to, and the from-view is removed from, the parent view’s list of subviews.\n\n## Constants\n\n- **layoutSubviews**: Lay out subviews at commit time so that they are animated along with their parent.\n- **allowUserInteraction**: Allow the user to interact with views while they are being animated.\n- **beginFromCurrentState**: Start the animation from the current setting associated with an already in-flight animation.\n- **repeat**: Repeat the animation indefinitely.\n- **autoreverse**: Run the animation backwards and forwards (must be combined with the repeat option).\n- **overrideInheritedDuration**: Force the animation to use the original duration value specified when the animation was submitted.\n- **overrideInheritedCurve**: Force the animation to use the original curve value specified when the animation was submitted.\n- **allowAnimatedContent**: Animate the views by changing the property values dynamically and redrawing the view.\n- **overrideInheritedOptions**: The option to not inherit the animation type or any options.\n- **curveEaseInOut**: Specify an ease-in ease-out curve, which causes the animation to begin slowly, accelerate through the middle of its duration, and then slow again before completing.\n- **curveEaseIn**: An ease-in curve causes the animation to begin slowly, and then speed up as it progresses.\n- **curveEaseOut**: An ease-out curve causes the animation to begin quickly, and then slow as it completes.\n- **curveLinear**: A linear animation curve causes an animation to occur evenly over its duration.\n- **transitionFlipFromLeft**: A transition that flips a view around its vertical axis from left to right (the left side of the view moves toward the front and right side toward the back).\n- **transitionFlipFromRight**: A transition that flips a view around its vertical axis from right to left (the right side of the view moves toward the front and left side toward the back).\n\n",
