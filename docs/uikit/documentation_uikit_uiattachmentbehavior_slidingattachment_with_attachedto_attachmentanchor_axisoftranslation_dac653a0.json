Both items start with the same anchor point, but as animations progress, each item’s anchor point is allowed to slide along the specified axis of translation independently. So if one item moves, it pushes the translation axis and the other item with it. The items do not rotate relative to the axis of translation or to each other, but the proximity of the items to one another varies depending on the movement of each item’s anchor point along the translation axis.\n\nThe axis of translation is infinitely long initially, but you can change the length by assigning a new value to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIAttachmentBehavior\/attachmentRange] property. When specifying a new attachment range, remember that the value in point represents the value `0` on the axis. Any new range you specify must include `0`.",
