  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nWhen the built-in UIKit gesture recognizers don’t provide the behavior you want, you can define custom gesture recognizers. UIKit defines highly configurable gesture recognizers to handle touch sequences for taps, long presses, pans, swipes, rotations, and pinches. For other touch sequences, or to handle gestures that involve button presses, you can define a custom gesture recognizer.\n\nYou might also use a custom gesture recognizer to simplify the event-handling code in your app. For example, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/leveraging-touch-input-for-drawing-apps] sample uses a gesture recognizer to capture input and display it onscreen, as shown in the following image.\n\n\n\nTo define a custom gesture recognizer, subclass [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer] (or one of its subclasses). At the top of your source file, import the `UIGestureRecognizerSubclass.h` header file (for Objective-C) or the `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizerSubclass` module (for Swift), as shown in the following code. This file defines the methods and properties that you must override to implement your custom gesture recognizer.\n\nIn your custom subclass, implement whatever methods you need to process events. For example, if your gesture consists of touch events, implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesBegan(_:with:)], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesMoved(_:with:)], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesEnded(_:with:)], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/touchesCancelled(_:with:)] methods. Use incoming events to update the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/state-swift.property] property of your gesture recognizer. UIKit uses the gesture recognizer states to coordinate interactions with other objects in your interface.",
