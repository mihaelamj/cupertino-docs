Depending on the features and frameworks that your app uses, the configuration process may require a few extra steps, such as manually excluding other frameworks or content.\n\n### Configure your app for Mac\n\nTo add support for Mac, open your Xcode project and select the iOS target that you want to configure. In the General tab, under Supported Destinations, click the Add button (+) to add a destination. Select Mac, then Mac Catalyst to add the destination.\n\n\n\nWhen you enable Mac support, Xcode adds the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Entitlements\/com.apple.security.app-sandbox] to your project. Xcode only includes this entitlement in the Mac version of your app, not the iOS version. Xcode also adds My Mac to the list of destinations. Select this destination to run your Mac app from Xcode.\n\nAt this point, you may be able to build and run the Mac version of your app. To give it a try, select My Mac as the destination and run your project.\n\n### Go beyond the checkbox\n\nYou may find that the Mac version of your app still doesn’t build because:\n\nWhen you enable Mac support, Xcode automatically excludes incompatible frameworks and embedded content where possible for Mac builds of your project. Still, you may need to manually exclude other frameworks or content.\n\nTo manually exclude an item, open Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content under the General tab for your iOS target. Then select only iOS under Filters for the item. This setting excludes the item from the Mac version of your app.\n\n\n\nIf you have source code referencing APIs unavailable to the Mac version of your app, enclose the code in a compilation conditional block that uses the `targetEnvironment()` (Swift) or `TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST` (Objective-C) platform condition.\n\nYou can use these same approaches to include a framework and code that are available only in macOS. For a framework, select macOS for the platform setting, and enclose the code with a `#if targetEnvironment(macCatalyst)` (Swift) or `#if TARGET_OS_MACCATALYST` (Objective-C) statement.\n\n### Make your app more like a Mac app\n\nAfter following these steps, you should be able to run your iPad app on Mac. But before you ship your new app to customers, it needs a few more changes to make it more like a Mac app. To learn more, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/optimizing-your-ipad-app-for-mac].",
