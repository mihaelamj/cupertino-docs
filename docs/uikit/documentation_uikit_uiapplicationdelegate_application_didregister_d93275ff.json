The system compares your app’s request with the user’s preferences to determine the types of local and remote notifications allowed, and returns the results to your app by calling this method. Check the contents of the `notificationSettings` parameter whenever this method is called.\n\nBecause the user can change notification settings in the Settings app at any time, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/currentUserNotificationSettings] method before your app performs work to prepare a notification for presentation.\n\nThe first time you register your app’s preferred notification types, the system asks the user whether your app should be allowed to deliver notifications and stores the user’s response. The system does not prompt the user on subsequent calls to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/registerUserNotificationSettings(_:)] method, but the user can always change notification preferences using Settings.\n\nA user’s notification settings control only whether the system *displays* local or remote notifications onscreen. Regardless of the notification settings, local and remote notifications are delivered to your app at the appropriate times.",
