  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nMac apps typically display app-specific preferences using a Preferences window accessible through the standard Preferences menu item under the app menu in the menu bar.\n\nMac apps built with Mac Catalyst that include a `Settings.bundle` file automatically get the Preferences menu item and a Preferences window. When a user selects the Preferences menu item, the system displays a Mac-friendly Preferences window based on the options provided in your Settings bundle. To learn about Settings bundles, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/UserDefaults\/Preferences\/Preferences.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/10000059i-CH6].\n\n### Add a Preferences window to your app\n\nTo include a Preferences window in your Mac app, add a `Settings.bundle` file to your Xcode project by pressing Command-N and selecting the Settings Bundle template from the Resources section under iOS. Then click Next to save the file to your project.\n\n\n\n### Add toolbar tabs to the Preferences window\n\nA Settings bundle can include one or more child panes that allow you to organize your preferences hierarchically (see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/UserDefaults\/Preferences\/Preferences.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/10000059i-CH6-SW4]). In iOS, the Settings app displays a child pane as a preference row. When the user taps the row, the app displays a new view showing the preferences defined in the child pane’s property list file.\n\nIn macOS, the Preferences window displays a child pane as a tab on the window’s toolbar. When the user clicks the tab, they see the preferences provided in the child pane’s property list file.\n\nThe tab for a child pane displays the pane’s title and a system-provided icon. To customize the icon, add the following key to the child pane’s property list file:\n\nYou must include the image file in the Settings bundle that contains the child pane’s property list file.\n\n### Confirm changes made with a toggle switch\n\nAnother element of the Settings bundle is the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/PreferenceSettings\/Conceptual\/SettingsApplicationSchemaReference\/Articles\/PSToggleSwitchSpecifier.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007012], which displays an ON\/OFF switch that the user can toggle. Your Mac app can prompt the user for a confirmation when they toggle the switch by including the following keys in the toggle switch element:\n\nEach dictionary contains the following keys that define the contents of the prompt:\n\n### Display subtitles for toggle switches\n\nSome iOS apps show descriptive text in a subtitle below a toggle switch using a group item with footer text. While the Preferences window supports this approach, the appearance on a Mac isn’t ideal. Instead, include the following key in the toggle switch element to show a subtitle:",
