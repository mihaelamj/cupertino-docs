Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPinchGestureRecognizer] class to detect pinch gestures.\n\nYou can attach a gesture recognizer in one of these ways:\n\n- Programmatically. Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/addGestureRecognizer(_:)] method of your view.\n- In Interface Builder. Drag the appropriate object from the library and drop it onto your view.\n\n\n\nA pinch gesture recognizer reports changes to the distance between two fingers touching the screen.

Image views and labels set this property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] by default.\n- At least two fingers are touching the screen.\n- You’re applying scale factors to your content correctly. Exponential growth of a value happens when you simply apply the scale factor to the current value.\n\n## Gestures\n\n- **Handling tap gestures**: Use brief taps on the screen to implement button-like interactions with your content.\n- **Handling long-press gestures**: Detect extended duration taps on the screen, and use them to reveal contextually relevant content.\n- **Handling pan gestures**: Trace the movement of fingers around the screen, and apply that movement to your content.\n- **Handling swipe gestures**: Detect a horizontal or vertical swipe motion on the screen, and use it to trigger navigation through your content.\n- **Handling rotation gestures**: Measure the relative rotation of two fingers on the screen, and use that motion to rotate your content.\n\n",
