That method is responsible for returning the view controller object that matches the indicated view controller. If you do not specify a restoration class for your view controller, the state restoration engine asks your app delegate to provide the view controller object instead.\n\nThe restoration class must conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewControllerRestoration] protocol.",
