The system calls a launch method (before calling this method) when a user selects a quick action for your app and your app *launches* instead of *activating*.\n\nThe requested quick action might employ code paths different than those used otherwise when your app launches. For example, your app normally launches to display view A, but your app was launched in response to a quick action that needs view B. To handle such cases, upon launch, check whether your app is being launched via a quick action. Perform this check in your [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] method by checking for the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/LaunchOptionsKey\/shortcutItem] launch option key. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationShortcutItem] object is available as the value of the launch option key.\n\nIf you find that your app was indeed launched using a quick action, perform the requested quick action within the launch method and return a value of [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] from that method.
