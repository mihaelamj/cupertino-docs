Then push the view controller onto the navigation stack.\n\n```swift\n\/\/ Create a detail view controller for the selected item.\nlet detailViewController = MyDetailViewController(itemID: itemID)\n\n\/\/ Set the preferred transition to zoom.\ndetailViewController.preferredTransition = .zoom { [self] _ in\n    \n    \/\/ Return the thumbnail view for the selected item.\n    return thumbnail(for: itemID)\n}\n\n\/\/ Push the detail view controller onto the navigation stack.\nnavigationController?.pushViewController(detailViewController, animated: true)\n```\n\n\n\nIf your app lets people swipe between different items without leaving the detail view, the thumbnail you want to zoom back to can change.

As it transitions to the *appeared* state, the system performs the following steps:\n\n1. Calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillAppear(_:)].\n2. Adds the controller’s view to the view hierarchy.\n3. Calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewIsAppearing(_:)].\n4. Transitions to the *appearing* state.\n5. Calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidAppear(_:)].\n6. Ends in the appeared state.\n\n\n\nWhen you pop a view controller off the navigation stack, it starts in the appeared state. The system then performs the following steps:\n\n1. Calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillDisappear(_:)].\n2. Transitions to the *disappearing* state.\n3. Removes the view from the view hierarchy.\n4. Calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidDisappear(_:)].\n5. Ends in the disappeared state.\n\n\n\nWhen someone interrupts the fluid zoom transition, the sequence of events changes. If a person cancels a navigation pop, the system calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillDisappear(_:)] and transitions to the disappearing state. At that point, the system transitions directly to the appearing state and calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidDisappear(_:)] before ending in the appeared state. This transition occurs within one cycle of the run loop, so new events can’t interrupt it.\n\n\n\nHowever, if someone interrupts a navigation push, the system doesn’t cancel push transitions. Instead, the system completes the transition to the appeared state and begins the navigation pop within one cycle of the run loop. The pop transition then proceeds as before, and either runs to completion or gets interrupted again.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Maintain seamless transitions\n\nWhen using continuously interactive transitions, your app needs to be ready for a new transition to start or stop at any time. Follow these guidelines to help your transitions run seamlessly and smoothly:\n\n- Don’t avoid starting a new navigation push or pop based on whether a transition is currently running. Let the new push or pop start, and the system handles the transitions.\n- Keep temporary transition state to a minimum, and avoid making other code dependent on that state.\n- Implement your callback methods so that the system can safely call them multiple times. The system might call these methods more than once before calling anything that uses or cleans up the results.\n- If you need to track some state during a transition, clean it up in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidAppear(_:)] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidDisappear(_:)]. The system calls these at the end of the transition.\n- If you’re using a navigation control delegate, you can use [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UINavigationControllerDelegate\/navigationController(_:willShow:animated:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UINavigationControllerDelegate\/navigationController(_:didShow:animated:)] to clean up instead of the view controller callback methods.\n\n",
