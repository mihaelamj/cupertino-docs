This value cannot be `nil`.\n- **index**: The index in the array of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/subviews] property at which to insert the view. Subview indices start at `0` and cannot be greater than the number of subviews.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method establishes a strong reference to `view` and sets its next responder to the receiver, which is its new superview.\n\nViews can have only one superview. If `view` already has a superview and that view is not the receiver, this method removes the previous superview before making the receiver its new superview.\n\n## Managing the view hierarchy\n\n- **superview**: The receiver’s superview, or `nil` if it has none.\n- **subviews**: The receiver’s immediate subviews.\n- **window**: The receiver’s window object, or `nil` if it has none.\n- **addSubview(_:)**: Adds a view to the end of the receiver’s list of subviews.\n- **bringSubviewToFront(_:)**: Moves the specified subview so that it appears on top of its siblings.\n- **sendSubviewToBack(_:)**: Moves the specified subview so that it appears behind its siblings.\n- **removeFromSuperview()**: Unlinks the view from its superview and its window, and removes it from the responder chain.\n- **insertSubview(_:aboveSubview:)**: Inserts a view above another view in the view hierarchy.\n- **insertSubview(_:belowSubview:)**: Inserts a view below another view in the view hierarchy.\n- **exchangeSubview(at:withSubviewAt:)**: Exchanges the subviews at the specified indices.\n- **isDescendant(of:)**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the receiver is a subview of a given view or identical to that view.\n\n",
