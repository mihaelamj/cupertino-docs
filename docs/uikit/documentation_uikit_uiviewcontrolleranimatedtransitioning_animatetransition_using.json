You can use view-based animations or Core Animation to configure your animations.\n\nAll animations must take place in the view specified by the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewControllerContextTransitioning\/containerView] property of `transitionContext`. Add the view being presented (or revealed if the transition involves dismissing a view controller) to the container view’s hierarchy and set up any animations you want to make that view move into position. If you want to draw to the screen directly without a view, use this method to configure a [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/CADisplayLink] object instead.\n\nYou can retrieve the view controllers involved in the transition from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewControllerContextTransitioning\/viewController(forKey:)] method of `transitionContext`.
