This equation means that the force equals the charge of the object multiplied by the strength of the electric field at the item’s current location in that field.\n\nYou can use electric fields as a way to apply forces to an object that are based on charge instead of mass. You can use electric fields to repel or attract items in your interface, with opposite charges attracting each other and similar charges repelling each other. In other words, an item with a positive charge value is attracted to fields whose [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFieldBehavior\/strength] value is negative and repelled by fields whose [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFieldBehavior\/strength] value is positive.",
