You might use a long-press gesture to initiate an action on the object being pressed. For example, you might use it to display a context-sensitive menu.\n\nYou can attach a gesture recognizer in one of these ways:\n\n- Programmatically. Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/addGestureRecognizer(_:)] method of your view.\n- In Interface Builder. Drag the appropriate object from the library and drop it onto your view.\n\n\n\nLong-press gestures are continuous gestures, meaning that your action method may be called multiple times as the state changes. After a person’s fingers have touched the screen for the minimum amount of time, a long-press gesture recognizer enters the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/began] state.
