A value of `1.0` corresponds to an acceleration of 1000 points \/ second², which is referred to as UIKit gravity and approximates the Earth’s own gravitational force. A value of `-1.0` represents the same amount of force, but in the opposite direction of the corresponding axis.\n\nThe default value of this property is the vector (`0.0, 1.0`), which represents a downward force in the reference view. Changing the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGravityBehavior\/angle] or [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGravityBehavior\/magnitude] values also changes the value of this property.",
