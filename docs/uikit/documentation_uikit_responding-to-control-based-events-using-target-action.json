  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUser interactions generate thousands of events for your app. Every swipe of the finger or button click, for instance, results in numerous events your app has to process.\n\n`Target-action` is a design pattern to help you handle these user interactions efficiently. By only registering actions against specific events on your controls, you simplify your event processing, while making your code more maintainable and easier to read.\n\nUse `target-action` to connect events directly from controls in your UI to methods in your code.\n\n### Designate an object to handle control-related events\n\nWhen a person interacts with your control, the control needs to know where to send the event. The destination for the event is the *target*. View controllers make good targets because they’re adept at handling user interactions, as well as hosting UI controls.\n\n\n\n### Define the action methods you use to respond to events\n\nWith a control assigned to the target, provide a function to call on that target when the event occurs. This is the *action* method.\n\nAction methods have a distinct signature:\n\nXcode uses the `@IBAction` keyword to connect controls in Interface Builder to functions in your code. The keyword also bridges the Swift and Objective-C runtimes, enabling Swift code to call into Objective-C, which is where the target-action functionality lives.\n\nThe `sender` parameter defines where the event comes from; for example, a button. Use the generic type `Any` to allow any control to call the action method, or specify the `sender` type when you need more information about the control for event processing. For example, set the `sender` type to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UISlider] to read the slider thumb value when someone moves the slider left or right.\n\nUIKit also supports coupling action methods to specific event types (see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/Event]). For example, to set up target-action for a user dragging their finger inside the bounds of a control, register for the event type [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/Event\/touchDragInside].\n\n### Connect controls to the action methods in Interface Builder\n\nWith the `target` and `action` methods defined, you’re ready to connect them visually to the controls in Interface Builder.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can verify that the control and action are connected by moving the pointer over the circular dot to the left of the action method. When you do, Xcode highlights the control.\n\n\n\nAnother way to connect is to Control-drag the control from Interface Builder into the view controller.\n\n\n\nEnter the name of the `action` method you’d like the control to call and then click Connect.\n\n\n\nThe following table lists the parameters available for configuration.\n\nConnecting the target-action this way ensures the method signature and parameters are correct as Xcode generates the action method for you.\n\n\n\n### Connect a control to your code programmatically\n\nIn UIKit, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIControl\/addTarget(_:action:for:)] method to set up target-action programmatically on a control:\n\nIn AppKit, use the control’s `target` and `action` properties to set target-action programmatically:\n\n### Enable other objects to respond to control-related events\n\nWhen the object hosting the control isn’t the one you want handling the event, invoke the responder chain by passing in `nil` as the target. This causes the control to search the responder chain for the specified action method and invoke it when found.
