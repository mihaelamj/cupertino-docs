The section provider keeps track of the index of the section that it’s currently creating, so you can configure each section differently.\n\nFor example, the following code shows a section provider that creates a two-column layout in the first section, and a four-column layout in each section after the first section.\n\nA section provider is also invoked in response to system events such as changes in device orientation, system font size, and size classes from iPad multitasking. You can use this opportunity to adapt the layout to different layout environments by inspecting information about the current layout environment ([doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/NSCollectionLayoutEnvironment]) and using that information to configure each section.\n\nFor example, the following code shows a section provider that creates a two-column layout when the width of the section’s container is less than 800 points, and a four-column layout otherwise.\n\nIn iOS 18 and later, UIKit supports automatic trait tracking inside this closure for traits from the `traitCollection` of the `layoutEnvironment` parameter.
