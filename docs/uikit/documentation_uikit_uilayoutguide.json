  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse layout guides to replace the placeholder views you may have created to represent inter-view spaces or encapsulation in your user interface. Traditionally, there were a number of Auto Layout techniques that required placeholder views. A placeholder view is an empty view that does not have any visual elements of its own and serves only to define a rectangular region in the view hierarchy. For example, if you wanted to use constraints to define the size or location of an empty space between views, you needed to use a placeholder view to represent that space. If you wanted to center a group of objects, you needed a placeholder view to contain those objects. Similarly, placeholder views could be used to contain and encapsulate part of your user interface. Placeholder views let you break up a large, complex user interface into self-contained, modular chunks. When used properly, they could greatly simplify your Auto Layout constraint logic.\n\nThere are a number of costs associated with adding placeholder views to your view hierarchy. First, there is the cost of creating and maintaining the view itself. Second, the placeholder view is a full member of the view hierarchy, which means that it adds overhead to every task the hierarchy performs. Worst of all, the invisible placeholder view can intercept messages that are intended for other views, causing problems that are very difficult to find.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UILayoutGuide] class is designed to perform all the tasks previously performed by placeholder views, but to do it in a safer, more efficient manner. Layout guides do not define a new view. They do not participate in the view hierarchy. Instead, they simply define a rectangular region in their owning view’s coordinate system that can interact with Auto Layout.\n\n### Creating Layout Guides\n\nTo create a layout guide, you must perform the following steps:\n\nYou can use these guides to define the space between elements in your layout.
