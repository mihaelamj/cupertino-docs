The drag item, in turn, uses an *item provider*. Your app populates the item provider’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSItemProvider\/registeredTypeIdentifiers] array with [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/content\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/DevPedia-CocoaCore\/UniformTypeIdentifier.html].\n\n\n\nThe array of UTIs constitutes the source app’s promise about the specific data representations it can deliver, on request, to a destination app. The term *promise* means that, at the time your app constructs a drag item, it commits to providing certain data representations but doesn’t yet perform the work to create them. Although it appears to the user that the item itself is being dragged, the drag item instead consists of promises along with a preview image that remains under the user’s touch point onscreen.\n\nThe portion of your app that constructs the drag item is the *drag interaction delegate* ([doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDragInteractionDelegate]).
