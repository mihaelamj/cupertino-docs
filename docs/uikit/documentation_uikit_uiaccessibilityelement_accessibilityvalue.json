For example, the value of a slider might be 9.5 or 35% and the value of a text field is the text it contains.\n\nUse the value property only when an accessibility element can have a value that is not represented by its label. For example, a volume slider’s label might be “Volume,” but its value is the current volume level. In this case, it’s not enough for users to know the identity of the slider, because they also need to know its current value. The label of a Save button, on the other hand, tells users everything they need to know about the control; supplying the word “Save” as a value would be unnecessary and confusing.",
