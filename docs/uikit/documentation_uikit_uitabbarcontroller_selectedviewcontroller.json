Assigning a new view controller to this property changes the currently displayed view and also selects an appropriate tab in the tab bar. Changing the view controller also updates the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITabBarController\/selectedIndex] property accordingly.

You can also use it to select the More navigation controller itself, which is available from the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITabBarController\/moreNavigationController] property. Prior to iOS 3.0, you could select only the More navigation controller and the subset of view controllers whose tab bar item was visible.
