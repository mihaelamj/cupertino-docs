You can override this method to perform custom tasks associated with displaying the view. For example, you might use this method to change the orientation or style of the status bar to coordinate with the orientation or style of the view being presented. If you override this method, you must call `super` at some point in your implementation.\n\nFor more information about the how views are added to view hierarchies by a view controller, and the sequence of messages that occur, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/featuredarticles\/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS\/SupportingAccessibility.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007457-CH12].",
