The range of each offset value is `-1` to `1`. When the device’s screen is pointed directly at the user, the offset values are (0, 0). Rotating the phone so that the screen points down or to the right of the viewer yields a positive value. Rotating the phone so that the screen points above the user or to the user’s left yields a negative value.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA dictionary containing one or more key path strings representing the properties of the view to modify.
