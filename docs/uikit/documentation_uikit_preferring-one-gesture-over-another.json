  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nFor any two gesture recognizers involved in a potential conflict, only one needs an associated delegate object, and that object must conform to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizerDelegate] protocol. In your delegate, implement the methods you need for the appropriate resolution. The best way to see how to use these methods is with a few examples.\n\nThe following code shows how to recognize tap and double-tap gestures in the same view. The view in this example has two [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITapGestureRecognizer] objects, one of which is configured to require two taps. Normally, the single-tap gesture would always be recognized before the double-tap gesture, but you can use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizerDelegate\/gestureRecognizer(_:shouldRequireFailureOf:)] method to reverse that behavior. The implementation of this method prevents the single-tap gesture from being recognized until after the double-tap gesture recognizer explicitly reaches the failed state, which happens when the touch sequence contains only one tap.\n\nThe following code shows how to recognize a swipe gesture before a pan gesture. In this case, the delegate object is attached to the swipe gesture recognizer and implements the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizerDelegate\/gestureRecognizer(_:shouldBeRequiredToFailBy:)] method. The logic of this method prevents the pan gesture from being recognized until the swipe gesture fails.\n\nThe following code shows an alternative way to configure the dependency between a swipe and a pan gesture. Instead of attaching a delegate object to the swipe gesture, this example attaches the delegate to the pan gesture. Because of the change, the delegate must now implement the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizerDelegate\/gestureRecognizer(_:shouldRequireFailureOf:)] method and require the swipe to fail. The end results are the same as those from the previous example.\n\nThe ability to attach a delegate to any gesture recognizer lets you create complex dependency chains among your gestures.
