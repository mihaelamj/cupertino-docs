This method is your opportunity to replace the current view controller with one that is better suited for the new presentation style. For example, you might use this method to insert a navigation controller into your view hierarchy to facilitate pushing new view controllers more easily in the compact environment. In that instance, you would return a navigation controller whose root view controller is the currently presented view controller. You could also return an entirely different view controller if you prefer.\n\nIf you do not implement this method or your implementation returns `nil`, the presentation controller uses its existing presented view controller.",
