The animator operates on animatable properties of views, such as the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/frame], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/center], [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/alpha], and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/transform] properties, creating the needed animations from the blocks you provide.\n\nWhen creating a property animator object, you specify the following:\n\nIn your animation blocks, set the value of an animatable property to the final value you want reflected by that view.

For example, if you want to fade out a view, you would set its alpha property to `0` in your block.

Specifically, you can:\n\n- Start, pause, resume, and stop animations; see the methods of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimating] protocol.\n- Add animation blocks after the original animations start using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewPropertyAnimator\/addAnimations(_:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewPropertyAnimator\/addAnimations(_:delayFactor:)] methods.\n- Scrub through a paused animation by modifying the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimating\/fractionComplete] property.\n- Change the animation’s direction using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimating\/isReversed] property.\n- Modify the timing and duration of a partially complete animation by pausing the animation and using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewPropertyAnimator\/continueAnimation(withTimingParameters:durationFactor:)] method to finish it.\n\nMost of the basic behavior is controlled by the properties of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimating] protocol, which this class adopts. Use those methods and properties to start, pause, resume, and stop the animations. You can also use them to scrub through the animation and change its direction.
