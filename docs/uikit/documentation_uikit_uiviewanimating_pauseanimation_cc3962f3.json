Calling this method on an inactive animator moves its state to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimatingState\/active] and puts its animations in a paused state right away. To resume the animations, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimating\/startAnimation()] method. If the animation is already paused, this method should do nothing. It is a programmer error to call this method while the state of the animator is set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewAnimatingState\/stopped].",
