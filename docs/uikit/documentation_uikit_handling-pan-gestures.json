A screen-edge pan gesture is a specialized pan gesture that originates from the edge of the screen. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPanGestureRecognizer] class for pan gestures and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer] class for screen-edge pan gestures.\n\nYou can attach a gesture recognizer in one of these ways:\n\n- Programmatically. Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/addGestureRecognizer(_:)] method of your view.\n- In Interface Builder. Drag the appropriate object from the library and drop it onto your view.\n\n\n\nUse pan gesture recognizers for tasks that require you to track the movement of the user’s fingers onscreen. You might use a pan gesture recognizer to drag objects around in your interface or update their appearance based on the position of the user’s finger.
