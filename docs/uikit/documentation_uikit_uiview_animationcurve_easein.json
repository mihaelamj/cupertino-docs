This is the default curve for most animations.\n- **UIView.AnimationCurve.easeOut**: An ease-out curve causes the animation to begin quickly, and then slow down as it completes.\n- **UIView.AnimationCurve.linear**: A linear animation curve causes an animation to occur evenly over its duration.\n\n",
