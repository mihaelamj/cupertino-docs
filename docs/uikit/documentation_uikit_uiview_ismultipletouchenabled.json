When set to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], the view receives only the first touch event in a multi-touch sequence that start within the view’s bounds. The default value of this property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false].\n\nOther views in the same window can still receive touch events when this property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false]. If you want this view to handle multi-touch events exclusively, set the values of both this property and the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/isExclusiveTouch] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true]. This property does not prevent a view from being asked to handle multiple touches. For example, two subviews may both forward their touches to a common parent, such as a window or the root view of a view controller. This property determines how many touches initially targeting the view are delivered to that view.",
