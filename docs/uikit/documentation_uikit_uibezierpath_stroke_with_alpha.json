Values can range between `0.0` (transparent) and `1.0` (opaque). Values outside this range are clamped to `0.0` or `1.0`.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe drawn line is centered on the path with its sides parallel to the path segment. This method applies the current stroke color and drawing properties (plus the specified blend mode and transparency value) to the rendered path.\n\nThis method automatically saves the current graphics state prior to drawing and restores that state when it is done, so you do not have to save the graphics state yourself.\n\n## Drawing paths\n\n- **fill()**: Uses the current drawing properties to paint the region that the path encloses.\n- **fill(with:alpha:)**: Uses the specified blend mode and transparency values to paint the region that the path encloses.\n- **stroke()**: Draws a line along the path using the current drawing properties.\n\n",
