Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIRotationGestureRecognizer] class to detect rotation gestures.\n\nYou can attach a gesture recognizer in one of these ways:\n\n- Programmatically. Call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/addGestureRecognizer(_:)] method of your view.\n- In Interface Builder. Drag the appropriate object from the library and drop it onto your view.\n\n\n\nUse a rotation gesture recognizer when you want to use rotational movements as input to your app. Rotational gestures are commonly used to manipulate objects onscreen. For example, you might use them to rotate a view or update the value of a custom control. Rotation gestures are continuous, so your action method is called whenever the rotation value changes, giving you a chance to update your content.\n\nThe gesture recognizer reports rotation values in radians.

The gesture recognizer measures the angle between the initial line and each new line and places the resulting value in its [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIRotationGestureRecognizer\/rotation] property.\n\nA rotation gesture recognizer enters the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/began] state as soon as the position of a person’s fingers changes in a way that indicates that rotation has begun.

When a person’s fingers lift from the screen, the gesture recognizer enters the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIGestureRecognizer\/State-swift.enum\/ended] state.\n\n\n\nThe following code demonstrates how to rotate a view in a way that follows a person’s fingers. This action method applies the current rotation factor to the view’s transform and then resets the gesture recognizer’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIRotationGestureRecognizer\/rotation] property to `0.0`.

Image views and labels set this property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] by default.\n- At least two fingers are touching the screen.\n- You’re applying rotation factors to your content correctly. Over-rotation happens when you apply the same rotation value more than once. To fix this problem, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIRotationGestureRecognizer\/rotation] property to `0.0` after applying the current rotation value to your content.\n\n## Gestures\n\n- **Handling tap gestures**: Use brief taps on the screen to implement button-like interactions with your content.\n- **Handling long-press gestures**: Detect extended duration taps on the screen, and use them to reveal contextually relevant content.\n- **Handling pan gestures**: Trace the movement of fingers around the screen, and apply that movement to your content.\n- **Handling swipe gestures**: Detect a horizontal or vertical swipe motion on the screen, and use it to trigger navigation through your content.\n- **Handling pinch gestures**: Track the distance between two fingers and use that information to scale or zoom your content.\n\n",
