The original image is also returned in the `info` parameter.\n\nIf you set the image picker’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImagePickerController\/showsCameraControls] property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] and provide your own custom controls, you can take multiple pictures before dismissing the image picker interface.
