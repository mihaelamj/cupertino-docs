When the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIImageView\/adjustsImageWhenAncestorFocused] property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true], the overlay view receives the same floating effects as the image view when it’s focused.\n\nThe view in this property clips its subviews to its bounds rectangle by default, but you can change that behavior using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/clipsToBounds] property.",
