The interface also lets the user rearrange items on the tab bar, but it does not let the user change the total number of items. The interface includes a Done button that automatically dismisses the interface. You can also dismiss the interface programmatically using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITabBar\/endCustomizing(animated:)] method.\n\nThe `items` parameter should include all items currently visible in the tab bar that you allow to be replaced. Any currently visible items that are not included in this array remain fixed in place on the tab bar and cannot be repositioned or replaced by the user. If the user removes the currently selected item from the tab bar, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITabBar\/selectedItem] property is set to `nil`.\n\nThe tab bar notifies its delegate about the pending customizations at various points during the presentation and dismissal of the interface. If you want to track when customizations begin and end, provide a delegate and assign it to the tab bar’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITabBar\/delegate] property.
