For example, the app notifies its delegate when the app finishes launching and when its foreground or background execution status changes. Similarly, app-related messages coming from the system are often routed to the app delegate for handling. Xcode provides an initial app delegate for every app and you should not need to change this delegate later.\n\nThe delegate must adopt the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate] formal protocol.",
