For tasks that require more background time, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BackgroundTasks].\n\nWhen your app moves to the background, the system calls your app delegate’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)] method. That method has five seconds to perform any tasks and return. Shortly after that method returns, the system puts your app into the suspended state. For most apps, five seconds is enough to perform any crucial tasks, but if you need more time, you can ask UIKit to extend your app’s runtime.\n\nYou extend your app’s runtime by calling the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/beginBackgroundTask(withName:expirationHandler:)] method. Calling this method gives you extra time to perform important tasks. (You can find out the maximum background time available using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/backgroundTimeRemaining] property.) When you finish your tasks, call the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/endBackgroundTask(_:)] method right away to let the system know that you’re done. If you don’t end your tasks in a timely manner, the system terminates your app.\n\nThe following code shows an example that configures a background task so that the app may save data to its server, which could take longer than five seconds. The [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/beginBackgroundTask(withName:expirationHandler:)] method returns an identifier that you must save and pass to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/endBackgroundTask(_:)] method.",
