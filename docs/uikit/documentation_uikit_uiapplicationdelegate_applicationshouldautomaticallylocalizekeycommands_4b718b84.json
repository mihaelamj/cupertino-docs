The system doesn’t remap shortcuts when the input keys have identical positions on both keyboards, or when a shortcut is still easily reachable on the current keyboard. The remapping is transparent to your app.\n\nIf you already localize your app’s key-command shortcuts for different languages, or if you allow someone to customize your app’s shortcuts, you can return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] to disable the automatic remapping behavior.
