You might do this when your data source object receives data for new items or in response to user interactions with the collection view. The collection view gets the layout information for the new cells as part of calling this method. And if the layout information indicates that the cells should appear onscreen, the collection view asks your data source to provide the appropriate views, animating them into position as needed.\n\nYou can also call this method from a block passed to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICollectionView\/performBatchUpdates(_:completion:)] method when you want to animate multiple separate changes into place at the same time.
