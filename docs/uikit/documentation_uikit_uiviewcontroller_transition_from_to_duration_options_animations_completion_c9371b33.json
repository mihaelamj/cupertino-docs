If you pass zero, the changes are made without animating them.\n- **options**: A mask of options indicating how you want to perform the animations. For a list of valid constants, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/AnimationOptions].\n- **animations**: A block object containing the changes to commit to the views. Here you programmatically change any animatable properties of the views in your view hierarchy. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be `NULL`.\n- **completion**: A block to be called when the animation completes.\n\nThe block takes the following parameters:\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method adds the second view controller’s view to the view hierarchy and then performs the animations defined in your animations block. After the animation completes, it removes the first view controller’s view from the view hierarchy.\n\nThis method is only intended to be called by an implementation of a custom container view controller. If you override this method, you must call `super` in your implementation.\n\n## Managing child view controllers in a custom container\n\n- **children**: An array of view controllers that are children of the current view controller.\n- **addChild(_:)**: Adds the specified view controller as a child of the current view controller.\n- **removeFromParent()**: Removes the view controller from its parent.\n- **shouldAutomaticallyForwardAppearanceMethods**: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether appearance methods are forwarded to child view controllers.\n- **beginAppearanceTransition(_:animated:)**: Tells a child controller its appearance is about to change.\n- **endAppearanceTransition()**: Tells a child controller its appearance has changed.\n- **hierarchyInconsistencyException**: Raised if the view controller hierarchy is inconsistent with the view hierarchy.\n\n",
