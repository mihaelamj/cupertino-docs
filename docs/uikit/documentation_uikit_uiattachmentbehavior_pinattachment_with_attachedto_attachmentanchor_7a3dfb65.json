Each item is free to rotate around the anchor point, inscribing a circle whose radius is the defined at creation time by the distance between `point` and the item’s center. When forces act on one or both items, the anchor point and other item also move accordingly. The anchor point of the attachment does not interact with collision boundaries.\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIAttachmentBehavior\/frictionTorque] property to control the rotational behavior of the items. When the value of that property is `0`, items rotate freely in response to almost any impulse. Adding torque increases the amount of force that must be applied to an item before it rotates.\n\nUse the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIAttachmentBehavior\/attachmentRange] property to limit the amount of rotation for each item. This property lets you specify the minimum and maximum amount of rotation of the items from their starting positions.",
