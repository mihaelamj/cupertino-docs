The total number of crossed path lines (including implicit path lines) and the direction of each path line are then interpreted as follows:\n\n- For the even-odd rule, if the total number of path crossings is odd, the point is considered to be inside the path and the corresponding region is filled. If the number of crossings is even, the point is considered to be outside the path and the region is not filled.\n- For the non-zero rule, the crossing of a left-to-right path counts as +1 and the crossing of a right-to-left path counts as -1. If the sum of the crossings is nonzero, the point is considered to be inside the path and the corresponding region is filled. If the sum is 0, the point is outside the path and the region is not filled.\n\nThe default value of this property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false].
