That method always returns a valid view object. Upon receiving the view, you should set any properties that correspond to the data you want to display, perform any additional needed configuration, and return the view.\n\nYou do not need to set the location of the supplementary view inside the collection view’s bounds. The collection view sets the location of each view using the layout attributes provided by its layout object.\n\nThis method must always return a valid view object. If you do not want a supplementary view in a particular case, your layout object should not create the attributes for that view. Alternatively, you can hide views by setting the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes\/isHidden] property of the corresponding attributes to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] or set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes\/alpha] property of the attributes to 0.
