To obtain a view that is as small as possible, specify the constant [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/layoutFittingCompressedSize]. To obtain a view that is as large as possible, specify the constant [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/layoutFittingExpandedSize].\n- **horizontalFittingPriority**: The priority for horizontal constraints. Specify [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UILayoutPriority\/fittingSizeLevel] to get a width that is as close as possible to the width value of `targetSize`.\n- **verticalFittingPriority**: The priority for vertical constraints. Specify [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UILayoutPriority\/fittingSizeLevel] to get a height that is as close as possible to the height value of `targetSize`.\n\n## Return Value\n\nThe optimal size for the view based on the provided constraint priorities.\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method when you want to prioritize the view’s constraints when determining the best possible size of the view.
