  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nThis sample project demonstrates how to add menu commands and keyboard shortcuts to the menu bar. The sample app uses its `MenuController` object to insert a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIMenuSystem] object that adds the following menus:\n\nThe sample project also shows you how to add contextual menus to views, and how to handle menu-command selection using [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate].\n\n### Configure the sample code project\n\nIn Xcode, select your development team on the iOS target’s Signing and Capabilities tab.\n\n### Add menus to the menu bar\n\nCreate `UIMenu` objects and use them to construct the menus and submenus. This sample adds menus to the menu bar when it runs on macOS, and key command elements in those menus also appear in the discoverability heads-up display (HUD) on iPad when the user presses the command key.\n\nThe Mac version of an iPad app comes with a standard menu bar. Use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIMenuSystem] class, an object that represents the main or contextual menu system, to modify the menu bar.\n\nThe sample uses `UIMenuSystem` to add menus and key commands to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIMenuSystem\/main] system menu by implementing [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/buildMenu(with:)] in `AppDelegate`. This function receives a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIMenuBuilder] object that the sample then uses to add and remove menus. Because menus can exist with no window or view hierarchy, the system only consults `UIApplication` and `UIApplicationDelegate` to build the app’s menu bar.\n\nMenu commands consist of `UICommand`, `UIKeyCommand`, and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIAction] objects that are grouped in a `UIMenu` container.\n\n### Add menu commands to the file menu\n\nThis sample inserts a `UIKeyCommand` called Command-O into the File Menu and creates a corresponding keyboard shortcut:\n\nNotice that the `UIKeyCommand` title is a localized string using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Foundation\/NSLocalizedString] function, which can display the menu name in multiple languages.\n\nThis sample inserts the Open command into the middle of the menu bar’s File menu:\n\nMac apps also typically include a Print menu command in the File menu. This sample includes both Print and Export as PDF menu commands in the File Menu. These menu commands are automatically inserted when the `Info.plist` contains the `UIApplicationSupportsPrintCommand` key whose value is set to `true`. The application responds to these print commands by implementing `UIResponder's` `printContent(_ sender: Any?)` function.\n\n### Contribute to the edit menu\n\nEditing operations, such as cut, copy, paste, and delete, are commonly used in most apps. This sample app provides these operations through the Edit menu, where the user can edit the sample’s left-side content or its primary table-view content. These operations represent the first-responder functions `cut(_ sender: Any?)`, `copy(_ sender: Any?)`, `paste(_ sender: Any?)`, `delete(_ sender: Any?)`.\n\nThis sample implements `canPerformAction:withSender:` to determine if these edit operations are supported.\n\n### Add commands to control the user interface\n\nIn the sample, you can change the primary or left-side table view’s selection by using [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIKeyCommand]. These key commands are connected to the up and down arrow keys and are added directly to the table view. The following example shows how to add the down arrow key as a `UIKeyCommand`:\n\nThe sample also demonstrates how to add menu commands as command-key equivalents. The following example shows how to create a menu with all four arrow keys as command keys:\n\n### Display contextual menus\n\nThe sample displays a contextual menu through the use of `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate`, an interaction object used to display relevant actions for the content.\n\nFor macOS, the user control-clicks or right-clicks the `DetailViewController`. For iPadOS, the user taps and holds the `DetailViewController`. The sample uses `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate` to display Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Rename, and Share commands. This kind of contextual menu is a grouping of `UIAction` objects. `UIAction` is a menu element that performs its action in a closure. In iOS, optionally customize this contextual menu’s highlight preview by using [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate\/contextMenuInteraction(_:previewForHighlightingMenuWithConfiguration:)]. This delegate function returns a primary view controller. Override this function to enable menu commands based on the table view state or the state of the pasteboard.\n\n### Adjust the style menu\n\nThe sample implements [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIResponder\/validate(_:)], where it can adjust the Style menu as the user selects between one or more font styles: plain, bold, italic, underline.\n\n### Add a preferences menu\n\nMac apps typically display app-specific preferences using a preferences window. The sample adds a preferences window by adding a Settings bundle to the Xcode project’s target. The window automatically becomes available to the user through the Preferences menu command in the Application menu. To learn more about preferences, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/displaying-a-preferences-window].",

The sample app uses its `MenuController` object to insert a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIMenuSystem] object that adds the following menus:\n\n- New: Appears at the beginning of the File menu and contains the two operations New Date Item and New Text Item, which add items to the table view.\n- Cities: Contains a group of UICommand and UIKeyCommand objects.\n- Navigation: Contains a group of UIKeyCommand objects for command-key navigation.\n- Style: Contains a group of UICommand objects that have checkmark states. This grouping looks like a font-style menu for text formatting.\n- Tools: Contains a group of UICommand objects.\n\nThe sample project also shows you how to add contextual menus to views, and how to handle menu-command selection using [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate].\n\n### Configure the sample code project\n\nIn Xcode, select your development team on the iOS target’s Signing and Capabilities tab.\n\n### Add menus to the menu bar\n\nCreate `UIMenu` objects and use them to construct the menus and submenus.

This sample includes both Print and Export as PDF menu commands in the File Menu. These menu commands are automatically inserted when the `Info.plist` contains the `UIApplicationSupportsPrintCommand` key whose value is set to `true`.

These key commands are connected to the up and down arrow keys and are added directly to the table view. The following example shows how to add the down arrow key as a `UIKeyCommand`:\n\n```swift\nlet downArrowCommand =\n    UIKeyCommand(input: UIKeyCommand.inputDownArrow,\n                 modifierFlags: [],\n                 action: #selector(PrimaryViewController.downArrowAction(_:)))\naddKeyCommand(downArrowCommand)\n```\n\nThe sample also demonstrates how to add menu commands as command-key equivalents. The following example shows how to create a menu with all four arrow keys as command keys:\n\n```swift\nclass func navigationMenu() -> UIMenu {\n    let keyCommands = [ UIKeyCommand.inputRightArrow,\n                        UIKeyCommand.inputLeftArrow,\n                        UIKeyCommand.inputUpArrow,\n                        UIKeyCommand.inputDownArrow ]\n    let arrows = Arrows.allCases\n    \n    let arrowKeyChildrenCommands = zip(keyCommands, arrows).map { (command, arrow) in\n        UIKeyCommand(title: arrow.localizedString(),\n                     image: nil,\n                     action: #selector(AppDelegate.navigationMenuAction(_:)),\n                     input: command,\n                     modifierFlags: .command,\n                     propertyList: [CommandPListKeys.ArrowsKeyIdentifier: arrow.rawValue])\n    }\n    \n    let arrowKeysGroup = UIMenu(title: \"\",\n                  image: nil,\n                  identifier: .arrowsMenu,\n                  options: .displayInline,\n                  children: arrowKeyChildrenCommands)\n    \n    return UIMenu(title: NSLocalizedString(\"NavigationTitle\", comment: \"\"),\n                  image: nil,\n                  identifier: .navMenu,\n                  options: [],\n                  children: [arrowKeysGroup])\n}\n```\n\n### Display contextual menus\n\nThe sample displays a contextual menu through the use of `UIContextMenuInteractionDelegate`, an interaction object used to display relevant actions for the content.\n\nFor macOS, the user control-clicks or right-clicks the `DetailViewController`.
