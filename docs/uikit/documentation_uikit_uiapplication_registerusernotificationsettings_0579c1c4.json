(You must also make this request if you want to set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/applicationIconBadgeNumber] property directly.) Typically, you make this request if your app uses local or remote notifications to alert the user to new information involving your app. The first time your app launches and calls this method, the system asks the user whether your app should be allowed to deliver notifications and stores the response. Thereafter, the system uses the stored response to determine the actual types of notifications you may use.\n\nAfter calling this method, the app calls the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didRegister:)] method of its app delegate to report the results. You can use that method to determine if your request was granted or denied by the user.\n\nIt is recommended that you call this method before you schedule any local notifications or register with the push notification service.
