You might use this object to provide different ending attributes based on the starting layout object.\n\n## Discussion\n\nPrior to performing a layout transition, the collection view calls this method so that your layout object can perform any initial calculations needed to generate layout attributes.\n\n## Transitioning between layouts\n\n- **prepareForTransition(to:)**: Tells the layout object that it is about to be removed as the layout for the collection view.\n- **finalizeLayoutTransition()**: Tells the layout object to perform any final steps before the transition animations occur.\n\n",
