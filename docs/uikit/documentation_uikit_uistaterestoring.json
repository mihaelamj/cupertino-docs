The methods of the protocol let you save enough information about the object to find or recreate it during the next launch cycle.\n\nWhen adopting this protocol in your custom objects, you must also remember to register those objects using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/registerObject(forStateRestoration:restorationIdentifier:)] method of the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication] class. You don’t need to register views or view controllers explicitly because UIKit registers those objects automatically. View controllers adopt this protocol so that they may be used as the restoration parent of one of your custom objects.",
