This might occur when the user tries to change the editing focus to another control. Before the focus actually changes, however, the text view calls this method to give your delegate a chance to decide whether it should.\n\nNormally, you would return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] from this method to allow the text view to resign the first responder status. You might return [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false], however, in cases where your delegate wants to validate the contents of the text view.
