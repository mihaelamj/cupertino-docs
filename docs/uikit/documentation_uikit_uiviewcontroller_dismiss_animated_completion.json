If you call this method on the presented view controller itself, UIKit asks the presenting view controller to handle the dismissal.\n\nIf you present several view controllers in succession, thus building a stack of presented view controllers, calling this method on a view controller lower in the stack dismisses its immediate child view controller and all view controllers above that child on the stack. When this happens, only the top-most view is dismissed in an animated fashion; any intermediate view controllers are simply removed from the stack. The top-most view is dismissed using its modal transition style, which may differ from the styles used by other view controllers lower in the stack.\n\nIf you want to retain a reference to the view controller’s presented view controller, get the value in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/presentedViewController] property before calling this method.\n\nThe completion handler is called after the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidDisappear(_:)] method is called on the presented view controller.",
