If you return `true` from this callback, Scribble waits until the user pauses briefly while writing. This is useful in cases where the view shifts or transforms when becoming first responder, which can be disruptive to a user trying to write in the field.\n\nIt’s preferable to adjust the UI behavior and minimize these kinds transformations to avoid the layout changes. Only use this method as a last resort, since transcription happens all at once instead of incrementally.",
