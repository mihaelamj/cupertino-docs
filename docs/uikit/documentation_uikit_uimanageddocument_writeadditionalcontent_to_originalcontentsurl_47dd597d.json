There are several issues to consider:\n\n- You should typically implement this method only if you also implemented [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIManagedDocument\/additionalContent(for:)].\n- Because this method is executed asynchronously, it’s possible that the document’s state may be different from that at which the save operation was initiated. If you need to capture the document state at save time, you should do so in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIManagedDocument\/additionalContent(for:)].\n- If you implement this method, it’s invoked automatically by [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIDocument\/writeContents(_:andAttributes:safelyTo:for:)].\n- There’s no need to invoke `super`’s implementation.\n\n\n\n### Special considerations\n\nAdditional content isn’t supported on iCloud.\n\n## Customizing read and write operations\n\n- **readAdditionalContent(from:)**: Handles reading non-Core Data content in the additional content directory in the document’s file package.\n- **additionalContent(for:)**: Handles writing non-Core Data content to the additional content directory in the document’s file package.\n\n",
