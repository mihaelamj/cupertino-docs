Ensure that the app is selected as a target. You can use any sound file that conforms to the standard iOS sound file formats and is less than 30 seconds long.

Before registering the sound file, you must create an identifier for the sound using [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFocusSoundIdentifier]. The identifier must be unique for the app. After creating an identifier, locate the sound file in your app bundle and register the sound file using [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFocusSystem\/register(_:forSoundIdentifier:)].\n\n```swift\nlet myPing = UIFocusSoundIdentifier.init(rawValue: \"customPing\")\nlet soundURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: \"ping\", withExtension: \"aif\")!\nUIFocusSystem.register(_: soundURL, forSoundIdentifier: myPing)\n```\n\nThere are a few things to remember when registering your sound file:\n\n- Register the sound file early in your app’s lifecycle. The cost to prepare a sound for playback is nontrivial, so you want the sound to be fully prepared by the time a focus update occurs.\n- You can register multiple sound files in your app.\n- Register each sound file once. Registering a previously registered sound file results in an error that causes an immediate assertion failure.\n- See the [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2017\/224\/] for information about which focus sound is played when an item becomes focused.\n\n### Override the default focus sounds\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFocusEnvironment\/soundIdentifierForFocusUpdate(in:)] function is called when focus changes. The default focus sound is played when this function isn’t implemented. Override the function to play your custom sounds when focus changes.\n\n```swift\noverride func soundIdentifierForFocusUpdate(in context: UIFocusUpdateContext) -> UIFocusSoundIdentifier? {    \n    return myPing\n}\n```\n\n## Getting the sound to play during updates\n\n- **soundIdentifierForFocusUpdate(in:)**: Asks the delegate for the identifier of the sound to play when the object gains focus.\n- **UIFocusSoundIdentifier**: An identifier for a focus-related sound.\n\n",
