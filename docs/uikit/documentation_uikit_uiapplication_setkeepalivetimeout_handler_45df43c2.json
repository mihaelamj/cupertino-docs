The minimum acceptable timeout value is 600 seconds.\n- **keepAliveHandler**: A block that performs the tasks needed to maintain your VoIP network connection. Setting this parameter to `nil` releases the current handler block and prevents UIKit from scheduling the next wake.\n\n## Return Value\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] if the handler was installed or [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] if it was not.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn iOS 8 and later, voice-over-IP (VoIP) apps register for [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/registerForRemoteNotifications()] remote notifications instead of using this method.
