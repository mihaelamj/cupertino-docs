(In tvOS, the safe area reflects the area not covered by the screen’s bezel.) You obtain the safe area for a view by applying the insets in this property to the view’s bounds rectangle. If the view is not currently installed in a view hierarchy, or is not yet visible onscreen, the edge insets in this property are `0`.\n\nFor the view controller’s root view, the insets account for the status bar, other visible bars, and any additional insets that you specified using the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/additionalSafeAreaInsets] property of your view controller. For other views in the view hierarchy, the insets reflect only the portion of the view that is covered. For example, if a view is entirely within the safe area of its superview, the edge insets in this property are `0`.\n\nYou might use this property at runtime to adjust the position of your view’s content programmatically.",
