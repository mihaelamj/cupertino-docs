An app can create and schedule a local notification, and the operating system then delivers it at the scheduled date and time. If the app is not active in the foreground when the notification fires, the system uses the information in the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UILocalNotification] object to determine whether it should display an alert, badge the app icon, or play a sound. If the app is running in the foreground, the system calls this method directly without alerting the user in any way.\n\nYou might implement this method in your delegate if you want to be notified that a local notification occurred. For example, a calendar app might use local notifications to alert the user to upcoming events.\n\nIf the user chooses to open the app when a local notification occurs, the launch options dictionary passed to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)] methods contains the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/LaunchOptionsKey\/localNotification] key.
