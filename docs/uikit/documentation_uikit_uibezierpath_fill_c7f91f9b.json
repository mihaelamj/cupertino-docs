If the path contains any open subpaths, this method implicitly closes them before painting the fill region.\n\nThe painted region includes the pixels right up to, but not including, the path line itself. For paths with large line widths, this can result in overlap between the fill region and the stroked path (which is itself centered on the path line).\n\nThis method automatically saves the current graphics state prior to drawing and restores that state when it is done, so you do not have to save the graphics state yourself.",
