The resource identified by this URL may be local to the current app or it may be one that must be provided by a different app. UIKit supports many common schemes, including the `http`, `https`, `tel`, `facetime`, and `mailto` schemes. You can also employ custom URL schemes associated with apps installed on the device.\n- **options**: A dictionary of options to use when opening the URL. For a list of possible keys to include in this dictionary, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/OpenExternalURLOptionsKey].\n- **completion**: The block to execute with the results. Provide a value for this parameter if you want to be informed of the success or failure of opening the URL. This block is executed asynchronously on your app’s main thread. The block has no return value and takes the following parameter:\n\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nUse this method to open the specified resource.
