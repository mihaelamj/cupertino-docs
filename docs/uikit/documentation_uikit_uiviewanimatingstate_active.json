This is the initial state of the animator object.\n- **UIViewAnimatingState.stopped**: The animation is stopped. Putting an animation into this state ends the animation and leaves any animatable properties at their current values, instead of updating them to their intended final values. An animation cannot be started while in this state.\n\n",
