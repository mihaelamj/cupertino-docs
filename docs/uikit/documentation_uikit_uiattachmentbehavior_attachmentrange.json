The specified range must always contain the value 0, which represents the starting point of movement for items. Items slide along the axis between the minimum and maximum values you specify. Setting this property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFloatRange\/zero] prevents items from sliding at all along their axis of translation.\n\nFor pin attachments, this property defines the amount of rotation (measured in radians) supported in the counter-clockwise and clockwise directions. The specified range must contain the value `0`, which represents the starting angle of each item. Items rotate around the anchor point between the minimum and maximum values you specify. Setting this property to [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFloatRange\/zero] prevents items from rotating at all.\n\nThe default value of this property is [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIFloatRange\/infinite].",
