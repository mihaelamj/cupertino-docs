Similarly, you might choose a specific appearance for print-related views so that they reflect what the user sees on the printed page.\n\nThe system assumes that apps linked against the iOS 13 or later SDK support both light and dark appearances. In iOS, you specify the specific appearance you want by assigning a specific interface style to your window, view, or view controller. You can also disable support for Dark Mode entirely using an `Info.plist` key.\n\nFor general information about how to support Dark Mode, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/supporting-dark-mode-in-your-interface].\n\n### Override the interface style for a window, view, or view controller\n\nWhen your interface must always appear in a light or dark style, regardless of the system setting, set the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/overrideUserInterfaceStyle] property of the appropriate window, view, or view controller to that style. Overriding the interface style affects other objects in your interface as follows:\n\nThe following code example enables a light appearance for a view controller and all of its views.\n\n### Override the interface style for child view controllers\n\nParent view controllers control the appearance of their contained child view controllers. To override the interface style for a child view controller, use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/setOverrideTraitCollection(_:forChild:)] method to assign new traits to that view controller.

If you need extra time to work on your app’s Dark Mode support, you can temporarily opt out by including the [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/BundleResources\/Information-Property-List\/UIUserInterfaceStyle] key (with a value of `Light`) in your app’s `Info.plist` file. Setting this key to `Light` causes the system to ignore the user’s preference and always apply a light appearance to your app.",
