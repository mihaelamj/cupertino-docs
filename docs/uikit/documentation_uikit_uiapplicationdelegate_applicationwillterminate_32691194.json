However, this method may be called in situations where the app is running in the background (not suspended) and the system needs to terminate it for some reason.\n\nAfter calling this method, the app also posts a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplication\/willTerminateNotification] notification to give interested objects a chance to respond to the transition.",
