UIKit handles most window-related interactions, working with other objects as needed to implement many app behaviors.\n\nYou use windows only when you need to do the following:\n\nNormally, Xcode provides your app’s main window. New iOS projects use storyboards to define the app’s views. Storyboards require the presence of a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIApplicationDelegate\/window] property on the app delegate object, which the Xcode templates automatically provide. If your app doesn’t use storyboards, you must create this window yourself.\n\nMost apps need only one window, which displays the app’s content on the device’s main screen. Although you can create additional windows on the device’s main screen, extra windows are commonly used to display content on an external screen, as described in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/presenting-content-on-a-connected-display].\n\nYou also use [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIWindow] objects for a handful of other tasks:\n\nWindows don’t have any visual appearance of their own.
