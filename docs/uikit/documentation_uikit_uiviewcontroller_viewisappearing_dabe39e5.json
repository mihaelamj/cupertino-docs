  "overview" : "## Discussion\n\nThe system calls this method once each time a view controller’s view appears after the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillAppear(_:)] call. In contrast to `viewWillAppear(_:)`, the system calls this method after it adds the view controller’s view to the view hierarchy, and the superview lays out the view controller’s view. By the time the system calls this method, both the view controller and its view have received updated trait collections and the view has accurate geometry.\n\nYou can override this method to perform custom tasks associated with displaying the view. For example, you might use this method to configure or update views based on the trait collections of the view or view controller. Or, because computing a scroll position relies on the view’s size and geometry, you might programmatically scroll a collection or table view to ensure a selected cell is visible when the view appears.\n\nIf you override this method, you need to call `super` at some point in your implementation.\n\n### Choosing the appropriate callback\n\nAlthough the system calls this method after [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillAppear(_:)], both callbacks occur within the same [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/QuartzCore\/CATransaction]. This means that changes you make in either method become visible to the user at the same time.\n\n\n\nThe traits and geometry aren’t up to date when the system calls [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillAppear(_:)], but they are when the system calls `viewIsAppearing(_:)`, so use `viewIsAppearing(_:)` to update your views.\n\nUse `viewWillAppear(:_)` only when:\n\nFor all other cases, use `viewIsAppearing(_:)` to update your views.\n\nThe system calls layout methods, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillLayoutSubviews()] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidLayoutSubviews()], whenever the view runs [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/layoutSubviews()], which can happen multiple times during the transition, or at any time while the view is visible. However, the system calls `viewIsAppearing(_:)` only once during the appearance transition, and calls it even if the view doesn’t require laying out when it appears.\n\nFor more information about how a view controller adds views to view hierarchies, and the sequence of messages that occur, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/displaying-and-managing-views-with-a-view-controller].",

Alongside animations are animations that you direct the framework to perform concurrently with the view controller transition animations.\n- You need balanced callbacks to do something that doesn’t depend on the view controller or view traits, hierarchy, or geometry. Use cases include registering for database notifications in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillAppear(_:)] and unregistering in [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidDisappear(_:)].\n\nFor all other cases, use `viewIsAppearing(_:)` to update your views.\n\n\n\nThe system calls layout methods, such as [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewWillLayoutSubviews()] and [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIViewController\/viewDidLayoutSubviews()], whenever the view runs [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIView\/layoutSubviews()], which can happen multiple times during the transition, or at any time while the view is visible.
