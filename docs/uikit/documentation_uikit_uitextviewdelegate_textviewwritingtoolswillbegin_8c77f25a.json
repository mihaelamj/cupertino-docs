During the course of a writing tools session, the writing tools UI suggests changes to the text view’s text. It also allows the person to toggle between the original and replacement text before choosing one. To avoid issues while these changes occur, save any current data to disk and and disable features that might modify your view’s text storage while the session is active. For example, disable iCloud synchronization until the session ends. Reenable those features when the session ends.\n\nThe text view calls this method when the person requests the writing tools interface, but before the interface makes any changes to your content. Because the session isn’t active yet, the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UITextView\/isWritingToolsActive] property of the text view is [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/false] while this method executes. The value of that property resolves to [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Swift\/true] only after the method returns.",
