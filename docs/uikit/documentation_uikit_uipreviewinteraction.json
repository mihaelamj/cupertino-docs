The interaction progresses through these phases as a person applies more force with a touch. The following image shows the relationship between the force of a person’s touch and the phases of the preview interaction.\n\n\n\nWhen using view controller previewing, *peek* represents the preview phase, and *pop* the commit phase.\n\n\n\nA preview interaction is responsible for managing 3D Touch interactions for a specified view. It uses a delegate object to communicate the progress and status of the interaction to your code.\n\nTo use a preview interaction in your app:\n\n1. Create a [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPreviewInteraction] object, passing the view into the default initializer.\n2. Create a delegate object that conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPreviewInteractionDelegate] protocol, and implement the appropriate methods.\n3. Assign the delegate object to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPreviewInteraction\/delegate] property on the preview interaction object.\n\nFor more information about the state transitions through which a preview interaction progresses, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.uikit\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIPreviewInteractionDelegate].\n\n## Creating a preview interaction\n\n- **init(view:)**: Returns a newly initialized preview interaction for the specified view.\n\n## Preparing preview interactions\n\n- **delegate**: An object that acts as the delegate of the preview interaction.\n- **UIPreviewInteractionDelegate**: A set of methods for communicating the progress of a preview interaction.\n\n## Handling preview interactions\n\n- **view**: The view from which the preview interaction receives touch events.\n- **cancel()**: Cancels the current preview interaction.\n- **location(in:)**: Returns the location of the touch that started the interaction.\n\n## 3D Touch interactions\n\n- **UIPreviewInteractionDelegate**: A set of methods for communicating the progress of a preview interaction.\n- **UIPreviewActionItem**: A set of methods that defines the styles you can apply to peek quick actions and peek quick action groups, and defines a read-only accessor for the user-visible title of a peek quick action.\n\n## Inherits From\n\n- NSObject\n\n## Conforms To\n\n- CVarArg\n- CustomDebugStringConvertible\n- CustomStringConvertible\n- Equatable\n- Hashable\n- NSObjectProtocol\n- Sendable\n\n",
