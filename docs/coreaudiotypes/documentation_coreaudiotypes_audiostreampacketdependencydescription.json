If for packet #122 ``mIsIndependentlyDecodable``\nis 0, or ``mIsIndependentlyDecodable`` is 1 but ``mPreRollCount`` is 2 or more, the client would still not\nget optimal output for packet #123 if starting here, so the client continues to scan back.\nIf for packet #121 ``mIsIndependentlyDecodable`` is 1 and ``mPreRollCount`` is 2 or less, the client would\nstart decoding from this point, but discard the output equivalent of the two extra input packets\n(desired first output packet - actual first decoded packet, or 122 - 120 == 2).\n\n```\n\n## [Topics](\/documentation\/CoreAudioTypes\/AudioStreamPacketDependencyDescription#topics)\n\n### [Initializers](\/documentation\/CoreAudioTypes\/AudioStreamPacketDependencyDescription#Initializers)\n\n[`init()`](\/documentation\/coreaudiotypes\/audiostreampacketdependencydescription\/init())[`init(mIsIndependentlyDecodable: UInt32, mPreRollCount: UInt32, mFlags: UInt32, mReserved: UInt32)`](\/documentation\/coreaudiotypes\/audiostreampacketdependencydescription\/init(misindependentlydecodable:mprerollcount:mflags:mreserved:))### [Instance Properties](\/documentation\/CoreAudioTypes\/AudioStreamPacketDependencyDescription#Instance-Properties)\n\n[`var mFlags: UInt32`](\/documentation\/coreaudiotypes\/audiostreampacketdependencydescription\/mflags)[`var mIsIndependentlyDecodable: UInt32`](\/documentation\/coreaudiotypes\/audiostreampacketdependencydescription\/misindependentlydecodable)[`var mPreRollCount: UInt32`](\/documentation\/coreaudiotypes\/audiostreampacketdependencydescription\/mprerollcount)[`var mReserved: UInt32`](\/documentation\/coreaudiotypes\/audiostreampacketdependencydescription\/mreserved)## [Relationships](\/documentation\/CoreAudioTypes\/AudioStreamPacketDependencyDescription#relationships)\n\n### [Conforms To](\/documentation\/CoreAudioTypes\/AudioStreamPacketDependencyDescription#conforms-to)\n\n- [`BitwiseCopyable`](\/documentation\/Swift\/BitwiseCopyable)\n\n- [`Sendable`](\/documentation\/Swift\/Sendable)",
