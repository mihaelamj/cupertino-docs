  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nUse the External Accessory framework to set up and manage a connection to an MFi accessory your iOS app supports. The framework supports hardware that connects to an iOS or iPadOS device physically through an Apple Lightning or a 30-pin connector, or wirelessly with Bluetooth technology. The framework notifies your app when the accessory connects or disconnects from the user’s device. While connected, you communicate directly with the accessory using any hardware protocols the device supports.\n\nThe manufacturer of an MFi accessory decides which third-party apps may communicate with their accessories. If you’re developing an app, work with the manufacturer to obtain the information you need to communicate with their hardware. For example, obtain the specifications for the communication protocols the device supports.\n\nFor more information about how to connect to external accessories, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/featuredarticles\/ExternalAccessoryPT\/Introduction\/Introduction.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40009502].",
