Your text must be relatively short, so specify single words or brief sentences. If you specify a string that exceeds the model’s supported maximum string length, the system tries to extract important or interesting concepts and use those instead.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA concept object that encapsulates the specified text.\n\n## Discussion\n\nCall this method when you want to use short strings to generate an image. The system passes short strings in their entirety as input to the diffusion model.
