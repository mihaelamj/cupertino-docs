You can specify any length string you want. For strings above a minimum length, the system extracts important or interesting concepts using the contents of `title` as a guide. It converts the concepts it extracts into a separate input prompts for the diffusion model. For strings below the minimum length, the system passes the entire string to the model.\n- **title**: A concise summary of the text you pass in the `text` parameter. The system uses this string as a guide to extract concepts from the `text` parameter.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA concept object that encapsulates the concepts from the specified text.\n\n## Discussion\n\nCall this method when you want to use long-form text to generate an image. The method extracts relevant details from the text and uses them to create the returned object.\n\n## Describing the image\n\n- **text(_:)**: Creates a concept structure that includes a short text description.\n- **drawing(_:)**: Creates a concept structure from a PencilKit drawing.\n- **image(_:)**: Creates a concept structure from the specified image object.\n- **image(_:)**: Creates a concept structure from the image at the specified URL.\n\n",
