For devices with a nonzero advance schedule time, drivers receive outgoing messages to the device at the time the client sends them using [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremidi\/documentation\/CoreMIDI\/MIDISend(_:_:_:)]. The driver is responsible for scheduling events to play at the right times, according to their timestamps.\n\nYou can also set this property on any virtual destinations you create. When clients send messages to a virtual destination with an advance schedule time of 0, the destination receives the messages at the scheduled delivery time. If a virtual destination has a nonzero advance schedule time, it receives timestamped messages as soon as they’re sent, and must do its own internal scheduling of events it receives.",
