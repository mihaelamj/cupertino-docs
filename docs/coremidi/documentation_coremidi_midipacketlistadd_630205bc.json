May be a single MIDI event, or a partial sys-ex event. Running status is *not* permitted.\n\n## Return Value\n\nReturns null if there was not room in the packet for the event; otherwise returns a packet pointer which should be passed as curPacket in a subsequent call to this function.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe maximum size of a packet list is 65536 bytes. Large sysex messages must be sent in smaller packet lists.\n\n## Deprecated Functions\n\n- **MIDIInputPortCreate(_:_:_:_:_:)**: Creates an input port through which the client may receive incoming MIDI messages from any MIDI source.\n- **MIDIInputPortCreateWithBlock(_:_:_:_:)**: Creates an input port through which the client may receive incoming MIDI messages from any MIDI source.\n- **MIDISourceCreate(_:_:_:)**: Creates a virtual source in a client.\n- **MIDIDestinationCreate(_:_:_:_:_:)**: Creates a virtual destination in a client.\n- **MIDIDestinationCreateWithBlock(_:_:_:_:)**: Creates a virtual destination in a client.\n- **MIDIPacketListInit(_:)**: Prepares a MIDIPacketList to be built up dynamically.\n- **MIDISend(_:_:_:)**: Sends MIDI to a destination.\n- **MIDIReceived(_:_:)**: Distributes incoming MIDI from a source to the client input ports which are connected to that source.\n- **MIDIReadProc**: A function receiving MIDI input.\n- **MIDIReadBlock**: A block receiving MIDI input.\n\n",
