(Although you should be prepared for this to fail in the unlikely event of a collision.) This will permit other clients to retain persistent references to your virtual destination more easily.\n\nSee the discussion of kMIDIPropertyAdvanceScheduleTimeMuSec for notes about the relationship between when a sender sends MIDI to the destination and when it is received.",
