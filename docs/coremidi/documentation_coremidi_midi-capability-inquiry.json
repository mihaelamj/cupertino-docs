MIDI-CI discovers and configures devices using the following means:\n\n- Profile configuration. Profiles define a standard set of rules for how devices respond to MIDI messages. For example, devices that support a piano profile respond to messages common to a piano, such as note on and off, velocity, and pedaling.\n- Property exchange. Devices can use a set of System Exclusive (SysEx) messages to find and control various properties of other devices.\n- Protocol negotiation. MIDI 2.0 devices can select between using the MIDI 1.0 or 2.0 protocols, falling back to 1.0 when not supported by other devices.\n\nMIDI-CI defines two roles in the communication between devices: *initiator* and *responder*. Client processes acting as the initiator use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremidi\/documentation\/CoreMIDI\/MIDICISession] API, which allows for profile and property configuration of the associated responder. Client processes that advertise their own profile and property capabilities use the [doc:\/\/com.apple.coremidi\/documentation\/CoreMIDI\/MIDICIResponder] API, which sends responder-originated messages to initiators.\n\n## Capability Inquiry\n\n- **MIDICIDiscoveryManager**: A singleton object that performs systemwide MIDI-CI discovery.\n- **MIDICISession**: An object that represents a MIDI-CI session.\n- **MIDICIProfile**: A mapping of MIDI messages to specific sounds and synthesis behaviors, such as General MIDI, a drawbar organ, and so on.\n- **MIDICIProfileState**: An object that provides the enabled and disabled profiles for a MIDI channel or port on a device.\n- **MIDICIResponder**: An object that responds to MIDI-CI inquiries from an initiator on behalf of a MIDI client, and handles profile and property exchange operations.\n\n## Services\n\n- **MIDI Services**: Communicate with hardware using Universal MIDI Packets.\n- **MIDI System Setup**: Configure the global MIDI system.\n- **MIDI Bluetooth**: Connect to Bluetooth Low Energy MIDI peripherals.\n- **MIDI Messages**: Create and configure messages.\n- **MIDI Thru Connection**: Create play-through connections between sources and destinations.\n- **MIDI Networking**: Create and manage devices connected over a local network.\n- **MIDI Drivers**: Create driver plug-ins.\n\n",
