To specify which apps your sticker pack is available in, update your `Info.plist` file. Add the `NSStickerSharingLevel` key inside your Messages extension’s `Info.plist` file. The value for this key is the string `{OS}`. Messages checks for the presence of the `Info.plist` key when your app launches outside of Messages. If you add this key to your app, your sticker pack doesn’t appear in the list.",
