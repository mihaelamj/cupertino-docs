If this parameter is empty, the application extension only receives callbacks for the start and end times of the schedule’s interval. If the device’s time zone changes in the middle of a schedule’s interval, any ongoing events include device activity that may have accumulated outside of the new time zone. In other words, the system uses the time zone of the device at `nextInterval.start` to calculate device activity for the entirety of the interval.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIf the app already monitored the activity, this method overwrites the previous schedule and events. Attempting to monitor too many activities or activities that are too tightly scheduled can cause this method to throw an error.\n\nThe system throws an error if the attempt to monitor the device activity failed. To avoid errors, reduce the number of unique, tightly-scheduled activities. For example, consider using the `warningTime` property of an activity’s schedule.\n\n\n\n## Monitoring Device Activities\n\n- **init()**: Creates an activity center to manage which device activities your application monitors.\n- **stopMonitoring(_:)**: Stops monitoring the specified device activities.\n- **activities**: The activities that the application’s extension currently monitors.\n\n",
