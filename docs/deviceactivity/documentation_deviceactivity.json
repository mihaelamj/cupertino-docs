For instance, you can set up a bedtime schedule that monitors device activity while the user is supposed to be asleep. Your app extension can receive warnings before an activity’s schedule starts or ends, or when an activity is about to reach a predefined threshold. You can monitor the time spent on websites and apps to warn the user once they have reached their threshold.\n\n",
