For example, if you detect a characteristic type of [doc:\/\/com.apple.homekit\/documentation\/HomeKit\/HMCharacteristicTypeCurrentTemperature], then you know that the corresponding [doc:\/\/com.apple.homekit\/documentation\/HomeKit\/HMCharacteristic\/value] is a measure of the current temperature.\n\nFrom the type, you can typically infer the value’s format. The value for the current temperature is always a floating point number measured in degrees Celsius, as shown in the code snippet above. You can also use the characteristic’s [doc:\/\/com.apple.homekit\/documentation\/HomeKit\/HMCharacteristic\/metadata] to get explicit and detailed guidance on how to format the value.\n\nSee [doc:\/\/com.apple.homekit\/documentation\/HomeKit\/characteristic-types] for a list of standard types.",
