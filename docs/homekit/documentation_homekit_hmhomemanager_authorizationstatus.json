You don’t make an explicit request for access, but you can modify the behavior of your app based on the current authorization status. For example, if your app lacks access to home data, you might omit certain features from your UI.\n\nThe [doc:\/\/com.apple.homekit\/documentation\/HomeKit\/HMHomeManager\/authorizationStatus] property contains a bit field that indicates the current authorization status. Your app has home data authorization only when the [doc:\/\/com.apple.homekit\/documentation\/HomeKit\/HMHomeManagerAuthorizationStatus\/authorized] bit is present:\n\nUsers can revoke permission at any time in the Settings app, so your app should always be prepared to handle errors caused by lack of access.\n\nFor more information about gaining authorization to access home data, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.homekit\/documentation\/HomeKit\/enabling-homekit-in-your-app].",
