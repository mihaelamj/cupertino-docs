Areas of the object that are parallel with a coordinate axis cause the node to fully show the respective image. Areas of the object between the coordinate axis cause the node to render a mix of the images based on how close the normal is to each of the axis. The closer the normal is to the normal of a coordinate axis the strong the respective image is in the blend. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the `Triplanar Projection` node to blend the same grass image in the X and Y directions, and a tile texture in the Z direction:\n\n\n\nBelow, the resulting texture applies to a sphere:\n\n",
