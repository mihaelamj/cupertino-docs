  "overview" : "## Overview\n\nCreate complex materials and effects with Shader Graph, a node-based material editor within Reality Composer Pro. The editor presents an interface in which you can build out node graphs to achieve various visual effects.\n\nWith the control Shader Graph provides over materials, you can create effects that might otherwise require writing Metal shaders. The nodes represent either a value or operation, and have inputs and outputs you can connect to build a material. They serve the same purpose as a variable, constant, or function in Metal. Multiple versions of a node tweak the inputs and outputs it can receive, similar to overloads of a function.\n\n\n\nBuild your material using the nodes that achieve your desired visual and geometric effects, and apply these materials to entities within your Reality Composer Pro scene.\n\n## Interoperability\n\nShader Graph uses MaterialX 1.38 conventions to improve interoperability with content creation applications that can read and author MaterialX within USD files.\n\nShader Graph also includes several nodes that are unique to RealityKit. Some of these nodes are available as standard MaterialX definitions that you can use within your content creation workflow. To download these definitions, see [https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/augmented-reality\/realitykit\/files\/MaterialX-definitions.zip].",
