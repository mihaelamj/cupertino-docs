Each character in the `Channel` string represents one of the channels of the `In` parameter.

The order of the characters determines how the channels of the input switch around to create the output. For the previous example, if the `Channels` parameter is “zzz”, the output is `(10, 10, 10)`.\n\nThe table below shows additional examples of the swizzle node process:",
