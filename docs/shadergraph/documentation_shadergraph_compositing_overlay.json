Visually the node makes dark areas of the blended texture even darker and light areas of the blended texture even lighter.\n\nBelow is an example of a simple node graph that uses the `Overlay` node to blend two images together into a single material:\n\n\n\nBelow are two images and their resulting blended texture applied to a cube:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Nodes\n\n- **Premultiply**: Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.\n- **Unpremultiply**: Divides the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.\n- **Additive Mix**: Adds foreground and background values.\n- **Subtractive Mix**: Subtracts foreground from background values.\n- **Difference**: Outputs the distance between foreground and background values.\n- **Burn**: A blend operation that darkens the foreground layer using the background.\n- **Dodge**: A blend operation that lightens the background layer depending on the foreground.\n- **Screen**: A blend operation that lightens areas that are darker than white.\n- **Disjoint Over**: A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.\n- **In**: Outputs areas of foreground that overlap with the alpha of background.\n- **Mask**: Outputs areas of background that overlap with the alpha of foreground.\n- **Matte**: A merge operation that layers premultiplied foreground over background.\n- **Out**: Outputs areas of foreground that do not overlap with background.\n- **Over**: A merge operation that layers foreground over background, using the alpha of the foreground.\n- **Inside**: Multiplies a mask to all channels of the input.\n\n",
