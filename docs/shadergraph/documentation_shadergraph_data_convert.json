The supported type conversions are shown above with the various convert node types. The `Convert` node handles data types in the following ways:\n\n- When converting a `float` to a `color` or `vector`, the `Convert` node copies the `float` to all channels of the `color` or `vector`.\n- When converting a `color3` to a `color4`, the `Convert` node sets the output alpha to `1.0`\n- When converting a `color4` to a `color3`, the `Convert` node drops the alpha channel.\n- When converting a `boolean` or `integer` to a `float`, the output is either `1.0` or `0.0`.\n- When converting a `vector2` to `vector3` or a `vector3` to a `vector4`, the `Convert` nodes populates the additional channel with a value of `1.0`\n- When converting a `vector4` to a `vector3`, or a `vector3` to a `vector2`, drop the last channel.\n\n## Nodes\n\n- **Swizzle**: Performs an arbitrary permutation of the channels of the input stream, returning a new stream of the specified type.\n- **Combine 2**: Combines the channels from two streams into two channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.\n- **Combine 3**: Combines the channels from three streams into three channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.\n- **Combine 4**: Combines the channels from four streams into four channels of a single output stream of a compatible type.\n- **Extract**: Generates a float stream from one channel of a color​N o​r vector​N ​stream.\n- **Separate 2**: Outputs each of the channels of a vector2 or integer2 as individual float or integer outputs.\n- **Separate 3**: Outputs each of the channels of a color3, vector3, or integer3 as individual float or integer outputs.\n- **Separate 4**: Outputs each of the channels of a color4, vector4, or integer4 as individual float or integer outputs.\n- **Primvar Reader**: A node that provides the ability for shading networks to consume data defined on geometry.\n\n",
