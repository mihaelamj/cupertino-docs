All noise values that are procedurally generated are numbers between `0` and `1` before the amplitude and pivot are applied. Because this node generates noise in 3D, the texture doesn’t repeat in the Z direction, but rather continues as depth changes. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the Noise 3D node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally:\n\n\n\nMultiply the incoming position with a constant float. The float changes the frequency of the generated noise to a higher number that corresponds with the pattern repeating more often. Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube:\n\n",
