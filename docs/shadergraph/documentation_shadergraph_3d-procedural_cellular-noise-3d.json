Because this node generates noise in 3D, the texture doesn’t repeat in the Z direction, but rather continue as depth changes. Below is an example of a node graph that uses the `Cellular Noise 3D` node to generate a black and white pattern procedurally:\n\n\n\nMultiply the incoming position with a constant float. The float changes the frequency of the generated noise to a higher number that corresponds with the pattern repeating more often. The output of the node runs through a `Convert` node to change the float output to a black and white color output. Below, the resulting texture applies to a cube:\n\n",
