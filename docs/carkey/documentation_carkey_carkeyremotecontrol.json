The system retrieves the relevant vehicle information from person’s Apple Wallet and adds vehicles that match your company’s make to the session.\n\nStart a new session only when your app is running in the foreground. If your app enters the background, end the current session and start a new one when your app returns to the foreground.",

Under certain conditions the system will not relaunch the app regardless of CarKey events.\n- **unregisterForLaunchOnCarKeyEvent()**: Unregister your app so it’s no longer relaunched in the background on CarKey events.\n\n## Setup\n\n- **CarKeyRemoteControlSession**: The object that manages communication with the vehicles you manufacture.\n- **CarKeyRemoteControlSessionDelegate**: An interface you use to receive session- and vehicle-related information from the system.\n- **VehicleReport**: A type that contains information about a vehicle configured for remote keyless entry in the user’s Apple Wallet.\n\n",
