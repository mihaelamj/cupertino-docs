The system generates a vehicle report for each vehicle that matches your company’s make, and that the owner configured in their Apple Wallet. Use a vehicle report to get information about the vehicle, such as whether it’s currently connected and able to receive commands. You can also use the report to determine which vehicle features you can operate from your app.\n\nA vehicle can optionally attach proprietary data to one of its function identifiers. You might use this data to support additional features related to that vehicle feature. For example, you might want to attach a unique security code to the door lock function. Use the vehicle report to retrieve any data your vehicle sends. If the vehicle sends new data, the system updates the report and notifies your session delegate.",
