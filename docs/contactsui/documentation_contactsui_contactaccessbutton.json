They choose this subset of contacts the first time your app requests access with [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/Contacts\/CNContactStore\/requestAccess(for:completionHandler:)], and can update them in the Settings app. You use this button to prompt them to authorize additional contacts for your app to use while operating under limited-access authorization.\n\nUse this button in addition to a search UI in your app, such as a text field. Initialize the button with a query string from your search UI, along with email addresses and phone numbers to ignore. If a single contact matches, the button shows that contact’s name and image, and tapping the button grants your app access to that contact. If multiple contacts match, tapping the button navigates to another view where the person can choose which contacts to allow. The button updates its display as the query string changes; using a query string bound to a SwiftUI [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/TextField] allows the button to update its display of matches in real time as the person types.\n\nTo show a picker of all contacts and allow someone to add them to your app, without presenting your own search UI, use [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/SwiftUI\/View\/contactAccessPicker(isPresented:completionHandler:)].",
