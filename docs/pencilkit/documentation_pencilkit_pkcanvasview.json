The canvas stores the captured input in a [doc:\/\/com.apple.pencilkit\/documentation\/PencilKit\/PKDrawingReference] object.\n\n[doc:\/\/com.apple.pencilkit\/documentation\/PencilKit\/PKCanvasView] is a scroll view, so you can make the drawable area bigger than the canvas view’s frame rectangle. To do that, set the inherited [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/UIScrollView\/contentSize] property to the size you want. The canvas view automatically scales its underlying content to match the size you specify. Users scroll around the canvas using a two-finger pan gesture. (If the [doc:\/\/com.apple.pencilkit\/documentation\/PencilKit\/PKCanvasView\/allowsFingerDrawing] property is `false`, users scroll with only one finger.)\n\nA canvas view conforms to the [doc:\/\/com.apple.pencilkit\/documentation\/PencilKit\/PKToolPickerObserver] protocol, so you can add it as an observer of the window’s tool picker. The tool picker displays a floating palette of tools that the user can choose from. As the user interacts with items in the palette, such as changing ink colors, or line widths, the canvas automatically updates its drawing environment accordingly.",
