PencilKit provides a drawing environment for your iOS app that receives input from Apple Pencil or the user’s finger, and turns it into images you display in iPadOS, iOS, or macOS. The environment comes with tools for creating, erasing, and selecting lines.\n\nYou capture content in your iPad app using a [doc:\/\/com.apple.pencilkit\/documentation\/PencilKit\/PKCanvasView] object that you integrate into your existing view hierarchy. It supports the low-latency capture of touches originating from Apple Pencil or your finger. The canvas object sends final results as a [doc:\/\/com.apple.pencilkit\/documentation\/PencilKit\/PKDrawing-swift.struct] object, whose contents you can save with your app’s content. You can also convert the drawn content into an image for display in iOS or macOS app.\n\nFor information about handling user interactions on Apple Pencil in your UIKit app, see [doc:\/\/com.apple.documentation\/documentation\/UIKit\/apple-pencil-interactions].",
