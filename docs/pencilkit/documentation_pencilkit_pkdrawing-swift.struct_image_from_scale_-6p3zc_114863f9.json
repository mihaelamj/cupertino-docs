Specify a rectangle in the canvas’ coordinate system.\n- **scale**: The scale factor at which to create the image. Specifying scale factors greater than `1.0` creates an image with more detail. For example, you might specify a scale factor of `2.0` or `3.0` when displaying the image on a Retina display.\n\n## Return Value\n\nA new image object that contains the rendered content.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis method creates a new image and renders content from the canvas into that image at the specified scale factor.\n\n## Generating an image\n\n- **image(from:scale:)**: Returns an image object that contains the specified portion of the drawing.\n\n",
