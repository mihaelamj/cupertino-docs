        # Text
This chapter previously described the basic text support provided by Quartz. However, the low-level support provided by Quartz has been deprecated and superceded by Core Text, an advanced low-level technology for laying out text and handing fonts. Core Text is designed for high performance and ease of use and allows you to draw Unicode text directly to a graphics context. If you are writing an application that needs precise control over how text is displayed, see *[Core Text Programming Guide](../../../../StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/CoreText_Programming/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005533)*.

If you are developing a text application for iOS, look first at *[Text Programming Guide for iOS](../../../../StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009542)*, which describes text support in iOS. In particular, UIKit provides classes that implement common tasks, making it easy to add text to your application:

If you are developing a text application for Mac OS X, look first at *[Cocoa Text Architecture Guide](../../../../TextFonts/Conceptual/CocoaTextArchitecture/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009459)*, which describes the Cocoa text system. Cocoa provides full Unicode support, text input and editing, precise text layout and typesetting, font management, and many other advanced text-handling capabilities.
