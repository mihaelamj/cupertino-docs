In Swift, this can be done in a single line:\n\n\n\n```\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n\/\/ Prints \"Hello, world!\"\n\n```\n\nThis syntax should look familiar if you know another language — in Swift, this line of code is a complete program. You don’t need to import a separate library for functionality like outputting text or handling strings. Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you don’t need a `main()` function. You also don’t need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.\n\nThis tour gives you enough information to start writing code in Swift by showing you how to accomplish a variety of programming tasks. Don’t worry if you don’t understand something — everything introduced in this tour is explained in detail in the rest of this book.\n\n## [Simple Values](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Simple-Values)\n\nUse `let` to make a constant and `var` to make a variable. The value of a constant doesn’t need to be known at compile time, but you must assign it a value exactly once. This means you can use constants to name a value that you determine once but use in many places.\n\n\n\n```\nvar myVariable = 42\nmyVariable = 50\nlet myConstant = 42\n\n```\n\nA constant or variable must have the same type as the value you want to assign to it. However, you don’t always have to write the type explicitly. Providing a value when you create a constant or variable lets the compiler infer its type. In the example above, the compiler infers that `myVariable` is an integer because its initial value is an integer.\n\nIf the initial value doesn’t provide enough information (or if there isn’t an initial value), specify the type by writing it after the variable, separated by a colon.\n\n\n\n```\nlet implicitInteger = 70\nlet implicitDouble = 70.0\nlet explicitDouble: Double = 70\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nCreate a constant with an explicit type of `Float` and a value of `4`.\n\nValues are never implicitly converted to another type. If you need to convert a value to a different type, explicitly make an instance of the desired type.\n\n\n\n```\nlet label = \"The width is \"\nlet width = 94\nlet widthLabel = label + String(width)\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nTry removing the conversion to `String` from the last line. What error do you get?\n\nThere’s an even simpler way to include values in strings: Write the value in parentheses, and write a backslash (`\\`) before the parentheses. For example:\n\n\n\n```\nlet apples = 3\nlet oranges = 5\nlet appleSummary = \"I have (apples) apples.\"\nlet fruitSummary = \"I have (apples + oranges) pieces of fruit.\"\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nUse `\\()` to include a floating-point calculation in a string and to include someone’s name in a greeting.\n\nUse three double quotation marks (`\"\"\"`) for strings that take up multiple lines. Indentation at the start of each quoted line is removed, as long as it matches the indentation of the closing quotation marks. For example:\n\n\n\n```\nlet quotation = \"\"\"\n        Even though there's whitespace to the left,\n        the actual lines aren't indented.\n            Except for this line.\n        Double quotes (\") can appear without being escaped.\n\n        I still have (apples + oranges) pieces of fruit.\n        \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nCreate arrays and dictionaries using brackets (`[]`), and access their elements by writing the index or key in brackets. A comma is allowed after the last element.\n\n\n\n```\nvar fruits = [\"strawberries\", \"limes\", \"tangerines\"]\nfruits[1] = \"grapes\"\n\n\nvar occupations = [\n    \"Malcolm\": \"Captain\",\n    \"Kaylee\": \"Mechanic\",\n ]\noccupations[\"Jayne\"] = \"Public Relations\"\n\n```\n\nArrays automatically grow as you add elements.\n\n\n\n```\nfruits.append(\"blueberries\")\nprint(fruits)\n\/\/ Prints \"[\"strawberries\", \"grapes\", \"tangerines\", \"blueberries\"]\".\n\n```\n\nYou also use brackets to write an empty array or dictionary. For an array, write `[]`, and for a dictionary, write `[:]`.\n\n\n\n```\nfruits = []\noccupations = [:]\n\n```\n\nIf you’re assigning an empty array or dictionary to a new variable, or another place where there isn’t any type information, you need to specify the type.\n\n\n\n```\nlet emptyArray: [String] = []\nlet emptyDictionary: [String: Float] = [:]\n\n```\n\n## [Control Flow](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Control-Flow)\n\nUse `if` and `switch` to make conditionals, and use `for`-`in`, `while`, and `repeat`-`while` to make loops. Parentheses around the condition or loop variable are optional. Braces around the body are required.\n\n\n\n```\nlet individualScores = [75, 43, 103, 87, 12]\nvar teamScore = 0\nfor score in individualScores {\n    if score > 50 {\n        teamScore += 3\n    } else {\n        teamScore += 1\n    }\n}\nprint(teamScore)\n\/\/ Prints \"11\".\n\n```\n\nIn an `if` statement, the conditional must be a Boolean expression — this means that code such as `if score { ... }` is an error, not an implicit comparison to zero.\n\nYou can write `if` or `switch` after the equal sign (`=`) of an assignment or after `return`, to choose a value based on the condition.\n\n\n\n```\nlet scoreDecoration = if teamScore > 10 {\n    \"🎉\"\n} else {\n    \"\"\n}\nprint(\"Score:\", teamScore, scoreDecoration)\n\/\/ Prints \"Score: 11 🎉\".\n\n```\n\nYou can use `if` and `let` together to work with values that might be missing. These values are represented as optionals. An optional value either contains a value or contains `nil` to indicate that a value is missing. Write a question mark (`?`) after the type of a value to mark the value as optional.\n\n\n\n```\nvar optionalString: String? = \"Hello\"\nprint(optionalString == nil)\n\/\/ Prints \"false\".\n\n\nvar optionalName: String? = \"John Appleseed\"\nvar greeting = \"Hello!\"\nif let name = optionalName {\n    greeting = \"Hello, (name)\"\n}\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nChange `optionalName` to `nil`. What greeting do you get? Add an `else` clause that sets a different greeting if `optionalName` is `nil`.\n\nIf the optional value is `nil`, the conditional is `false` and the code in braces is skipped. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped and assigned to the constant after `let`, which makes the unwrapped value available inside the block of code.\n\nAnother way to handle optional values is to provide a default value using the `??` operator. If the optional value is missing, the default value is used instead.\n\n\n\n```\nlet nickname: String? = nil\nlet fullName: String = \"John Appleseed\"\nlet informalGreeting = \"Hi (nickname ?? fullName)\"\n\n```\n\nYou can use a shorter spelling to unwrap a value, using the same name for that unwrapped value.\n\n\n\n```\nif let nickname {\n    print(\"Hey, (nickname)\")\n}\n\/\/ Doesn't print anything, because nickname is nil.\n\n```\n\nSwitches support any kind of data and a wide variety of comparison operations — they aren’t limited to integers and tests for equality.\n\n\n\n```\nlet vegetable = \"red pepper\"\nswitch vegetable {\ncase \"celery\":\n    print(\"Add some raisins and make ants on a log.\")\ncase \"cucumber\", \"watercress\":\n    print(\"That would make a good tea sandwich.\")\ncase let x where x.hasSuffix(\"pepper\"):\n    print(\"Is it a spicy (x)?\")\ndefault:\n    print(\"Everything tastes good in soup.\")\n}\n\/\/ Prints \"Is it a spicy red pepper?\"\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nTry removing the default case. What error do you get?\n\nNotice how `let` can be used in a pattern to assign the value that matched the pattern to a constant.\n\nAfter executing the code inside the switch case that matched, the program exits from the switch statement. Execution doesn’t continue to the next case, so you don’t need to explicitly break out of the switch at the end of each case’s code.\n\nYou use `for`-`in` to iterate over items in a dictionary by providing a pair of names to use for each key-value pair. Dictionaries are an unordered collection, so their keys and values are iterated over in an arbitrary order.\n\n\n\n```\nlet interestingNumbers = [\n    \"Prime\": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13],\n    \"Fibonacci\": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8],\n    \"Square\": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25],\n]\nvar largest = 0\nfor (_, numbers) in interestingNumbers {\n    for number in numbers {\n        if number > largest {\n            largest = number\n        }\n    }\n}\nprint(largest)\n\/\/ Prints \"25\".\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nReplace the `_` with a variable name, and keep track of which kind of number was the largest.\n\nUse `while` to repeat a block of code until a condition changes. The condition of a loop can be at the end instead, ensuring that the loop is run at least once.\n\n\n\n```\nvar n = 2\nwhile n < 100 {\n    n *= 2\n}\nprint(n)\n\/\/ Prints \"128\".\n\n\nvar m = 2\nrepeat {\n    m *= 2\n} while m < 100\nprint(m)\n\/\/ Prints \"128\".\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\n Change the condition from `m < 100` to `m < 0` to see how `while` and `repeat`-`while` behave differently when the loop condition is already false.\n\nYou can keep an index in a loop by using `..<` to make a range of indexes.\n\n\n\n```\nvar total = 0\nfor i in 0..<4 {\n    total += i\n}\nprint(total)\n\/\/ Prints \"6\".\n\n```\n\nUse `..<` to make a range that omits its upper value, and use `...` to make a range that includes both values.\n\n## [Functions and Closures](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Functions-and-Closures)\n\nUse `func` to declare a function. Call a function by following its name with a list of arguments in parentheses. Use `->` to separate the parameter names and types from the function’s return type.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc greet(person: String, day: String) -> String {\n    return \"Hello (person), today is (day).\"\n}\ngreet(person: \"Bob\", day: \"Tuesday\")\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nRemove the `day` parameter. Add a parameter to include today’s lunch special in the greeting.\n\nBy default, functions use their parameter names as labels for their arguments. Write a custom argument label before the parameter name, or write `_` to use no argument label.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc greet(_ person: String, on day: String) -> String {\n    return \"Hello (person), today is (day).\"\n}\ngreet(\"John\", on: \"Wednesday\")\n\n```\n\nUse a tuple to make a compound value — for example, to return multiple values from a function. The elements of a tuple can be referred to either by name or by number.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc calculateStatistics(scores: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int, sum: Int) {\n    var min = scores[0]\n    var max = scores[0]\n    var sum = 0\n\n\n    for score in scores {\n        if score > max {\n            max = score\n        } else if score < min {\n            min = score\n        }\n        sum += score\n    }\n\n\n    return (min, max, sum)\n}\nlet statistics = calculateStatistics(scores: [5, 3, 100, 3, 9])\nprint(statistics.sum)\n\/\/ Prints \"120\".\nprint(statistics.2)\n\/\/ Prints \"120\".\n\n```\n\nFunctions can be nested. Nested functions have access to variables that were declared in the outer function. You can use nested functions to organize the code in a function that’s long or complex.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc returnFifteen() -> Int {\n    var y = 10\n    func add() {\n        y += 5\n    }\n    add()\n    return y\n}\nreturnFifteen()\n\n```\n\nFunctions are a first-class type. This means that a function can return another function as its value.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc makeIncrementer() -> ((Int) -> Int) {\n    func addOne(number: Int) -> Int {\n        return 1 + number\n    }\n    return addOne\n}\nvar increment = makeIncrementer()\nincrement(7)\n\n```\n\nA function can take another function as one of its arguments.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc hasAnyMatches(list: [Int], condition: (Int) -> Bool) -> Bool {\n    for item in list {\n        if condition(item) {\n            return true\n        }\n    }\n    return false\n}\nfunc lessThanTen(number: Int) -> Bool {\n    return number < 10\n}\nvar numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]\nhasAnyMatches(list: numbers, condition: lessThanTen)\n\n```\n\nFunctions are actually a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later. The code in a closure has access to things like variables and functions that were available in the scope where the closure was created, even if the closure is in a different scope when it’s executed — you saw an example of this already with nested functions. You can write a closure without a name by surrounding code with braces (`{}`). Use `in` to separate the arguments and return type from the body.\n\n\n\n```\nnumbers.map({ (number: Int) -> Int in\n    let result = 3 * number\n    return result\n})\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nRewrite the closure to return zero for all odd numbers.\n\nYou have several options for writing closures more concisely. When a closure’s type is already known, such as the callback for a delegate, you can omit the type of its parameters, its return type, or both. Single statement closures implicitly return the value of their only statement.\n\n\n\n```\nlet mappedNumbers = numbers.map({ number in 3 * number })\nprint(mappedNumbers)\n\/\/ Prints \"[60, 57, 21, 36]\".\n\n```\n\nYou can refer to parameters by number instead of by name — this approach is especially useful in very short closures. A closure passed as the last argument to a function can appear immediately after the parentheses. When a closure is the only argument to a function, you can omit the parentheses entirely.\n\n\n\n```\nlet sortedNumbers = numbers.sorted { ___CODEBLOCK_32___ >  }\nprint(sortedNumbers)\n\/\/ Prints \"[20, 19, 12, 7]\".\n\n```\n\n## [Objects and Classes](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Objects-and-Classes)\n\nUse `class` followed by the class’s name to create a class. A property declaration in a class is written the same way as a constant or variable declaration, except that it’s in the context of a class. Likewise, method and function declarations are written the same way.\n\n\n\n```\nclass Shape {\n    var numberOfSides = 0\n    func simpleDescription() -> String {\n        return \"A shape with (numberOfSides) sides.\"\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nAdd a constant property with `let`, and add another method that takes an argument.\n\nCreate an instance of a class by putting parentheses after the class name. Use dot syntax to access the properties and methods of the instance.\n\n\n\n```\nvar shape = Shape()\nshape.numberOfSides = 7\nvar shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription()\n\n```\n\nThis version of the `Shape` class is missing something important: an initializer to set up the class when an instance is created. Use `init` to create one.\n\n\n\n```\nclass NamedShape {\n    var numberOfSides: Int = 0\n    var name: String\n\n\n    init(name: String) {\n       self.name = name\n    }\n\n\n    func simpleDescription() -> String {\n       return \"A shape with (numberOfSides) sides.\"\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nNotice how `self` is used to distinguish the `name` property from the `name` argument to the initializer. The arguments to the initializer are passed like a function call when you create an instance of the class. Every property needs a value assigned — either in its declaration (as with `numberOfSides`) or in the initializer (as with `name`).\n\nUse `deinit` to create a deinitializer if you need to perform some cleanup before the object is deallocated.\n\nSubclasses include their superclass name after their class name, separated by a colon. There’s no requirement for classes to subclass any standard root class, so you can include or omit a superclass as needed.\n\nMethods on a subclass that override the superclass’s implementation are marked with `override` — overriding a method by accident, without `override`, is detected by the compiler as an error. The compiler also detects methods with `override` that don’t actually override any method in the superclass.\n\n\n\n```\nclass Square: NamedShape {\n    var sideLength: Double\n\n\n    init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {\n        self.sideLength = sideLength\n        super.init(name: name)\n        numberOfSides = 4\n    }\n\n\n    func area() -> Double {\n        return sideLength * sideLength\n    }\n\n\n    override func simpleDescription() -> String {\n        return \"A square with sides of length (sideLength).\"\n    }\n}\nlet test = Square(sideLength: 5.2, name: \"my test square\")\ntest.area()\ntest.simpleDescription()\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nMake another subclass of `NamedShape` called `Circle` that takes a radius and a name as arguments to its initializer. Implement an `area()` and a `simpleDescription()` method on the `Circle` class.\n\nIn addition to simple properties that are stored, properties can have a getter and a setter.\n\n\n\n```\nclass EquilateralTriangle: NamedShape {\n    var sideLength: Double = 0.0\n\n\n    init(sideLength: Double, name: String) {\n        self.sideLength = sideLength\n        super.init(name: name)\n        numberOfSides = 3\n    }\n\n\n    var perimeter: Double {\n        get {\n             return 3.0 * sideLength\n        }\n        set {\n            sideLength = newValue \/ 3.0\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    override func simpleDescription() -> String {\n        return \"An equilateral triangle with sides of length (sideLength).\"\n    }\n}\nvar triangle = EquilateralTriangle(sideLength: 3.1, name: \"a triangle\")\nprint(triangle.perimeter)\n\/\/ Prints \"9.3\".\ntriangle.perimeter = 9.9\nprint(triangle.sideLength)\n\/\/ Prints \"3.3000000000000003\".\n\n```\n\nIn the setter for `perimeter`, the new value has the implicit name `newValue`. You can provide an explicit name in parentheses after `set`.\n\nNotice that the initializer for the `EquilateralTriangle` class has three different steps:\n\n- Setting the value of properties that the subclass declares.\n\n- Calling the superclass’s initializer.\n\n- Changing the value of properties defined by the superclass. Any additional setup work that uses methods, getters, or setters can also be done at this point.\n\nIf you don’t need to compute the property but still need to provide code that’s run before and after setting a new value, use `willSet` and `didSet`. The code you provide is run any time the value changes outside of an initializer. For example, the class below ensures that the side length of its triangle is always the same as the side length of its square.\n\n\n\n```\nclass TriangleAndSquare {\n    var triangle: EquilateralTriangle {\n        willSet {\n            square.sideLength = newValue.sideLength\n        }\n    }\n    var square: Square {\n        willSet {\n            triangle.sideLength = newValue.sideLength\n        }\n    }\n    init(size: Double, name: String) {\n        square = Square(sideLength: size, name: name)\n        triangle = EquilateralTriangle(sideLength: size, name: name)\n    }\n}\nvar triangleAndSquare = TriangleAndSquare(size: 10, name: \"another test shape\")\nprint(triangleAndSquare.square.sideLength)\n\/\/ Prints \"10.0\".\nprint(triangleAndSquare.triangle.sideLength)\n\/\/ Prints \"10.0\".\ntriangleAndSquare.square = Square(sideLength: 50, name: \"larger square\")\nprint(triangleAndSquare.triangle.sideLength)\n\/\/ Prints \"50.0\".\n\n```\n\nWhen working with optional values, you can write `?` before operations like methods, properties, and subscripting. If the value before the `?` is `nil`, everything after the `?` is ignored and the value of the whole expression is `nil`. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped, and everything after the `?` acts on the unwrapped value. In both cases, the value of the whole expression is an optional value.\n\n\n\n```\nlet optionalSquare: Square? = Square(sideLength: 2.5, name: \"optional square\")\nlet sideLength = optionalSquare?.sideLength\n\n```\n\n## [Enumerations and Structures](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Enumerations-and-Structures)\n\nUse `enum` to create an enumeration. Like classes and all other named types, enumerations can have methods associated with them.\n\n\n\n```\nenum Rank: Int {\n    case ace = 1\n    case two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten\n    case jack, queen, king\n\n\n    func simpleDescription() -> String {\n        switch self {\n        case .ace:\n            return \"ace\"\n        case .jack:\n            return \"jack\"\n        case .queen:\n            return \"queen\"\n        case .king:\n            return \"king\"\n        default:\n            return String(self.rawValue)\n        }\n    }\n}\nlet ace = Rank.ace\nlet aceRawValue = ace.rawValue\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nWrite a function that compares two `Rank` values by comparing their raw values.\n\nBy default, Swift assigns the raw values starting at zero and incrementing by one each time, but you can change this behavior by explicitly specifying values. In the example above, `Ace` is explicitly given a raw value of `1`, and the rest of the raw values are assigned in order. You can also use strings or floating-point numbers as the raw type of an enumeration. Use the `rawValue` property to access the raw value of an enumeration case.\n\nUse the `init?(rawValue:)` initializer to make an instance of an enumeration from a raw value. It returns either the enumeration case matching the raw value or `nil` if there’s no matching `Rank`.\n\n\n\n```\nif let convertedRank = Rank(rawValue: 3) {\n    let threeDescription = convertedRank.simpleDescription()\n}\n\n```\n\nThe case values of an enumeration are actual values, not just another way of writing their raw values. In fact, in cases where there isn’t a meaningful raw value, you don’t have to provide one.\n\n\n\n```\nenum Suit {\n    case spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs\n\n\n    func simpleDescription() -> String {\n        switch self {\n        case .spades:\n            return \"spades\"\n        case .hearts:\n            return \"hearts\"\n        case .diamonds:\n            return \"diamonds\"\n        case .clubs:\n            return \"clubs\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nlet hearts = Suit.hearts\nlet heartsDescription = hearts.simpleDescription()\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nAdd a `color()` method to `Suit` that returns “black” for spades and clubs, and returns “red” for hearts and diamonds.\n\nNotice the two ways that the `hearts` case of the enumeration is referred to above: When assigning a value to the `hearts` constant, the enumeration case `Suit.hearts` is referred to by its full name because the constant doesn’t have an explicit type specified. Inside the switch, the enumeration case is referred to by the abbreviated form `.hearts` because the value of `self` is already known to be a suit. You can use the abbreviated form anytime the value’s type is already known.\n\nIf an enumeration has raw values, those values are determined as part of the declaration, which means every instance of a particular enumeration case always has the same raw value. Another choice for enumeration cases is to have values associated with the case — these values are determined when you make the instance, and they can be different for each instance of an enumeration case. You can think of the associated values as behaving like stored properties of the enumeration case instance. For example, consider the case of requesting the sunrise and sunset times from a server. The server either responds with the requested information, or it responds with a description of what went wrong.\n\n\n\n```\nenum ServerResponse {\n    case result(String, String)\n    case failure(String)\n}\n\n\nlet success = ServerResponse.result(\"6:00 am\", \"8:09 pm\")\nlet failure = ServerResponse.failure(\"Out of cheese.\")\n\n\nswitch success {\ncase let .result(sunrise, sunset):\n    print(\"Sunrise is at (sunrise) and sunset is at (sunset).\")\ncase let .failure(message):\n    print(\"Failure...  (message)\")\n}\n\/\/ Prints \"Sunrise is at 6:00 am and sunset is at 8:09 pm.\"\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nAdd a third case to `ServerResponse` and to the switch.\n\nNotice how the sunrise and sunset times are extracted from the `ServerResponse` value as part of matching the value against the switch cases.\n\nUse `struct` to create a structure. Structures support many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods and initializers. One of the most important differences between structures and classes is that structures are always copied when they’re passed around in your code, but classes are passed by reference.\n\n\n\n```\nstruct Card {\n    var rank: Rank\n    var suit: Suit\n    func simpleDescription() -> String {\n        return \"The (rank.simpleDescription()) of (suit.simpleDescription())\"\n    }\n}\nlet threeOfSpades = Card(rank: .three, suit: .spades)\nlet threeOfSpadesDescription = threeOfSpades.simpleDescription()\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nWrite a function that returns an array containing a full deck of cards, with one card of each combination of rank and suit.\n\n## [Concurrency](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Concurrency)\n\nUse `async` to mark a function that runs asynchronously.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc fetchUserID(from server: String) async -> Int {\n    if server == \"primary\" {\n        return 97\n    }\n    return 501\n}\n\n```\n\nYou mark a call to an asynchronous function by writing `await` in front of it.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc fetchUsername(from server: String) async -> String {\n    let userID = await fetchUserID(from: server)\n    if userID == 501 {\n        return \"John Appleseed\"\n    }\n    return \"Guest\"\n}\n\n```\n\nUse `async let` to call an asynchronous function, letting it run in parallel with other asynchronous code. When you use the value it returns, write `await`.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc connectUser(to server: String) async {\n    async let userID = fetchUserID(from: server)\n    async let username = fetchUsername(from: server)\n    let greeting = await \"Hello (username), user ID (userID)\"\n    print(greeting)\n}\n\n```\n\nUse `Task` to call asynchronous functions from synchronous code, without waiting for them to return.\n\n\n\n```\nTask {\n    await connectUser(to: \"primary\")\n}\n\/\/ Prints \"Hello Guest, user ID 97\".\n\n```\n\nUse task groups to structure concurrent code.\n\n\n\n```\nlet userIDs = await withTaskGroup(of: Int.self) { group in\n    for server in [\"primary\", \"secondary\", \"development\"] {\n        group.addTask {\n            return await fetchUserID(from: server)\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    var results: [Int] = []\n    for await result in group {\n        results.append(result)\n    }\n    return results\n}\n\n```\n\nActors are similar to classes, except they ensure that different asynchronous functions can safely interact with an instance of the same actor at the same time.\n\n\n\n```\nactor ServerConnection {\n    var server: String = \"primary\"\n    private var activeUsers: [Int] = []\n    func connect() async -> Int {\n        let userID = await fetchUserID(from: server)\n        \/\/ ... communicate with server ...\n        activeUsers.append(userID)\n        return userID\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nWhen you call a method on an actor or access one of its properties, you mark that code with `await` to indicate that it might have to wait for other code that’s already running on the actor to finish.\n\n\n\n```\nlet server = ServerConnection()\nlet userID = await server.connect()\n\n```\n\n## [Protocols and Extensions](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Protocols-and-Extensions)\n\nUse `protocol` to declare a protocol.\n\n\n\n```\nprotocol ExampleProtocol {\n     var simpleDescription: String { get }\n     mutating func adjust()\n}\n\n```\n\nClasses, enumerations, and structures can all adopt protocols.\n\n\n\n```\nclass SimpleClass: ExampleProtocol {\n     var simpleDescription: String = \"A very simple class.\"\n     var anotherProperty: Int = 69105\n     func adjust() {\n          simpleDescription += \"  Now 100% adjusted.\"\n     }\n}\nvar a = SimpleClass()\na.adjust()\nlet aDescription = a.simpleDescription\n\n\nstruct SimpleStructure: ExampleProtocol {\n     var simpleDescription: String = \"A simple structure\"\n     mutating func adjust() {\n          simpleDescription += \" (adjusted)\"\n     }\n}\nvar b = SimpleStructure()\nb.adjust()\nlet bDescription = b.simpleDescription\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nAdd another requirement to `ExampleProtocol`. What changes do you need to make to `SimpleClass` and `SimpleStructure` so that they still conform to the protocol?\n\nNotice the use of the `mutating` keyword in the declaration of `SimpleStructure` to mark a method that modifies the structure. The declaration of `SimpleClass` doesn’t need any of its methods marked as mutating because methods on a class can always modify the class.\n\nUse `extension` to add functionality to an existing type, such as new methods and computed properties. You can use an extension to add protocol conformance to a type that’s declared elsewhere, or even to a type that you imported from a library or framework.\n\n\n\n```\nextension Int: ExampleProtocol {\n    var simpleDescription: String {\n        return \"The number (self)\"\n    }\n    mutating func adjust() {\n        self += 42\n    }\n }\nprint(7.simpleDescription)\n\/\/ Prints \"The number 7\".\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nWrite an extension for the `Double` type that adds an `absoluteValue` property.\n\nYou can use a protocol name just like any other named type — for example, to create a collection of objects that have different types but that all conform to a single protocol. When you work with values whose type is a boxed protocol type, methods outside the protocol definition aren’t available.\n\n\n\n```\nlet protocolValue: any ExampleProtocol = a\nprint(protocolValue.simpleDescription)\n\/\/ Prints \"A very simple class.  Now 100% adjusted.\"\n\/\/ print(protocolValue.anotherProperty)  \/\/ Uncomment to see the error\n\n```\n\nEven though the variable `protocolValue` has a runtime type of `SimpleClass`, the compiler treats it as the given type of `ExampleProtocol`. This means that you can’t accidentally access methods or properties that the class implements in addition to its protocol conformance.\n\n## [Error Handling](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Error-Handling)\n\nYou represent errors using any type that adopts the `Error` protocol.\n\n\n\n```\nenum PrinterError: Error {\n    case outOfPaper\n    case noToner\n    case onFire\n}\n\n```\n\nUse `throw` to throw an error and `throws` to mark a function that can throw an error. If you throw an error in a function, the function returns immediately and the code that called the function handles the error.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc send(job: Int, toPrinter printerName: String) throws -> String {\n    if printerName == \"Never Has Toner\" {\n        throw PrinterError.noToner\n    }\n    return \"Job sent\"\n}\n\n```\n\nThere are several ways to handle errors. One way is to use `do`-`catch`. Inside the `do` block, you mark code that can throw an error by writing `try` in front of it. Inside the `catch` block, the error is automatically given the name `error` unless you give it a different name.\n\n\n\n```\ndo {\n    let printerResponse = try send(job: 1040, toPrinter: \"Bi Sheng\")\n    print(printerResponse)\n} catch {\n    print(error)\n}\n\/\/ Prints \"Job sent\".\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nChange the printer name to `\"Never Has Toner\"`, so that the `send(job:toPrinter:)` function throws an error.\n\nYou can provide multiple `catch` blocks that handle specific errors. You write a pattern after `catch` just as you do after `case` in a switch.\n\n\n\n```\ndo {\n    let printerResponse = try send(job: 1440, toPrinter: \"Gutenberg\")\n    print(printerResponse)\n} catch PrinterError.onFire {\n    print(\"I'll just put this over here, with the rest of the fire.\")\n} catch let printerError as PrinterError {\n    print(\"Printer error: (printerError).\")\n} catch {\n    print(error)\n}\n\/\/ Prints \"Job sent\".\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nAdd code to throw an error inside the `do` block. What kind of error do you need to throw so that the error is handled by the first `catch` block? What about the second and third blocks?\n\nAnother way to handle errors is to use `try?` to convert the result to an optional. If the function throws an error, the specific error is discarded and the result is `nil`. Otherwise, the result is an optional containing the value that the function returned.\n\n\n\n```\nlet printerSuccess = try? send(job: 1884, toPrinter: \"Mergenthaler\")\nlet printerFailure = try? send(job: 1885, toPrinter: \"Never Has Toner\")\n\n```\n\nUse `defer` to write a block of code that’s executed after all other code in the function, just before the function returns. The code is executed regardless of whether the function throws an error. You can use `defer` to write setup and cleanup code next to each other, even though they need to be executed at different times.\n\n\n\n```\nvar fridgeIsOpen = false\nlet fridgeContent = [\"milk\", \"eggs\", \"leftovers\"]\n\n\nfunc fridgeContains(_ food: String) -> Bool {\n    fridgeIsOpen = true\n    defer {\n        fridgeIsOpen = false\n    }\n\n\n    let result = fridgeContent.contains(food)\n    return result\n}\nif fridgeContains(\"banana\") {\n    print(\"Found a banana\")\n}\nprint(fridgeIsOpen)\n\/\/ Prints \"false\".\n\n```\n\n## [Generics](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Generics)\n\nWrite a name inside angle brackets to make a generic function or type.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc makeArray<Item>(repeating item: Item, numberOfTimes: Int) -> [Item] {\n    var result: [Item] = []\n    for _ in 0..<numberOfTimes {\n         result.append(item)\n    }\n    return result\n}\nmakeArray(repeating: \"knock\", numberOfTimes: 4)\n\n```\n\nYou can make generic forms of functions and methods, as well as classes, enumerations, and structures.\n\n\n\n```\n\/\/ Reimplement the Swift standard library's optional type\nenum OptionalValue<Wrapped> {\n    case none\n    case some(Wrapped)\n}\nvar possibleInteger: OptionalValue<Int> = .none\npossibleInteger = .some(100)\n\n```\n\nUse `where` right before the body to specify a list of requirements — for example, to require the type to implement a protocol, to require two types to be the same, or to require a class to have a particular superclass.\n\n\n\n```\nfunc anyCommonElements<T: Sequence, U: Sequence>(_ lhs: T, _ rhs: U) -> Bool\n    where T.Element: Equatable, T.Element == U.Element\n{\n    for lhsItem in lhs {\n        for rhsItem in rhs {\n            if lhsItem == rhsItem {\n                return true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n   return false\n}\nanyCommonElements([1, 2, 3], [3])\n\n```\n\nExperiment\n\nModify the `anyCommonElements(_:_:)` function to make a function that returns an array of the elements that any two sequences have in common.\n\nWriting `<T: Equatable>` is the same as writing `<T> ... where T: Equatable`.\n\n- [ A Swift Tour ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#app-top)\n\n- [ Simple Values ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Simple-Values)\n\n- [ Control Flow ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Control-Flow)\n\n- [ Functions and Closures ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Functions-and-Closures)\n\n- [ Objects and Classes ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Objects-and-Classes)\n\n- [ Enumerations and Structures ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Enumerations-and-Structures)\n\n- [ Concurrency ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Concurrency)\n\n- [ Protocols and Extensions ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Protocols-and-Extensions)\n\n- [ Error Handling ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Error-Handling)\n\n- [ Generics ](\/swift-book\/documentation\/the-swift-programming-language\/guidedtour\/#Generics)",
