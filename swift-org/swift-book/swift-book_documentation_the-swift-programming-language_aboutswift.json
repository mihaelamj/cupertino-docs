It’s a safe and fast programming language that combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from a diverse open source community.\n\nSwift is friendly to new programmers, without sacrificing the power and flexibility that experienced programmers need. It’s an industrial-quality programming language that’s as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language. The compiler is optimized for performance and the language is optimized for development, without compromising on either.\n\nSwift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:\n\n- Variables are always initialized before use.\n\n- Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.\n\n- Integers are checked for overflow.\n\n- Optionals ensure that `nil` values are handled explicitly.\n\n- Memory is managed automatically.\n\n- Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.\n\nSwift code is compiled and optimized to get the most out of modern hardware. The syntax and standard library have been designed based on the guiding principle that the obvious way to write your code should also perform the best. Its combination of safety and speed make Swift an excellent choice for everything from “Hello, world!” to an entire operating system.\n\nSwift combines a modern, lightweight syntax that’s familiar for developers coming from other popular languages with powerful features like type inference and pattern matching, allowing complex ideas to be expressed in a clear and concise manner. As a result, code is easier to read, write, and maintain.\n\nSwift continues to evolve with thoughtful new features and powerful capabilities. The goals for Swift are ambitious. We can’t wait to see what you create with it.",
